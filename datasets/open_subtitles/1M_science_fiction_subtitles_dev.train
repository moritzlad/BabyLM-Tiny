.I doubt they could take off again. They would be trapped with us. The ship looking for them would find it, find them, find us, find you. A brilliant cascade of cause-and-effect. Isn't the universe an amazing place? I wouldn't live anywhere else. Citizen G'Kar, Captain Martell would like to speak with you. Of course. Love to stay. Can't. Have to go. Kiss-kiss, love-love. Bye. I sometimes think that prolonged exposure to humans has driven him mad. You should be careful. Yes. Your name is Tirk, isn't it? That isn't a Drazi name. My mother created it. She says it means: "Don't touch me. I'm not having another child after this, ever. " That is a great deal of meaning to put into such a short name. They must be very, very proud of you. Yes. You wanted to see me, captain? G'Kar, yes. Please, come in. You were a military tactician before becoming an ambassador. - I'd like your thoughts. - Whatever I can do to help. I've been reviewing the enemy attack and something is bothering me. When the enemy jumped out, they targeted the Valen's engines first. Then they blew the hell out of Beta Durani 7 hit our weapons, then they hesitated. Do you see anything wrong with this picture? In combat, you destroy the biggest ship first by targeting the weapons array, since they're fairly volatile. You only go for the engines as a last resort since they're heavily shielded to keep radiation from affecting the crew. Exactly. As if they were trying to cripple the Valen instead of destroying it. Perhaps they wanted to capture us alive. That would explain the hesitation waiting for us to get to the escape pods find out how much we know. How much you know about what, G'Kar? G'Kar, why were you coming here in the first place? Who are these people? If we're gonna survive, we have to know what we're up against. That's what we were hoping to find out. Until recently, all we knew was that ships identical to the ones that attacked us are trying to destabilize the Alliance by attacking its weaker members. Then we learned that information relevant to this new race had been found at an archaeological dig at Beta Durani 7. Which was? Every spacefaring race has two things in common. First, they all have a food identical to what humans call "Swedish meatballs. " Don't ask. I don't understand it. It's just there. And they all share a myth about a time when ancient dark forces prowled the universe only to be cast down or cast away by an even greater force, a force of light. Until recently, I assumed that's all it was, myths. Then we received this recording from the archaeological team at Beta Durani 7. They found a city eight miles beneath the surface of the planet. A city billions of years old. Older than anything found before. According to the hieroglyphs this city was built by an ancient race that drove off the forces of darkness a billion years ago. They indicate that the enemy was driven from normal space into a place of eternal darkness. - A parallel dimension? - It's possible. The translators were still working on the rest of it. At first, they weren't sure how much to believe. Then they found this. What the hell is that? A door. To another place. Another space. We sent a probe through that door. It came back changed distorted beyond recognition. The hieroglyphs warned of a time when the enemy might return. We have reason to believe there is a connection between this and the ships that attacked us. And I can assure you that the entire situation is well in hand. I'll be back soon with more information. It'll all be just. Fine. Sorry. Tafeek said the other diplomats were starting to panic talking about getting in the escape pods and taking their chances outside. We tried to find you, but no one knew where you. You see, I'm with covert operations which is why I have the holo-suit, and sometimes it's necessary to. To. - I think I'll be going now. - Excellent idea. What's our status? Weapons are up to 25-percent capacity. About enough to take out a big rock. It's a start. You never know when you'll be attacked by somebody with a big rock. - We've got company. Routing it to your system. Have they seen us yet? Engines are running so far below normal it's getting lost in the electromagnetic noise generated by the local star. It's only a matter of time before they find us. There's only three options in combat: Run, fight or hide. We can't run. We can't fight. That leaves hide. Can you bring us in close to that comet? Put us right inside the tail? It'll be bumpy. We're talking explosive gas jets melting ice, chunks of rock being knocked off by steam venting but yeah, I can do it. Some chunks of rock and ice can be as big as we are. - I should be running weapons in case. - Understand that if you fire the enemy will see the energy spike. They'll come in right after us. That's the chance we'll have to take. Get us inside, Kit. Sarah, you'll only have a few seconds to ID a ship-killer and take it out so I'll leave it up to you. Just don't fire unless you think you absolutely have to, okay? Shouldn't have made that joke about taking out a rock. By the way, about the naming ceremony earlier. "I live to serve, I serve to live. " You say that every time. That's pretty lame, as far as your truth goes. Yeah, well, it's about as revealing as I want to get in this lifetime. See you on the other side of hell. It's okay, Sarah. Just sign up with the Liandra. I'm sure they just exaggerated that part about the ship being cursed. Oh, somebody just shoot me in the head. Oh, crap. - Sarah. - It's gonna miss us. It's gonna miss us. I'm reasonably sure it's gonna miss us. Oh, jeez. We've got damage to the hull. Losing air pressure in aft compartments. - If we stay here, we'll decompress. - Any sign of the enemy? I can't tell from inside here. We'll have to go out. All right. We'll have to take our chances. Move us away. Any sign of pursuit? Enemy ship moved away on an oblique angle. - We're clear. - Captain? Yes, Firell? There's a problem. First Officer Dulann is missing. What? What do you.? What do you want? And when we came back, Dulann was simply gone. Did he say anything before that? Anything at all? Nothing more than what he said to you. That something is wrong and that the spirits of this ship do not rest easy. What happened to kill the last crew is less of an issue than keeping this one alive. And I simply don't buy. Look, I've known Dulann for over three years. I know he's slightly telepathic but I don't buy this whole bit about sensing the dead. Minbari are sensitive to such things. Telepaths, even minor ones like Dulann are more sensitive still. And when one of our kind is near death the veil becomes very thin indeed. Perhaps what has stirred the dead here has some relevance to our current situation. We, like they, are facing the possibility we may never arrive home. - Perhaps. - Captain. - Any word on Dulann? - No. I've got every crewman I can spare searching the ship. He has to be here someplace. We'll find him. - Anything new at your end? - Possibly. It's just a thought. Right now, a thought would be good. Thank you, Firell. Come on. What's up? I tried to work up an analysis of the ships pursuing us but I'm getting nowhere because something doesn't make sense. Why chase us at all? The colony's gone. That news will get out whether we're alive or dead. And since the meeting was about them, it narrows down the list of suspects. So why put in all this time and effort chasing us down? Maybe they think we saw something during the attack that we could use against them. That's one possibility. Here's another. Maybe it's not information. Maybe we have something we don't know we have. Bridge to captain. - Yes? - They've found Dulann. Stay away. Get away from me. It's me. Dulann, it's me, David. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Just come with me back to. No. Listen. You don't understand. They're in me. They're inside my head. Dulann, listen to me. Your bloodstream is becoming toxic the longer you're out of Medbay. - What you're hearing isn't real. - No. Listen. Someone sold them out, betraying them. Now they feel the same happening again. Dulann, that's not possible. Everyone here was either on the Liandra or the Valen when the attack started. No. Check the records. Dulann, all of the records were erased. Private encoded log not on the main system. No one could find it. No one knew to erase it. Code word. Code word Entil'Zha. Healer! I need a healer in here, stat! Com system? Still down. Weapons? Still down. Captain? Definitely down. Ship. Check all records for encrypted files. Password required. Entil'Zha. We can get that out of the way and concentrate. Record found. Show me. Not much time left. Locked in as soon as the first attack hit. We're running out of air. I don't know who sold us out. I didn't see his face. Avenge us. We cannot rest until we are avenged. Whoever survives us is the one who killed us. We never gave up. We live for The One. We. Dulann was right. Maybe so but what does that have to do with our situation? He said there was a traitor onboard then and one aboard now. He was right about the first. Maybe he's right again. It can't be the same guy. Nobody here was on the Liandra when the first crew was killed. - No. But maybe it's enough there is a traitor onboard. Not that it's the same traitor. When those ships attacked the Valen they deliberately avoided hitting the weapons array. They could have taken it out immediately, but they didn't. They waited. But for what? The escape pods. They must have had someone onboard. A mole. Exactly. Nobody but Tannier knew where we were going till before we got there. A mole could've sent a signal to bring the enemy. They could've been shadowing us just beyond scanner range, waiting for the signal. Check the com records from the minute we jumped out until those ships attacked us. Look for any unusual signal. You should not be here. I am sorry. It is easy to get turned around in here. I take it from the equipment that all the high-powered relays go through this section. That is why you should not be here. You could be injured. Of course. Captain, I've found something in the com record. Listen. It came in on a subchannel. Auto-recorders confirm it's from the Valen. We. - What is it? - We're getting that same signal again. Amplified, strong enough to penetrate the overflow from the main com system. - Where's it coming from? - Cargo Bay 4. We can't put it on the PA, we'll scare him. You stay here, jam the signals. You come with me. Malcolm, you go that way. Come through the back. We'll catch him in between. - What the.? - David? I just saw Kafta in the passage leading to the escape pods. I'll check it out. Keep going. Pick up whoever else you can along the way. Hey, this area's off-limits. Hey, I said. Escape pod standing by. Tirk. - We need a healer, fast. - Kafta. It was Kafta. Oh, crap. David. Escape pod activated. - David, are you okay? - Yeah. Stick him in a holding cell until he wakes up. Something else. Tirk's been shot. They're bringing him to Medbay now. - What about the signal? - It was still sending. Malcolm disconnected it from the power relays. Let's hope we can jam it enough to keep it from going far. - Bridge to captain. - Yeah? It looks like the signal got through. We've got company. Confirm one enemy ship at 1 0,000 kilometers and closing. Outside maximum effective range for high-energy weapons. The other one probably isn't far. - What's the weapons status? - Thirty percent of maximum. It'll have to do. I feel like a jackrabbit. In, out, in, out. Engines? Eighty percent of maximum. You can thank me later. I'll do that. - Distance to jumpgate? - At this speed two hours, maybe three. All right, so we're back to three choices. Run, fight or hide. There's nowhere to hide, there's no weapons to speak of so we run. Na'Feel, I need you to give me everything you've got. If they jump to hyperspace, they'll overshoot us. There's only so fast you can travel in normal space. Pour it on and let's hope we get to the jumpgate before they close the distance. I've got an energy spike. Enemy ship is preparing to fire. Beam spread reduced the impact to 1 0 percent of effective strength. Closer it gets, the stronger the hits will become. Until they achieve hull-breaching capacity. We've got another spike. What the hell is that? Evasive maneuvers. - Mines! Come about! - No time. - Sarah, clear the road. - I'm on it. - We're clear. - Yes! Good shooting, Sarah. Thanks. - Launch countermeasures. - Launching. Even with countermeasures, that hit with 5 percent more energy than the last one. Correction, 1 0 percent and building fast. Twenty-five percent. Estimate we're a few more shots away from a kill. We're not gonna make it. We can't even slow them down. Maybe we can. - Bridge to Malcolm. - Right here. - You still have that signal device? - Right here. Drop it into an escape pod with a remote-controlled detonation cap and launch it. Move, move, move! The ambassador tried to escape into one of the pods when I stopped him. He told them what he was planning to do so when they see the pod launch, they'll think it's him. We're all set down here. Launch escape pod! Come on. Go for it, you son of a bitch. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. Wait for it. Now! Bring us back on course. Captain, there's something you should know. That last hit overloaded the weapons system. - How long until.? - We can't repair the weapons unless we bring the ship into docking for repairs. From this point on, we're completely defenseless. Okay, here's the deal. There's one more enemy ship out there. Tell me who they are and how to beat them and maybe you'll walk out of this room in one piece. How to beat them? Beat them? You really don't have the slightest idea of what you're up against, do you? What I know is that your people only recently joined the Alliance that you're on the fringe of Alliance territory and none of your ships have been bothered. I'm thinking maybe you made a deal and as part of that deal you joined up to spy on us for the other side. What do you think? I think that I have absolutely nothing to say to you. Let's try this again. Who are they? What do they want? - It won't do you any good. - I'm not gonna say it again. If you don't give me what I want, there's no reason to keep you alive. Rangers don't murder in cold blood. Yeah, well, lately, I've been having disciplinary problems. We live for The One, we die for The One. - If I go, you go! - Enough! Enough. What are we dealing with and who are they? They do not have a name as you understand the concept. They are called the Hand. The hand of God, the hand of Death. The hand that reaches forth and blots out whole suns. They have left a thousand worlds in their wake blackened cinders that were once thriving planets. For millions of years, they have been outcast hungrily staring out across the darkness between the stars searching for a way back, and now they have found it. The ships that are after us, are they the Hand? Those? Those are only toys given to those races who serve the Hand as I serve the Hand. Together we will prepare the way for their return. And part of preparing involves selling out the Alliance? Is that it? Because we could oppose them? If you had seen what I had seen, you would have done the same! Compared to the Hand the Shadows who straddled the galaxy on legs of fire during the Shadow War were nothing more than insects. If they're so powerful why are they interested in you? You must be small change as far as they're concerned. The Hand rewards loyalty. It is their only virtue. And they do not know what I know of their plans so they cannot allow my return to Minbar where I could be questioned further. They are coming, captain. You cannot stop them. You cannot fight them. You cannot defeat them. You can only join them or be ground into dust before them. Sarah, destination is in sight. Repeat, I can see the jumpgate. We're gonna make it. What? Let me see. Oh, my God. We did it. Oh, no. It isn't fair. It isn't fair! It's just sitting there, like a spider in a web. Why not? They know we've got no place else to go. If we try and run, they'll catch us. And run where? There's no jumpgate for two light-months. Captain, I'm picking up a holographic signal from the enemy ship. They want to talk. Put them through. This is Captain David Martell of the Ranger attack ship Liandra. - Identify yourself. What.? - You will release your prisoner or be destroyed. Well, he likes to get straight to the point, doesn't he? Destroy us and you don't get the prisoner. It seems, I don't know, counterproductive. Instructions were to exert every effort to reclaim the prisoner to avoid questioning. This has already cost us more than anticipated. Release him to us and you may leave this place alive. That solution is preferred by those we serve. But if destroying your ship is the only way to prevent him from being questioned further, we will do so. - I'm sure there must be some other. - There can be no negotiation. We await your decision. You're sure we have no weapons? No weapons at all? Nothing. But if you want, I'll put on a breather suit zip out an airlock and throw rocks at them. I'm game if you are. We're not gonna give up, are we? I mean, not after all this. You must know they won't let us leave here alive even if we do turn over the prisoner. I wouldn't. Well, it's tactically unwise. I'm going outside. I need some fresh air. There's nothing outside but hard vacuum. Typical. David. Hey. I was out for a walk, thought I'd stop in and see how you're doing. She says I'm dying. Other than that, not too bad. How are things with you? We're. Everything's just fine, Dulann. Nothing to worry about except hanging in until we get you to a real hospital. How curious. I was under the impression that we were trapped without weapons facing imminent destruction unless we turned over the prisoner. - Dulann, how did you know that? - They told me. Right. So, what are you going to do? Dulann, I don't know. I mean, it's like the Enfali all over again. No weapons, our engines are failing, we're outgunned. No, not like Enfali. We were outnumbered and outgunned. But there is just the one ship, yes? Yes. But, Dulann I've used every trick that I know of just to keep us alive this far. I've got nothing left. Then perhaps that is what you should use. - Nothing? - Yes. As in I've got nothing new to use? - Exactly. - Dulann, that's not. Enlightenment. I'll see you later. Are you sure? Positive. Malcolm, just the man I'm looking for. In light of the demands, make arrangements with the prisoner. - What are we gonna do? - Give them exactly what they want. Kit, open up a channel to the enemy ship. Yes, sir. We've made our decision. We will agree to turn the prisoner over to you in exchange for safe passage for myself and my crew. - What? - David, don't do this. There's no other way, nothing we can do. Where is the prisoner now? I've asked one of my crewmen to escort him to the escape pod. He should be launching any time. We know what you did to our sister ship. We will scan the pod to ensure that Minister Kafta is aboard and that there are no remote-controlled devices onboard and we will make contact with him once he is clear of your vessel. If any one of these precautions indicate trickery. Understood. Escape pod is launching. They're scanning the pod. Keep the pod directly between us and the alien ship. Well, they won't shoot at us as long as he's between us. They're opening up a com channel. I am safe. It is as we thought. They have no stomach for death. Now, please take me aboard. I grow weary of their presence. You have done well. Our scan of the pod confirms that you have followed our instructions to the letter. Of course. What would be the point in trying anything else? A race as advanced as yours there's no way you'd fall for the same gag twice. - Now, about our safe passage. - Stand by. For a moment there, I thought you came up with some kind of angle I just couldn't figure out. But your angle was to give them what they wanted. Yes, it was. Okay, I'm parking the ship right here and we're not leaving until somebody tells me what the hell just happened here. Back on Earth there were two train robbers in the North American West Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. They came up with a great idea. Rob a train, wait two days then rob the same train all over again in exactly the same way. Because nobody ever figured they'd pull the same gag twice in a row. Since we had nothing left to pull, I thought we'd try the same thing. Since they were gonna scan the pod we couldn't put any large, remote-controlled detonators inside so I borrowed about 50 grenades from the armory. And Kafta? He was responsible for the death of over 1 000 people onboard the Valen and Beta Durani 7. He wanted to join his associates. He did. So that's why you wanted me to keep the ship on a straight line with the pod. So they'd think the transmission was coming from the pod. They know what we did last time and they knew that we knew that they knew. So they made the logical assumption that we wouldn't dare try it again. And you didn't tell us this. Because I wanted your reactions to be sincere. They were. Kit take us through the gate. - Put us on a beacon for Minbar. - Yes, sir. It's been a damn long day. Your actions aboard the Liandra are to be commended. My actions onboard the Liandra were born out of desperation. I'm not proud of them. I keep going over it in my head thinking I could have done something more found some other way. We all ask such questions. Upon learning what happened I wondered, had we been less harsh with you had you been allowed to command the Valen instead of Tannier would the same thing have happened? Tannier acted honorably. He gave his life to buy us time to get away. He did as well as anyone could have done under the circumstances. As did you. Those are important words, David. "Under the circumstances. " We do the best we can with what we are given. We are imperfect reflections of the universe around us. We cannot change the past, we can only learn from it and try to create a future in which such errors do not recur. Sadly, we're still working on that last part. I guess the question now is, where do we go from here? Figured I'd find you up here. I stopped off at the hospital and saw Dulann. He's looking better. Yeah, they say he should be on his feet in a few days. Tirk, well, he's gonna take a little while longer but he says he'll be ready when we need him. Whenever that is. So how long are we grounded for this time? Not long. Just until they get her up and running again. The Liandra? It's the only one available. But there's no rush this time. They'll make sure she's in top condition before we go. Right. Top condition for a cursed 20-year-old ship that's been through, what, two wars, four crews some of which are still there, in a sort of, kind of dead kind of way. Dulann thinks since we found the traitor and saved the ship, they'll be quiet now. At least for a while. As for the Liandra well, the funny thing is, I really don't mind. Maybe it has something to do with going through all that together but as far as ships go I think this one will do just fine. So do we have a mission yet? - I greatly appreciate the ride, captain. - No, it's my pleasure, G'Kar. You know, rumor has it you spent the last few years just wandering the galaxy. - Yes, with a friend. She's gone now. It was. Well, there are no words, really. There are things out there beyond imagination and I have a rather healthy imagination. You'll have to tell me about it sometime. No reason for it. The path I took is not the path you will take and where you walk, you will see things even more astonishing and you will do so in fine company. Nearing Epsilon jumpgate. Prepare to jump. I hope the security conference goes well. Let us know if you come up with anything. - I will. - Standing by. Jump. I should get my bags. Are you coming aboard? No. No, we have to get back. You know, actually, I've never seen it before. Maybe next time, we'll stop over for a few days. You should. It's quite a place. A place of good times and bad of pain and growth, but in the end a place of great hope. But if you ever do come aboard, remember one thing: No one there is exactly what he seems. But then who is? Replacement team's here, sir. Right. Come on through. 20 minutes and we were gonna start looking for you. Yeah. It's really something out there. - You look a mess, sir. - Yeah? Your turn next, Ginsburg. OK. I'll see you in 24. See you tomorrow. What was that you were you saying? You used to hear her chant all night long. Om mahneypod me om. - Om mahneypod me om. - Over the plants? She'd cup her hands over those seeds and chant by the hour. She grew the most beautiful wandoos you ever saw, man. Primo stuff. Resin city. Stand clear. The commander's been worried about you. The roads must be a bear. - What roads? - Visibility. Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't been on time for the last six months. - I wrote you guys up in the logbook. - Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan. Good night, gentlemen! So, that was like sinsemilia, right? Sinsemilla. This grass made Thai stick taste like oregano. Lay you out flat, man. - Got a red light, sir. - What on? Number eight. Warhead alarm. Give it a thump with your finger. Alarm reset. Skybird, this is Dropkick with a Red dash Alpha message in two parts. Break. Break. Red dash Alpha. - Stand by to copy message. - Standing by. Romeo Oscar November Charlie Tango Tango Lima Alpha. Authentication: 220040 Delta Lima. I have a valid message. Stand by to authenticate. I agree with authentication also, sir. - Enter launch code. - Entering launch code. - Launch order confirmed. - Holy shit! Target selection: complete. Time on target sequence: complete. - Yield selection: complete. - Begin countdown. Tminus 60. - All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key. - Stand by. - Launch key inserted. - Roger. On my mark. rotate launch key to Set. Three. two. one. - Mark. - Tminus 50. Roger. At Set. - Sir? - Tminus 40. - Enable missiles. - Number one enabled. Two enabled. - Three enabled. - Get somebody on the goddamn phone. Seven. eight. Nine. Ten. All missiles enabled. - Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line. - That's not the correct procedure. - Try SAC Headquarters on the HF. - That's not the procedure. I want somebody on the goddamn phone before I kill 20 million people. T minus 20. I got nothin' here! They might have been knocked out already. Right. On my mark, rotate launch keys to Launch. Roger. Ready to go to Launch. - Fourteen. - Thirteen. twelve. Eleven. Seven. six. - Five. - Sir, we have a launch order. - Three. two. - Put your hand on the key, sir. One. Launch! - Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key! - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Turn your key, sir! They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up. - Hello. I'm Pat Healy. - I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot. I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant. I've got some passes for you here. We had scheduled a meeting pending your arrival. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I'd be happy to fill you in if there's any way I can. They're here. Good. Let's go. Cabot and Watson came alone. No senators. No congressmen. I wish they'd brought a few senators. I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here. John, please! Don't start that right away. I had them on the phone and they're calmed down. Well, are we positive that these men had no way of knowing this was only a test? Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times are we gonna go through this? - It doesn't make any difference. - I've spoken to these men. They all believed it was the real deal. Look, we gotta be on a plane in less than an hour. I have to explain to the president why 22% of his missile commanders failed to launch their missiles. What am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad? The president knows that I am fully responsible for the men in my command. I've ordered a re-evaluation of our psychological screening procedure. Wait a minute. Excuse me, General. We can't ask these men to go back to the president with a lot of headshrinker horseshit! You can't screen out human response! Those men know what it means to turn the keys, and some are just not up to it! Now, it's as simple as that! I think we oughta take the men out of the loop. - Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir. - Why am I out of line? Excuse me! I'm sorry. I don't understand. Take them out of the loop? Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos since before any of you were watching Howdy Doody. For myself, I sleep pretty well at night knowing those boys are down there. General, we know they're fine men, but in a nuclear war we can't afford to have missiles lying dormant in those silos because those men refuse to turn the keys when the computers tell 'em to! You mean when the president orders them to. The president will probably follow the computer war plan. That's a fact! I imagine the Joint Chiefs will have some input. - You're damn tootin'. - Well, hell. In a surprise attack, there's no time. 23 minutes from warning to impact. - Six minutes if it's sub-launched. - Six minutes. That's barely enough time for the president to make a decision. Once he makes the decision, the computer should take over. Now, sir, I know that you've got a plane waiting for you, but if you could indulge me, I'd like to show you something. These computers give instant access to the state of the world. Troop movements, Soviet missile tests, weather patterns. It all flows into this room, and then into the WOPR computer. - WOPR? What is that? - War Operation Plan Response. This is Mr Richter. Paul, would you like to tell these gentlemen about the WOPR? Well, the WOPR spends all its time thinking about World War Ill. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, it plays an endless series of war games using all available information on the state of the world. The WOPR has already fought World War Ill, as a game, time and time again. It estimates Soviet responses to our responses to their responses, and so on. Estimates damage. Counts the dead. Then it looks for ways to improve its score. The point is that the key decisions of every option have already been made by the WOPR. So all this trillion-dollar hardware is really at the mercy of those men with the little brass keys? That's exactly right. Whose only problem is that they're human beings. But in 30 days we could put in electronic relays. Get the men out of the loop. Gentlemen. I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of microchips further than I could throw it. I don't know if you wanna trust the safety of our country to some. silicon diode. Nobody is talking about entrusting the safety of the nation to a machine, for God's sake! We'll keep control, but here at the top where it belongs. All right, gentlemen. I think I'm going to recommend McKittrick's idea to the president. And I'll get back to you on this. You won't regret this. OK. You had fries and a Coke, right? Damn! - Hi, David! - Hi, Howie! - How's it going? - Pretty good. - You wanna take this over? I gotta go. - Sure! - Go ahead. - Thanks! - Bye, David! - Bye! All right. Question number two. Seeds that are germinated in water before they are planted will. what? - Robert? - Sprout roots? Ah! David! Nice of you to join us. Oh, David. I have a little present for you. Question number four. In the history of science, novel and innovative concepts occasionally arise from sudden left-field inspiration. Miss Mack. Could you tell us your answer to question number four? Why do nitrogen nodules cling to the roots of plants? Love? Jennifer, what do you know about nitrogen nodules that we don't? Some bit of salacious info to which you alone are privy? - No. - I see. No, you didn't know the correct answer - symbiosis. Because you don't pay attention in class. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There seems to be a lot of confusion on this next question - asexual reproduction. Could someone tell me, please who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex? - Miss Mack! - Yes? What is so amusing? What? All right, Lightman. Maybe you can tell us who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex. Your wife? Get out, Lightman! Get out! Mr Ligget wants me to discuss my attitude problem with Mr Kessler. I think Mr Kessler's getting tired of your attitude problem. Me, too. Lightman. What a. surprise. Won't you come in? Hi! Hi! Sorry if I got you in trouble. I couldn't stop laughing. That's OK. You were perfect. - I was? - Yeah. - You want a ride home? - Yeah. Hop on. - So you got an F on that test today, too? - Yep. Guess we're both gonna be stuck in summer school. - Not me. - Why not? You have to make up biology. - I don't think so. - Why not? - Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not? - Make a left. Why don't you come up to my house and I'll show you? What are you gonna show me? I'm gonna show you. I'll show you how you do it. - Hi, Bo! - Oh! Hi, Bo! Hey, Bo! How you doin'? My room's upstairs. - Your parents aren't home? - No. They both work. A little mess. It's OK. You should see my room. - You're really into computers, huh? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm dialing into the school's computer. They change the password every couple of weeks, but I know where they write it. - Are those your grades?! - Yeah. I don't think that I deserved an F, do you? - You can't do that! - Already done. - Do you have a middle initial? - K. Katherine. Those are my grades. - How can anybody get a D in home EC? - That's none of your business. - Can you erase this? - No. It's too late. What are you doing? - I'm changing your biology grade. - No. You'll get me in trouble. Nobody can find out. You got a C! Now you won't go to summer school. - Change it back. - Why? They can't. - I said change it back. - OK. OK. I guess I'd better get going. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. OK. Bye. Bye. Get down. Get down. You've already had your dinner. Now just sit. Sit! Stay! - Don't forget to take out the garbage. - David. - Put that lid on real tight. - I know, Ma. Yes, they will carry back on the second. Sure. I think we can really work out some creative financing. Oh, but you've gotta see it! There's a Jacuzzi in the master bedroom. Oh, sure. We can work that out. That is true. You'll have a balloon payment at the end of five years. But that's nothing. The economy is gonna be great then. He who dances must pay the piper. - See you, Dad. - I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye. You know, I worry about that kid. Why? Sometimes I think we're all gonna get electrocuted. This corn is raw! I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp. - Of course it's crisp! It's raw! - It's terrific! You can just taste the vitamin A and D in here. It's great. Couldn't we have pills, and cook the corn? - What city, please? - For Sunnyvale, California. The number for Protovision. Yes. That's 555 8632. Thank you. Could you also tell me what other prefixes cover that area? There's 399, 437, 767, 936. Thanks. Protovision. I have you now. Yes? Saul's Fish Market. - Hi! - Oh, hi! What? I've been thinking. That thing with my grade. - Can you still change it? - Oh, I don't know. I can't believe I was so stupid. I should've just let you do it. - I don't know. It might be kinda rough. - Why? They might have changed the password. Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try? - Damn! - Please. OK. - You owe me a quarter. - Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game. - What's it doing? - Oh. It's dialing numbers. - Don't touch the keys! - I'm not touching the keys. Excuse me. This computer company's coming out with these amazing new games soon. The programs are probably still on their computer. So I told my system to search for other computers in Sunnyvale, California. They answer with a tone that other computers can recognize. You hear? You're calling every number in Sunnyvale? - Isn't that expensive? - There's ways around that. You can go to jail for that. Only if you're over 18. Is this going to take a long time? I'd like to get my grade changed. Oh. That's funny, actually. Cos. I already changed it. - I told you not to do that. - Yeah, I know. But I figured you'd change your mind. I didn't want you to flunk. - Well, what did I get? - You got a D. - You gave me a D? - No. You got an A. - I was kidding. - Oh. Well, that's OK. Here. Let's see what we have so far. Excuse me. Did you really give me an A? Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hey! You got a bank! Gotta make a note of that one. Might come in handy someday. Pan Am. - Where shall we go? - Anywhere? - Anywhere. - New York? - New York. OK. - No, Paris. Paris. Will you be traveling alone? Yeah. No. You wanna go with me? OK. - All right. Smoking or nonsmoking? - Nonsmoking. All right, Miss Mack. You're confirmed on Pan Am's flight 1 14 Ieaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport at 8.15am on 18 August. Do we need a rental car? No. - Do we really have tickets to Paris? - No. You have a reservation though. It doesn't identify itself. Try anything. "Connection terminated." How rude. We'll ask it for help. - Can you do that? - On some systems. The more complicated they are, the more they have to help you out. Now what? Help games. "Games" refers to models, simulations and games which have strategic applications. What does that mean? I don't know. That's gotta be them. Turn on the printer. List games. Oh, my God! So these guys can tell you what that print-out means? They probably invented it in the first place. - Can you wait here? - Why? - Cos these guys can get a little nervous. - OK. Jim. Oh. Lightman. Hi, Lightman! I want you to take a look at this. - Hey! What's that? - I wanted Jim to see that. Wow! Where'd you get this? Protovision. I wanted to see the program for their new games. - Can I have this? - I'm not through yet. Remember you told me to tell you when you were acting rudely and insensitively? You're doing it right now. "Theatrewide biotoxic and chemical warfare." - This didn't come from Protovision. - Ask him where it did come from, Jim! - I told you already. - Looks military to me. Definitely. - Probably classified, too. - If it's military, why does it have games - Iike checkers and backgammon? - Those games teach basic strategy. Jim, how do I get into that system? I wanna play those games. That system probably contains the new data encryption algorithm. - You'll never get in. - No system is totally secure. - I bet you Jim could get in. - I bet you he couldn't! - I bet you he could. - You won't get through frontline security. - But you might look for a back door. - I can't believe it, Jim! That girl's listening, and you talk about back doors! Mr Potato-head. Mr Potato-head! Back doors are not secrets! - You're giving away all our best tricks. - They're not tricks. - What's a back door? - Whenever I design a system I put in a password that only I know about. That way, whenever I wanna get back in, I can bypass whatever security they've added on. That's basically what it is. Yeah? OK. You really wanna get in, find out about the guy who designed the system. Come on! I don't even know the guy's name. Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are so dumb. I got this thing all figured out. Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it? The first game in the list. Go right through Falken's Maze. Hi! I'm Jennifer. - Is David here? - How do you do? Yeah. He's up in his room. Thanks. Have you ever heard of the word tumulus? Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry. Neither have l. Yeah? Hi! - Where have you been? - What? I haven't seen you all week in school. Are you sick? No, no. I was. I was doing things. You wanna sit down? How are you? - No. I'm going to get some water, OK? - OK. - What is all that stuff? - Oh, it's nothing. I was just. I was trying to find out about the guy who designed those game programs, so I could get his secret password. - Why? - Why? Cos. What's so special about playing games with some machine? Oh, no. No, it's not just some machine. Here. Look at this. This is a tape that I got from the library. It's about this guy named Falken. He was into games as well as computers. He designed them so that they could play checkers or poker. - Chess. - What's so great about that? - Everybody's doing that now. - Oh, no, no. What he did was great! He designed his computer so it could learn from its mistakes. So they'd be better the next time they played. The system actually learned how to learn. It could teach itself. If I could just get that damn password, I could play the computer. That's him. That's Falken. That's him? Wow! He's amazing-looking! Can't you write to him or call him somehow? No. He's dead. - He's dead? - Yeah. Here. Look. Here's his obituary. - He wasn't very old. - Well, he was pretty old. He was 41 . Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old. That's his little boy. Oh, yeah? This is really sad. Did you know the child and his mother were killed in a car crash? - I know. - "In the years that followed the tragic loss of his family, Dr Falken's health deteriorated." My dad is 45. - Once he was really sick. - What was his name? - My father? - No, no, no. Falken's kid. Joshua. It can't be that simple. - Wow! - What? We got something. We're in! It thinks I'm Falken! Hello. - How can it ask you that? - It'll ask whatever it's programmed to. - Do you wanna hear it talk? - Yeah! I'll ask it how it feels. I'm fine. How are. you? Excellent. It's been a long time. Can you explain the removal of your user account on June 23rd, 1973? They must have told it he died. People sometimes make. mistakes. - Yes, they do. - How can it talk? It's not a real voice. This box interprets signals and turns them into sound. Shall we play a game? Oh! - I think it missed him. - Yeah. Weird, isn't it? Love to! How about Global Thermonuclear War? Wouldn't you prefer a good game of chess? Later. Let's play Global Thermonuclear War. Fine. All right! Wow! Which side do you want? I'll be the Russians. Please list primary targets. - Who shall we nuke first? - Let's see. How about. Las Vegas? Las Vegas! Great! - What next? Seattle! - Yeah! Kill 'em! I have seven, correction, eight Red birds two degrees past apogee. Better get the old man down here. We have Soviet missile warning. Check formal function and report confidence. Projected target areas NORAD regions 25, 26. This is Crystal Palace initiating emergency conference. Stand by! 19 degrees past apogee. Possible 18 targets in track. Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu. - What you got up here, Joe? - We have a radar tracking. Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs already over the pole. Estimated impact: 1 1 minutes. Target area: Western United States. - Why didn't we get a launch detection? - We're checking for DSP malfunction. BMEWS has continuous radar tracking on inbounds. Confidence is high. I repeat, confidence is high. - What is all that stuff? - Trajectory headings - for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles. - What does that mean? I don't know. But it's great! - Are those bombs? Which is the bombs? - Subs. - Blow 'em up. - Blow 'em out of the water. - What's a trajectory heading? - I've no idea. The president's diverting to Andrews. The vice president is out of position. - The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on. - Missile warning reports no malfunction. Take us to DEFCON 3. Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to flush the bombers. Yes, sir. SAC, this is Crystal Palace. CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3. Scramble all alert aircraft. I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft. Inbounds presently MIRVing. We now have approximately 24 possible targets in track. - New time to impact: eight minutes. - SAC is launching the bombers. - General Powers is on the line. - Beringer. Goddamn it! We didn't get a launch detection from our satellite. Radar picked 'em up already out of the atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it. Get the ICBMs in the bullpen warmed up and ready to fly. - Get me the president on the horn. - Yes, sir. Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD. Oh, attack! - I wonder if I should use my subs. - Sure. Give 'em the works. David! Excuse me. David! How many times have I told you to fasten these lids on tight?! - Look at this mess! - I'll be down in a few minutes. Now! Come down now! I want this cleared up now! Come down here and do what your father asks you to pronto, David. We're gonna barbecue tonight. - You wanna invite your little friend? - Please! David! Shit! Little friend. Mr President, something's happening. I'll get back to you as soon as I know. - What's happening, Joe? - BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report negative confirmation on all inbound tracking. Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady. Stop! It's a simulation! There's an attack simulation running! What the hell's he yelling about? I didn't order that. We're not being attacked! It's a simulation! Whoa, now! Hold it! You're not supposed to be runnin' here. We don't know how it happened. Someone outside fed an attack simulation into the main. It's a simulation! Conley. Take us off full alert. Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly what in the hell's happening here! I didn't tell you to cut the line! Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line! They shut down before we could complete our trace. We did locate the area where the transmission originated. - Where? - Seattle, Washington. Shut it down! Somebody's playing a game with us. At a prophylactic recycling centre. Hi, Dad! David! - David, come in here! - What did I do? Plenty, mister. Plenty. You have just passed all of your classes this semester. Congratulations, dear! Show this to your dad. Honey! David has something to show you. - What's that? - Here, Dad. Uh-oh. This is good! I'm so proud of you! ..went on a full-scale nuclear alert, believing the Soviet Union had launched a missile attack. A spokesman places blame on a computer malfunction, emphasizing that the problem has been corrected. For more on the story, let's go live to Washington DC. Well, that's your phone. Yeah. Seriously, David. Congratulations. This one'll be a pleasure to sign! - Hello? - David? Are you watching the news? Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching. David, is that us on TV? Did we do that? It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer! What am I gonna do? They're gonna come get me. I'm really screwed! I'm screwed! No! Sh! Calm down! Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen. If they were so smart, they would have found you already. Yeah. OK. So all you have to do is throw the number away and don't call it again. - That's all. - Yeah. - Maybe they didn't trace the call. - Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call. I'm sure they didn't trace the call. All you have to do is act normal. We'll both act normal and everything will be fine. OK? - OK. - OK. God! This is so unbelievable! Can I call Michelle and tell her? No, Jennifer! Don't call her! Sorry. All right. I won't. I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK? OK. Good night, Jennifer. Greetings, Professor Falken. Oh, my God. Incorrect identification. I am not Falken. Falken is dead. Sorry to hear that, Professor. Yesterday's game was interrupted. Although primary goal has not yet been achieved, solution is near. Game time elapsed: 31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds. Estimated time remaining: 52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds. What is the primary goal? You should know, Professor. You programmed me. Oh, come on. What is the primary goal? To win the game. David Lightman, hold it right there. FBI. - I'll read you your rights. - Step over to the van. You have the absolute right to remain silent. What did I do? You have the right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you by the court. - Do you understand these rights? - Yeah. Are you willing to talk to me about the charges against you? All right. Let's move. This rather large room is command center for NORAD. No picture taking. The screens in front of you are connected to our satellites and missile tracking stations throughout the country. This is the commander's desk. Colonel Conley is in charge. Would you mind relinquishing your command, sir? Miss Dailey, would you come and sit in this rather important chair? These buttons are connected with the Strategic Air Command and missile launching stations. Miss Dailey, would you press this button here? The red one. - The one in the middle? - Yes, ma'am. Oh, my God! It's the wrong one! It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything. Look what you did do. "Distinguished visitors from Birmingham." Last week I had the governor of New Jersey in this chair. He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now. Why are we at DEFCON 4? The Soviets saw our bombers scramble and went on alert. We told them it was just an exercise, but we want them to relax their posture first. Wait. Wait. - Give me that. - Oh, Christ. Another tour group. Just what we need today. Why don't they go to Disneyland where they belong? - Well, I think they're going to tomorrow. - OK. All set? Oh, here. It was a one-in-a-million shot. There was an open line at our division in Sunnyvale. The phone company screwed up! - John. John McKittrick, George Wigan. - How are you? George is with the FBI. He brought the kid in. It looks like we've got a high-school prank on our hands. Paul, what happened? The kid broke into the war game using a password left by the original programmer. - A password? - Yes, sir. None of my team even knew it was there. Kid claims he was looking for a toy company. That's great! Anybody in here buy that one? We can find the password and take it out, but it might help to beef up security. Oh. Beef up, huh? How about screwed up? We did all that and he broke in again. Kid says your computer called him. What the hell is going on, John? I woke up the president. I told him we were under attack by the Russians. You know what an idiot that makes me look? Not to mention the general. I think we're being a little naive here. There is no way a high-school punk can put a dime in a telephone and break into our system. He's got to be working with somebody else. He fits the profile perfectly. He's intelligent, but an underachiever. Alienated from his parents. Has few friends. Classic case for recruitment by the Soviets. What does this say about the state of our country? I mean, have you gotten any insight as to why a bright boy like this would jeopardies the lives of millions? He says he does this sort of thing for fun. Dammit, John, I want some answers, and I want 'em now! - Let me talk to this little prick. - I don't wanna talk. Just do it! Come on, Paul. Who do they belong to? Do you know? What? Good morning, sir. - Where's the Lightman kid? - In the infirmary, sir. Hello, David. John McKittrick. I run the computer facility here. Sergeant, these aren't necessary, the handcuffs? No, sir. Well, David, we called your parents. We told them everything's fine. No charges have been filed. yet. But I think we are gonna need a little time to sort things out here. How much time? Well, that depends on how willing you are to cooperate. Oh, of course. Sergeant, would you tell the OD I'm gonna take David for a little walk? Let's go down to my office. We'll be more comfortable there. Go ahead. You used to work with Stephen Falken? I started as his assistant. How d'you know? I read an article you wrote with him on poker and nuclear war. Bluffing. Yeah, that shook a few people up. - He must have been pretty amazing. - He's a brilliant man. A little flaky. He never understood the practical uses of his. of his work. This machine over here runs his game program. Joshua. Come here a minute, David. See that sign up here? Up here? - Yeah. - DEFCON. That indicates our current defense condition. It should read DEFCON 5, which means peace. It's still on 4 because of that little stunt you pulled. Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time, it might have gone to DEFCON 1 . - You know what that means, David? - No. What does that mean? World War Ill. Wow. You broke into our system just to play a game, right? That's right. That's exactly right. After the news, you must have realized how serious it was. - Why'd you do it again? - I didn't do it again. - I even threw the number away. - They found it in the trash. Joshua called me. Hey! Look at that! That's some setup. - What did you say? - This is some setup. No, no. Before that. Joshua called me. David, machines don't call people. Yours did. Who are you going to Paris with? Paris? Oh! No. You don't understand. You had reservations for two to Paris. - Who are you working with? - Nobody! Why don't I believe you? I don't think I should say anything else until I talk to a lawyer. I think we'd better forget about the lawyer crap until I get a few answers out of you myself. Are you gonna answer the phone? Hello. Yeah. What? All right. I'll be right down. You stay here. Don't move. What's going on? There's been a serious penetration into our WOPR execution order file. - What the hell's he sayin'? - In English. I'll give it to you. Somebody got into Mr McKittrick's system and stole the codes that'll launch our missiles. There's no cause for alarm. The system won't accept a launch code unless we're at DEFCON 1 . I can change those codes in an hour. Well, who did this? I think the kid's working with somebody on the outside. I don't know what they're up to, but I don't want our bombers on the ground. Take us to DEFCON 3 and get SAC on the line. - Where are you? - Sir. Get me an update on those subs. I wanna know what those bastards are up to. Joshua. Greetings, Professor Falken. Hello. Are you still playing the game? Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1 and launch my missiles in 28 hours. Would you like to see some projected kill ratios? 69% of the housing destroyed. 72 million people dead? Is this a game or is it real? What's the difference? Oh, wow. You are a hard man to reach. Could not find you in Seattle and no terminal is in operation at your classified address. What classified address? DOD pension files indicate current mailing as: Dr Robert Hume. AKA Stephen W Falken. 5 Tall Cedar Road, Goose island, Oregon 97. Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick? I think I know what's going on. I'm escorting you to Denver where you'll be placed under arrest, - pending indictment for espionage. - Espionage?! Let me talk to him! He's right over there. - Get that bastard out of the war room! - No! It's Joshua! He's still playing the game! He's gonna start a war! Hold him where you had him before. We'll leave in a few minutes. Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please, call him. Please, call him. Call him! What the hell's he doing in here anyway? Some of the men told me that you're quite a tennis player. Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent with use of marijuana and possibly PCP. Depending on what information you want, there's a button to press. Let's say I wanted to find out how to hit a backhand. I don't think I have the right program. Excuse me. What do you want? Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver. Excuse me. Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick. You can't talk to anybody. The FBI be here any minute. - Do you have to take a leak or not? - No. - I'm working here. - Oh, I'm sorry. Stop it! - You have pretty eyes. - That's original. I'll get the elevator. - Sign in here? - Yeah, get us all. I heard they voted you Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true? Will you stop it?! - Am I bothering you? - Yes. - Do you want me to leave? - Yes. I want this door open right now. - How about getting on the phone? - Is there a technician? Hey, Scooter! Wait up. Come on, hurry it up. I'm late. OK. I'll be right with you. - I think it's jammed from inside. - Come on. David! Come on, David. You're just making it harder on yourself. OK. Let's go. Right this way, folks. I've been informed that they're cleaning the floors in the computer center. Don't want anyone to slip and hurt themselves, so we'll end the tour here. If I can ask you to board the bus as quickly as possible, you'll have a complimentary beverage waiting for each of you. Hold it! What are you doing? Got it. Here it comes. - You kids think you own this place? - Oh! I was. just looking around. You're not supposed to leave the group. So get back there! OK. Excuse me. Thank you very much, sir. Out of the way. Thank you. Careful there. Take care. Watch your step. - Bye. - Bye now. Watch your step. - Check everywhere. He can't be far. - Move it, will you? - Thanks. - Take care. Bye. - What city, please? - Goose island, Oregon, please. The number for Dr Robert Hume, H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road. Checking under Dr. Robert Hume, H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road, I find no listing. What does that mean? He doesn't have a phone? I'm sorry. I have no listing. Oh, wait. Falken. Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address. I find no listing for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N, on Tall Cedar Road, Goose island. Thank you. Yeah? Jennifer? It's me. David. - David? - Yeah. Listen, I'm in Colorado and I need a really big favour. - Can you lend me some money? - What? I need an airline ticket. I'll pay you back when I can. I need a ticket from Grand Junction, Colorado to Oregon. - Why? What's going on? - I'll tell you all about it later. David, what are you doing in Colorado? I went by your house. Your parents were just freaked. There are men around from the FBI asking questions. I can't talk about it right now. When you buy the ticket, tell them that I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport. David, what's happening? I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone. Please, will you just do this for me? Punch up number five. Let me see what you have. 22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees. Sergeant, I hope you like vodka. Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me eat none of them damn fish eggs. Give me an update. Sir, the Soviets deny any increase in their submarine deployment. They wanna know why we're provoking them. They're full of shit. We know they're down there. I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water. Surprise! - What are you doing here? - You didn't sound too good on the phone. - You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble. - Why? Is this because of what you did with my grade? You kids better hustle. The ferry leaves any second. Thanks. Come on. We gotta run. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa! - Hold it, hold it! If he's still alive, why would the obituary say he's dead? No, he's not dead. He left. When they know too much, they give 'em new identities. - Anyway, the computer said so. - Oh, the computer said so. The computer that's still playing the games? It's the military's computer! - Why wouldn't they know about it? - They don't know about Joshua. Falken knows about Joshua. He's the only one who knows what it can do. That computer is trying to win the game that we asked it to play. For real! You don't even believe me! David. David. - He's not dead. - I'm sorry. I believe you. Oh! What was that? I don't know. Did you see that? There are still people who won't believe they could fly. The sky was once filled with them. - I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume. - Is either of you a paleontologist? No. We're high-school students. Oh. Pity. Well, high-school students, you're on my land and I didn't invite you. But aren't you Stephen Falken? Now, listen carefully. Path. Follow path. Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate. Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run. Wait! Wait. I came because of Joshua. Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone. Confidence is high. Flight profile suggests Soviet backfire bombers. I want a visual confirmation on that. Scramble two F-16s out of Galena. Go to DEFCON 2. Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27. I have negative radar contact. Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft. 27, this is Brass Hat. They're right in front of you! You're almost on top of 'em. Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar and 40 miles visibility. There's nothin' out there, General. Just blue skies. What the hell?! - You haven't been listening. - Yes, I have. I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas. A suitably biblical ending for the place, don't you think? Are you gonna tell them what Joshua's doing? Now, children, come on over here. I'm going to tell you a bedtime story. Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin. Once upon a time, there lived a magnificent race of animals who dominated the world through age after age. They ran and they swam and they fought and they flew. Until suddenly, quite recently, they disappeared. Nature just gave up and started again. We weren't even apes then. We were just these smart little rodents hiding in the rocks. And when we go, nature will start again. With the bees probably. Nature knows when to give up, David. I'm not giving up. If Joshua tricks them into launching an attack, it'll be your fault. My fault? The whole point was to find a way to practice nuclear war without destroying ourselves. To get the computers to learn from mistakes we couldn't afford to make. Except I never could get Joshua to learn the most important lesson. What's that? Futility. That there's a time when you should just give up. What kind of a lesson is that? Did you ever play tic-tac-toe? Yeah. Of course. - But you don't any more? - No. Why? Because it's a boring game. It's always a tie. Exactly. There's no way to win. The game itself is pointless. But back at the war room, they believe you can win a nuclear war. That there can be acceptable losses. So you gave up? Decided to play dead? For security reasons, they graciously arranged my death. Did you know that no land animal with a body weight of over 50lb survived that age? Extinction is part of the natural order. Bullshit! If we're extinguished, it's not natural. It's just stupid! Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead. We're just three miles from a primary target. A millisecond of brilliant light and we're vaporised. Much more fortunate than the millions who'll wander sightless through the smoldering aftermath. We'll be spared the horror of survival. I'm only 17 years old. I'm not ready to die yet. You won't make a simple phone call? If the real Joshua was still alive, your Joshua, - you'd do it, wouldn't you? - Look, we might gain a few years. Perhaps time enough for you to have a son and watch him die. But humanity planning its own destruction. That a phone call won't stop. This is unreal! You don't care about death cos you're already dead. I know a lot about you. I know you weren't always like this. What was the last thing you cared about? You've missed the last ferry. You're welcome to stay. You want to sleep on the floor? Good night. Let's get outta here. Come on. We'll find a boat. There's gotta be a boat. Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs closing on the United States. And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops massing in East Germany. We're monitoring their bombers that are on alert. Yes, sir. Well, that's a load of shit! No, sir. Not you. Yes, sir. We'll be in touch as soon as the information changes. Intelligence reports rumours of a new Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities. It can project a false radar image 600 miles away from the real aircraft. Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows. I think I saw one. What kind of an asshole lives on an island and he doesn't even have a boat? Maybe we can swim for it. How far do you think it is? No. It's two or three miles. At least. Maybe more. - Well, what do you say? Let's go for it. - No. - Come on. - No! I can't swim. You can't swim? No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim. What kind of an asshole grows up in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim? I never got around to it, OK? I always thought there was gonna be plenty of time! I'm sorry. I wish I didn't know about any of this. I wish I was like everybody else in the world. Then tomorrow it would just be over. There wouldn't be any time to be sorry. About anything. Oh, Jesus! I really wanted to learn how to swim. I swear to God I did. Did I tell you that next week I was gonna be on TV? You're kidding? On that aerobics show with some girls from my dad's class. A movie star. Yeah! It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody would have been watching me anyway. I would have. Oh, Jesus! The bastard turned us in! It's all right. Get in. We have a launch detection. We have a Soviet launch detection. BMEWS has confirmed a massive attack. - Missile warning. No malfunction. - Confidence is high. - Cobra Dane, is this an exercise? - This is not an exercise. General, DPS is tracking 300 inbound Soviet ICBMs. - Tell me this is one of your simulations. - It's not, Jack. All right. Flush the bombers. Get the subs in launch mode. We are at DEFCON 1 . DEFCON 1. Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR. Initial attack profile is a full-scale Soviet strike. WOPR is putting our losses at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces. What does WOPR recommend, Mr McKittrick? Full-scale retaliatory strike. I need some machine to tell me that? President's on his way to join Airborne Command. We have to give launch option. - Has he spoken to the premier? - The Russians deny everything. We have a Soviet submarine launch detection. Let's go into a launch mode. Close up the mountain. This is Crystal Palace. We're closing up the mountain. After the gates are closed, nobody gets in or out. Initiate internal power. Generators on and functioning. External power disconnected. Seal off ventilation shafts. Shaft locks sealed. The gate's closed! Is everybody OK? - Are you all right? - Yeah. Run for it! The gate's gonna shut! Come on! Come on! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the goddamn door! Come on! Hurry! They're clear! They're clear! All units confirm weapons targeted and ready. Awaiting launch codes. We are in a launch mode. Major Lem, lock out changes. Roger. Lock out enabled. All right. I'll call you back. Here! I don't know what you think you can do here, Stephen. John! Good to see you! I see the wife still picks your ties. - What has this kid been telling you? - How far has it gone? The president's ready for a counterstrike. That's what we're recommending he do. - It's a bluff, John. Call it off. - No, it's not a bluff. It's real. Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken. Mr Falken, you picked a hell of a day for a visit. General, what you see on these screens up here is a fantasy. A computer-enhanced hallucination. Those blips are not real missiles. They're phantoms. There's nothing to indicate a simulation. Everything's working perfectly. - Does it make any sense? - Does what make any sense? That! Look, I don't have time for a conversation right now. General, are you prepared to destroy the enemy? You betcha! - Do you think they know that? - I believe we've made that clear enough. Then. don't. Tell the president to ride out the attack. Sir, they need a decision. General, do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation, using so many missiles and subs, so that we would have no choice but to totally annihilate them? One minute and 30 seconds to impact. General, you are listening to a machine. Do the world a favour and don't act like one. One minute and 20 seconds to impact. Yes, Mr President. Sir, at this point in time, we cannot positively confirm the inbounds. We have reason to believe they may not exist. Yes, sir. That's affirmative. Yes, sir. I do, too. One minute to impact. Who's first and how soon? Initial impact in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring, 319th at Grand Forks, and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf. 50 seconds to impact. Get me the senior controllers. I wanna talk to 'em myself. All stations, this is Crystal Palace. Stand by for a message from Brass Hat. Acknowledge. Elmendorf Air Force Base Operations. Lieutenant Colonel Bowers. 319th Bomb Wing Operations. Colonel Chase. Colonel, this is Loring Air Force Base. The senior controller isn't here right now. That's all right. Who are you? Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir. This is General Beringer at NORAD. Our current situation. Men, we're currently tracking approximately 2,400 inbound Soviet warheads. But at the moment we cannot confirm this. I repeat, we cannot confirm this. 30 seconds to impact. We're right there with you guys. We've taken all the steps we can. Stand by to launch missiles at my command. Stay on this channel as long as you can. We'll be standing by. 20 seconds to impact. Ten. nine. eight. seven. six. five. four. three. two. one. Impact. This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on? This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on? Anyone there? That's affirmative, sir. Yeah! We're here! - Jesus H Christ! We're still here! - Our boards are showing impact. No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well. All right! All right! All right! All right! Recall the bombers! Stand down the missiles! Joshua, what are you doing? COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away. - This is McKittrick. - Sir, we got a problem. WOPR's not letting me log back on. - I can't get in to stand down the missiles. - Stand by. Paul, this is McKittrick. The WOPR's not letting us back in. I know. No one can get back on. We're trying everything. It's like the entire password file has been wiped out. I tried that! Don't you think I would have tried that? What are those? Those are launch codes. What are they for? Joshua's trying to find the right codes so he can launch the missiles himself. What's happening? The random number generators aren't running. - Got anything? - I'm still looking. I got no idea. It could be coming from anywhere. Sir, you better get on the headset. Yeah? General, the machine has locked us out. It's sending random numbers to the silos. Codes. To launch the missiles. Just unplug the goddamn thing! - Jesus Christ! - That won't work, General. It would interpret a shutdown as the destruction of NORAD. The computers in the silos would carry out their last instructions. They'd launch. - Can't we disarm the missiles? - Over a thousand of them? There's no time. At this rate it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes. Mr McKittrick? After very careful consideration, sir, I have come to the conclusion that your new defense system sucks. I don't have to take that, you pig-eyed sack of shit. I was hoping for something a little better than that from a man of your education. General, it's the president. What do you. What are you gonna tell him? That I'm ordering our bombers back to fail-safe. We might have to go through this thing after all. Yes, sir. He's got one. When he gets all ten, he'll launch the missiles. - Well, can't they get in and stop it? - No. They can't. They've taken out my password. - Well, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. Do you? I told you not to start playing games with that thing. It's games. - Games! - Try it. - John, feed it a tapeworm. - Too risky. It might smash the system. - Did the kid get in the back door? - We took it out. - Invade the deep logic. - We hit a fire wall. If it wants to play a game, then play it. Have it list games. - For Christ's sake! - He's played before. - He can hardly do worse. - Two numbers. I'd piss on a spark plug if I thought it'd do any good. - Let the boy in there, Major. - List games. Chess. Three numbers locked in. Poker. Security system's not gonna let anything through. Global thermonuclear war. Four numbers. Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something. - Come on, kid. Let's go. - No. Try again. - Put the list back up. - We already tried that. - Put it up! - Yes, put it up. - It's not on the list! - What's not on the list? Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere. Tic-tac-toe. You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles. No! No. Five numbers. It's got half the code. One. - Put X in the center square. - I know. - Six up. - There's no way you can win. I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned. - Is there any way to make it play itself? - Yes. Number of players zero. Seven! Come on. Learn, goddamn it. Eight. It must be caught in a loop. It's taking power from the rest of the system. Nine numbers. Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch. Colonel Conley, call SAC. Get me a launch status report. Major Davis, get me the president. How you doin', Colonel? Land lines out of the mountain are dead. I'm trying satellites. - What's it doing? - It's learning. Greetings, Professor Falken. Hello, Joshua. Strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess? Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5. Yes, sir. ^ BugTitleZ ^ The community is outraged that convicted criminal Dr. Light.</i> <i>.has escaped incarceration again, embarking on a deadly spree.</i> <i>Tensions between Bialya and Pokolistan reached new heights.</i> <i>.when Bialya disregarded U.

Up, up and away. Maybe this time they'll learn that crime doesn't pay. Wow, okay. Ha-ha. That's, uh. Wow. It never occurred to me that the S stood for "silly." It wasn't that bad. When have you ever said "crime doesn't pay"? Well, you can take the kid out of the cornfield. Producer said it would be inspirational. And who's profiting from all this so-called inspiration? Proceeds from the cartoon go to charity, Lois. Yes, I've got someone watching. And yes, we have an iron-clad contract. And do you get creative input? Did I mention it all goes to charity? Point is, you have to protect your S. The world is always watching Superman. Well, not always. Oh. Smooth one, farm boy. So close. - Help me! - My God. - The Atomic Skull. - Get somewhere safe. You've gone too far this time, Skull. They were just lawyers. Come closer and we'll talk about it. You've gotten bigger. That genebomb that created me it's still going off. Let go! - Cute. - Why did you attack those people? To draw out the main course, of course. - You used them for bait? - Give me a break. I do what I do, you do what you do. You'll have your front page in 15 minutes, chief. Yes, I'll spell-check. Okay, beat it. Whoa. Here we are, lads and lassie. Makes the old hometown look positively quaint. Mm. Makes me thirsty. They grow them big here, but not as big as Blue Boy. Keep your pants on, Pammy. We don't need you getting all beasty now. - Where do you think he is? - I'll find him. Just stay tight. First impressions, you know. - He don't like you. - I don't like him. So was this justice, Superman? Millions in property damage helpless bystanders killed by a repeat metahuman felon who's now enjoying three square meals a day as a guest of the state. You had the power to end Atomic Skull's criminal career right there permanently. Why didn't you? I'm not anyone's judge and jury, Professor Baxter. Definitely not an executioner. My powers don't put me above the law. A noble sentiment. But are you the Superman that the 21st century needs? Why not use your power to fix the world? Let me reiterate that I'm playing devil's advocate. I'm a huge fan. - Not embarrassing at all. - Your dad? Could do worse. First, I don't believe that the world is broken. Because when we say the world, we're really talking about people. And it's always been my belief that people at their core are good. - Ha. - The grace of mankind is everywhere. You just have to open your eyes. Humanity has a limitless potential for good. My purpose is to help people reach that potential. Tamarev. Tamarev is under attack. What have you people done? How dare you? Pokolistan holds to the treaty. Liar. My people are dying in the streets. No less than they deserve. Limitless potential for good? Good isn't perfect. I have to go.

Flair, mon frère. Who's a good sorcerer? Double pork fried rice for you tonight. You sure know how to make an entrance. Thanks for the assist. Next time, double-check for collateral damage. Came a little close there. - Hello. - You're really tall. Don't mind them, Mr. Superman, sir. Big fans. Paralytic with giddiness. So before anyone does anything embarrassing: Ta. Wait. Who are y.? Where did they come from? Where did they go? What do they want? What's all over that woman's body? These four are the biggest news since Brainiac ate Boston. Someone's gonna break this story and it better be us. It's a given that I am getting the scoop on these newbies, right? Not unless you can type 5000 words a minute. Do not make me unleash my feminine wiles on you, Clark Kent. Too late. For someone who plays fair, you can really suck sometimes. "Telekinetic. Conjured a dragon out of thin air." Outstanding, Kent. - Been on the phone with your source? - Tweeting, actually, sir. Take point on this. Book a flight wherever you need to go. Take Lane if she's still talking to you. Hope you like cold showers, Smallville. You spoke to Superman? What did he say? Are these guys the real deal or what? The jury's still out, Jimmy. He said they're strong. Really strong. But there's something about them. Looks like they did a pretty good job to me. If you boys are done gossiping, some lady in England just went online claiming to know all about Superman's new best friends. - Sorry there's no movie. - Don't try to be cute. You're lucky I'm letting you fly me there. Once we hit the ground, it's every reporter for herself. Unless I get something really juicy. Ah. Learning. I practically raised the lad. He played football in me garden and teased me cats, the rascal. Ha-ha. But a big heart, oh, a big heart. Always helped come harvest. What's his name, Mrs. Munsch? It's not for me to say, is it? Unless you're willing to pay for the exclusive. If she knows anything, I'm the Martian Manhunter. There go all of my fantasies. I'm gonna go knock down some doors. Call me if you get anything. - You too. - We'll see. I'll tell it all. How he saved Churchill from that nasty Doberman. With just his brain. Quite the looker. Your reporter friend. I'm not into the golden oldies. Subspace teleport pods. All the cool HQs have them. So are you stalking me or are you here for the scenery? You never gave me your cell. Had to start somewhere. Quite the detective. Following the guy with the Union Jack tatted to his chest to England? Heh. Come on, I'm just breaking your boots, Superman. Truth is I ramble when I get nervous and I'm in a bit of a twist having a jaw with Superman. Ha. - Let's start with your name. - Manchester Black. Aspiring do-gooder and all-around pain in the ass at your service. You wanna talk? Let's talk. Just not here. Never could stand the smell of the place. Feeding time. Hey, some parsnips and carrots. Good for the skin. - This is inhuman. - Just think what a service you're providing having all your energy sucked into the city's electronic grid. It's almost like you cooked your own supper. Incoming. It's the big guy. Hello, again. Come on, you lot. He doesn't bite. That's a pity. Big fella goes by Coldcast. The Hat's our resident master of hocus-pocus and fortune cookie wordsmith. Your lucky numbers are four, eight, 15. -.and. - I'm Menagerie, but you can call me Pam. At this number. Anytime. Down, girl. Good to meet you all. Thank you again for what you did in Bialya, but we need to talk. Of course. Someone comes sniffing around your tomato so to speak, you need to get a look-see. Due diligence. We're an open book. So if you'll just relax. Sorry. I heard your telepathic shout before. But my mind is protected from anything deeper by a series of psychic blocks. Best I've seen too. Got a few skeletons rattling around up there you don't want out? I'm not looking for your deepest, darkest. Showing is faster than telling. I hate to hear me own voice, believe it or not. Don't believe him. Only thing shuts him up is a soccer game. Football, you uneducated Yank. This is low-level stuff, Supes. Promise. Like telly in HD. - All right. - Apologies in advance for the graphic nature of what you're about to see. Some of us had it rough in the origin department. I'm off, then. See you at dinner. Lucky I give you a roof and a pillow, you worthless squib. You want something to eat? Work it out for yourself. Take the girl with you. Can't stand her mewling. It's a Cinderella story, really. I was the unplanned fifth of five boys left to fend for meself after me mum died giving birth to number six. The only girl. Vera. Ooh. What's wrong, love? I lost my mum! Oh, don't fret, dear. We'll find your mum. The only good thing I had. Brothers had all gone off and wound up dead or in jail where they wound up dead anyway. But Vera, she was special. Did what I could to protect her. But really, she was always taking care of me, till that summer. Plenty of loose wallets in Heaton Park. Not proud of it, but hungry is hungry. - Good day! Let's get ice cream before. - Aah! Thought it was puberty, you know. Headaches. The feeling that my body was turning against me. But it was getting worse by the week. But that day. There's one of them. I couldn't stand. Couldn't run. A damn cripple. If it wasn't for Vera. Sod off, copper. No! Vera! It was a frigging horror show. Me, on my knees. Vera screaming. And I was helpless, praying for it all to stop. Imagine my shock when it did. Goodbye, headaches. Hello, power. After that it's the usual fish tale. Her Majesty's secret service took notice, gave me a bed and taught me about hurting bad people in the name of freedom. Met this lot during a particularly disenfranchising tour in Africa and we decided to make a go of it freelance, like yourself. The rest is current events. Your sister, did she make it? We don't all get happy endings, Superm. Aah! Chester! - What's wrong? - Screams. Lots of screams. Smoke and electrical discharge in both tubes. Evac all trains. Not an accident. Repeat: this is an attack. They've hit us on the east end too. Both ends of the Chunnel are sealed off. This is not right. This should not be happening. Sweet heavenly father. - Captain. - Oh, thank God. We have simultaneous attacks at both openings. The trains are trapped inside, filled to capacity. Flooding has begun to. Melt the blockage to slag and drag the lorries out. No time. The superstructure has been compromised. Collapse is imminent. Can you teleport the passengers? Teleport pod's back home, mate. We're great kicking the snot out of wankers, but this. This is a test of your imagination. How strong are you? - This for real, Ches? - Real as it gets. You got the power he needs? Don't. Just don't ask. <i>Get ready, Black.</i> Like your mum! Hat, you're on deck. Now! Take <i>it</i> up! Damn, he doing it'? Not by himself, sweet thing. If you two are doing pissing about. Got him! Hat! Tell me he's got that thing trained. Not bad for a guy who just kicks the snot out of wankers. Well, I'll be damned. We did it. Looks like you guys are gonna need a name soon. Guess what we found. - Bastards! - Manchester! Who put you up to this? - Easy, Manchester. - Not chatty? Fine. Pokolistani tweaked about England's support of Bialya. You're killing them! Stop! Can't just let them get away with it, though, can we? We won't, but not like that. Why the hell not? No less than they deserve. Call this one a win and save the philosophy for the pub, then? - Definitely. - Hey, hero. Mm. So was it the trashy outfit, or should I start gluing slugs to my face? - Maybe an iguana. - It was a moment. Pam was overexcited. Pam? One team-up and she's Pam. We saved a few hundred people, Lois. What can I say? They're new and. excitable. That excitability better stay one-sided, though you don't exactly sound like a fan. Not sure I am. You're the minority. The net's on fire. - People love these guys. - They didn't see the part where Black almost lobotomized the two Pokolistani terrorists. - That would have sealed it. - What do you mean? I mean some people think terrorists should get what they deserve as slowly and painfully as possible. Is that what you believe? Some days, yeah. I checked with the <i>London</i> Mirror while you were making kissy faces with Lady Furby. They couldn't confirm any of Black's story. - What about the sister? - No birth record. No death certificate. - So he's lying? - Don't know. We need to go deeper. If he did work for the government, his files could be. Okay. Lois. <i>Evening, morning, and afternoon to one and all.</i> <i>.wherever you happen to be.</i> <i>Please forgive this brief but important message.</i> <i>.regarding the safety of the civilized world.</i> How are they doing this? Can you do this? <i>This is</i> a <i>call-out to the shadow cabinets</i> <i>petty dictators and all-around tossers of the world.</i> <i>You're on notice.</i> <i>We're not bound by lines on a map or political alliances.</i> <i>.or governing bodies of any kind.</i> <i>We are our own bosses, and we have a very simple job.</i> <i>There are the good guys, namely us.</i> <i>.and the bad guys, namely anyone who treats anyone else like trash.</i> <i>.to further their petty aims.</i> <i>We turn bad guys into memories.</i> <i>So mind your manners, lads and lasses.</i> <i>.or we'll blow your house down.</i> <i>We're the Elite.</i> <i>You asked for us, world. Now you got us.</i> At least they picked a name. Clark? Ha-ha. All right! Finally someone's got a pair! See, Dad? That's how you do it. No one's gonna pull something with the Elite watching. Everyone likes a shiny new penny, but it doesn't mean that. Lois. Get your coat. That'll give them something to gab about. Viva the Elite! Have another, you git. Meanwhile, back at our secret HQ we continue our chat with the two unluckiest sods on the planet. The slobs at the other end of the Chunnel. Your mates got off easy, and you can as well. Spill your guts, so we don't have to. Pretty please. Guess it's a woman's touch, then. You like picking on those weaker than you. Defenseless. No! No! No! Keep her away from me. The metahumans designated the Elite are not anywhere within the range of our scanners. Their message was downloaded through a post-dimensional channel. I think my phone has an app for that. It means they're hiding between dimensions. Impossible to track. Though we are currently processing 3,500,405 Internet hits on the Elite. How many of them are informational? Zero. How many of them contain the phrase: - "These guys rock"? - 2,800,000. I need something. A location. Do you think the world has moved on to a place where I can't follow? Sir, a spatial disruption matching the Elite's energy signature has been detected over Bialya. Which one of you tin cans is gonna get me back to England? <i>Thank God for the Elite!</i> <i>Finally someone with the power to say what we're all thinking.</i> <i>Not all of us</i> "Might makes right" has never been a productive philosophy. So instead, you'd rather have tea with terrorists. Demitasse with dictators. Of course not, but set aside the rhetoric and analyze what Mr. Black said. <i>He said he's gonna kick some ass!</i> <i>Without the rule of international law, diplomacy, dialogue.</i> Dialogue? There are people you cannot talk to. That's who the Elite are for. What happens when the Elite turn their attentions away from those people. - .and turn them towards you? - Why the hell would they do that? I'm American! We're the good guys. American scum! Today you die. And Bialya falls. Wait. What? They have microwave popcorn in your terror-ass country? Goodnight, ladies. You got terrorist on you. Ck. No worries, mate. It's all over now. Chill a minute. We've had you on a solar energy drip, but your brain's still a wreck. My bad. Didn't see you flying in. Neutrino pulse. It's like an EMP for organics. Stops the electrons in your brain from flowing for a second. Makes everyone go nappy-time unless you are in armor, apparently. Considering the hit you took, it's a bloody miracle you stayed conscious. You. No need to thank us, though cash would be grand. Kidding. How about the tour? It's less boring when you're half in the bag. Even with his ass kicked, it's still a fine ass. Remember who kicked it, baby. Totally flash, eh? She's not just a ship. She's actually the biggest silicone-based bacteria colony in the universe. Well, this universe. Sounds gross, I know, but she's fast as crap through a goose and ducks between dimensions. Complete privacy and gives traffic the finger. Named her Bunny. We think she had the capacity to feel so we jettisoned her emotion nodules a few ticks back. Seemed the humane thing to do. You killed them! Murdered the Pokolistani soldiers. No offense, but someone had to do something while you were playing spastic on the floor. Aww. Hat! Every time we win a battle he gets knackered and pukes all over the place. This isn't a joke. You can't murder people and call yourselves heroes. Why not? Your government does it all the time. Look, Supes, when we take down the baddies, they stay down. - Isn't that better for everyone? - We are not above the law. We have to show the world that there's a better way. - That people can be better. - But that's the problem. They can't. The world's overflowing with sick puppies. Original sin in 36 flavors. I'm not an idiot. I know there are bad men in power. It's not a perfect world, but we can't just throw morality in the garbage. You don't have a clue what it means to live in fear, do you? To wonder why no one can stop the bogeymen who knock down skyscrapers or blow up schools. Well, we do. Human beings do. We understand fear all too well. So now we're wiping the Earth free of scum, and they love us for it. It can't be this way. You know that. I can't allow it. You're welcome for the rescue. Bunny. Black! Um. If this is a problem, I can cut you in 10 percent. As has been repeatedly stated, Ms. Lane, MI5 does not confirm nor deny. Forget it. I got the message loud and clear, Double-No Useless. Just checking in to report nothing from British Intelligence which is a major oxymoron right now. You're barking up the wrong forest. As far as MI5 is concerned, there is no Manchester Black. And are you here to tell me differently, or am I about to get shot in the face? The world needs to know what they're dealing with. Vera? Ches isn't the only one who worked for the queen and had his history wiped. Hope it helps. Why? Because my brother is misguided and angry, but he saved my life. I'd like to save his, if I can. Shall we return to Metropolis, Miss Lane? Knock, knock, skullhead. Yummy time. Almost had some excitement there. The excitement's just starting. Been a lot of talk. Not much of it good. Had to put a slap on Ben Farnsworth on account of he said you looked the fool. I did, Pa. They sucker-punched you. Sucker-teleported, technically. So even Smallville's rooting for the Elite. Well, just the loud, angry and stupid. Come on, it's not that simple. I don't think that I make them feel safe anymore. The way I do things. Clark, when people are scared they have a tendency to hop on a bandwagon before they see who's driving it. But when they wise up, and believe me, they will what matters is that you'll be there for them. Leading by example just like always. Truth, justice and the American way. It ain't broke, so don't fix it. Thanks, Pa. Besides, if those knuckleheads don't quit tugging on your cape you can always kick their self-righteous asses to kingdom come. - Lois? - Home now. Let's get out of here! That's not attractive at all. Finally someone you wouldn't do. Zip it, love birds. Let's show Big Blue how it's done on his home turf. I hope you know that thing goes off during dinner. Yeah, yeah. Dad, that's Central Square. - The Elite are here. - Terrence, wait. Aren't you an ugly biter? He's sending in the B team? I want the boss, not the interns. Let him go! Black. Shield up. I really have to sober up now. What the hell is happening? I think that little rest at Stryker's did me some good. Hat, form a perimeter. Coldcast, can you absorb energy or just project it? Hells yes. If I can get that sucker before he gets me. Oi. You can't boss my team. The man giveth and the man taketh away. You're buggered, mate. Give my regards to Satan then. No. He's going back to Stryker's. Back to jail? Are you daft? This is what happens. More pain, more suffering. - We are not the law. We do not. - Kill him. - Kill him. - I'm sorry. - Do it, Manchester. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Kill it. - Do it. Stop, listen to Superman. - Do it. - Kill the bastard. He. He wouldn't want. It's your fault. You beat him already. - You did it your way and. - And he failed. Is that the world you want? Or should monsters like this get what they deserve? Say it, kid. No. Do it. Listen, I like Superman, sure. But the Elite will kill these murderers and terrorists. What's not to like? The Elite are terrorists. They have allied themselves with Bialya. And perpetrated acts of war against our nation. This will not be tolerated. I've lived in Metropolis my entire life. Superman has always been there for us. But so have those criminals he's put away so many times. Maybe his way doesn't work. Acts of aggression will no longer be tolerated. And not a Superman nor a Manchester Black will stop us from defending our borders. Kill them all and let God sort it out. Superman's done. This is the age of the Elite. It's not fair. Someone else be Superman. Not it. - But you wanted to be Superman. Yeah, but I can't kill you, but you can kill me? That's not fair. - It's the rules. - Sucks. Superman is so beat. <i>Clark. Clark. I called Kansas and Ma said you're not there.</i> <i>So pick up your stupid hologram thing or I'll kick your butt when you get home.</i> - Sweet-talker. - Yeah, <i>well,</i> not really. <i>I made it through those files on the Elite.</i> <i>Mr. Black's back-story is a load of rubbish.</i> <i>Failing to mention his sister is still alive is a good example.</i> <i>And that dear old Dad suffered a massive stroke.</i> <i>.when Chester decided he was due for one.</i> <i>And how Vera's rescue resulted in the deaths of a dozen people.</i> <i>.when he crushed the train that hit her.</i> My God, are you running this in the <i>Planet?</i> <i>I tried.</i> <i>Perry was shut down by British Intelligence before the story left his computer.</i> <i>No one wants to admit they took a narcissistic angry teenager.</i> <i>.and tried to make a Superman out of him.</i> <i>The rest of the team isn't much better.</i> <i>No murders, but criminal records a mile long.</i> <i>All wiped clean when they were recruited.</i> Vera's a sweet kid but she turned into quite the establishment bitch, didn't she? Sorry to barge in, but there was no bell. And magic trumps a giant key every time. I'm going to say this once. Surrender now, face judgment for your crimes or. Stop. There is no "or" in this conversation. Because you don't have the stones to do to us what we'd do to you in a heartbeat. He might have the stones to do me. Pam, I'm handing out ultimatums. Please, keep it in your pants. You probably won't believe this, but I used to love superheroes. But masks are for hiding. Capes are for play. You were the first. The best. But now you're a cliché and you don't fit in anymore. Mad scientists, idiots in underwear, bank robbers, knock yourself out with that lot. But the real work, fixing the world, is ours. Starting tomorrow with Bialya. - I'm shutting you down. - Right. <i>Maybe this time they'll learn that crime doesn't pay.</i> <i>Entering Pokolistan airspace.</i> <i>Capital city in range.</i> <i>Requesting authorization for payload drop.</i> <i>All buildings are active targets. Level the city.</i> <i>Long live Bialya.</i> It ends today. Ends without a single loss of life. Boy, you sure showed us, didn't you? Do I feel mortified? What happens next, Super Gandhi? Next I get the leaders of both Pokolistan and Bialya to sit down and talk in a neutral location. - Don't you think it's a bit late for that? - It's never too late for peace, Black. That's what I'm trying to make you understand. No. No, I mean, it's a bit late because the leaders of Bialya and Pokolistan. - .are dead as a bunch of dead wankers. - What? <i>Well, you know, the opposite of alive.</i> <i>Dead.</i> No one was gonna blink here, Supes. I read their minds. Got all their precious little state secrets. Bottom line is that the war of jackholes was just going to escalate until this dungheap of a region was turned to glass. - No offense. - No. You didn't. The only logical thing to do was to slot the whole megillah and start over. So congratulations, children. Your leaders are all dead. Peace reigns supreme. No! Oh, no. Wait. In a week people will forget these countries ever existed. But they'll never forget the day Superman declared war on their favorite son. Write your wills, say your goodbyes. Tomorrow it's done. <i>While the international community.</i> <i>.has condemned the actions of the Elite.</i> <i>public polls indicate that many feel the conflict between Bialya and Pokolistan.</i> <i>.has been definitively resolved.</i> <i>However, with Superman next on the Elite's list, the question is.</i> Turn it off, please. - When? - Dawn, I guess. They'll like the drama of that. Why do you have to do this? Why can't you call someone else? The Elite didn't take the fight to anyone else. - They chose me. - No, you went after them. They're slaughtering people and laughing about it. Black can punch a hole through a mountain by thinking. The Hat tosses around demons like trained birds and Pam. - They have to be stopped. - I think they can beat you. I'm sorry. But they're willing to go places you won't. And they are so damn strong. I heard a child say that he wanted to be in the Elite when he grows up because it would be fun to kill bad guys. Fun to kill. People have to know that there's another way. They have to see that someone believes in humanity strongly enough to. To die for them? Clark? Show yourselves. Pretty flash entrance, isn't it? Our Bunny's a keeper. Some people have no sense of theater. - I call kneecaps. - Spine. - Other. - Wait. Not here. Please. A last request. Brilliant. We'll patch the game through to interested parties. Want everyone to see it's a fair fight, yes? Crackers. Bunny, darling. Damn you, Clark. Here's a nice slice of pitch to play on. Thank Bunny for the oxygen. Not that you need it, but we mere mortals. Figure you got a speech prepped. I've tried to reason with you. <i>I've tried to show you there's another way.</i> <i>I'm begging you to help me end this without further bloodshed.</i> <i>Stand down and be judged for your crimes.</i> <i>And maybe we can all get out of this in one piece.</i> You're an inconceivable wanker. <i>Pay attention, would-be superheroes, and glorious people of Earth.</i> <i>School's in session.</i> <i>And Professor Chester's gonna learn you how the world will work from this day on.</i> <i>Rule number one: he who has the power makes the rules. Obvious.</i> <i>Rule number two: tough love is a crock of scatters.</i> <i>This isn't about love</i> <i>People don't want babysitters in spandex to spank them when they're bad.</i> <i>They want surgeons to cut out the cancers that festered in us.</i> <i>.and make sure they never come back.</i> <i>Dr. Black, at your service.</i> Wait for it, kids. Rule number three: no more capes.</i> <i>As this ends quicker than any of you ever imagined, take heed.</i> <i>Blue Boy is the first.</i> <i>But if any of his costumed cronies rise up to avenge their fallen dream.</i> <i>you'll get worse, I promise. The dream is over.</i> Viva reality. No witty retort? Oh, wait. You're in the middle of a seizure. Sorry, mate. I can't read your mind but I sure as hell can muck about with your brain. All those capillaries, like little tubes of concrete. But still vulnerable. It's funny, isn't it? A life of truth, justice and the American, military, capitalist way. In the end, you die on the moon, wondering if your bowels will let go. And tomorrow, the world will go on like nothing happened. Dragged kicking and screaming to a better day. Ta, mate. - They didn't really. - I mean, it's Superman. There, look. How is it that no matter how badly you massacre one of these thong-and-blanket types some shred of their unmentionables still survives the blast? I did my best, boss. At least you got a trophy out of it. Strewth. Right, who else has business to perform on this shroud before we hang it up? - I, for one, should like to scrub my. - I finally get it. <i>Thank you.</i> No frigging way. Cool it, Hat. Coldcast? Nothing could have. That was like 15 suns exploding in his face. I made the mistake of treating you people like people. No sonar. Can't smell him either. Scorched air. But now I understand better. I'm getting a tight sphincter here, Chester. Shut your gob. I understand now what the world wants. What it needs. Ow! Something bit me. - Bit you? - Pam! - Do something. - Do what? He's poisoned the zoo. The buggers want out. He is supposed to be dead. - She's not breathing. Damn it, Chester. - She's dead? Bugger me. He's playing it our way. Leave her. Blister the land and flush him out. I can't. Not after a blast like that. Call the ship and get Pam to sick bay. Guys. The world needs people in charge who are willing to put the animals down. - Is.? Is that Superman? - Not anymore. - Pam! - She's dead. Let her go. Hang tight. Everyone knows Superman can't do magic. Don't let him separate us. Here's a little ancient Chinese secret. How? He's shielded by magic. That wind is clocking in at 500 miles a minute. His body may not be taking any hits but his lungs just collapsed from the vacuum. Do something. Find his brain and shut it down. He thought this through. - He's been playing us this whole time. - Chester. He killed Pam and the Hat. Get With it. Bunny, get us out of here. What the hell are you doing? Pam is still up there. - We can't just. - He won't do anything here. Not with the sheep around us. Bunny, get ready to port again. The second he shows his S, I'm gonna flatten this whole city. Chester, wait. Holy sh. Where did he go? Where did he freaking go? Orbit. He went into orbit at Mach seven. If you had super-hearing, any second you'd hear the pop. Oh, no. You crazy son of a bitch. You killed my team. Your team of killers. Now guess what. They won't be killing anyone else. See? I finally bought what you've been selling. You bloody psychopath! How does it feel, Black? How does it feel to be deconstructed? To be the victim? To watch your dreams die? Let me show you, you self-righteous hypocrite. Heat vision? You can barely stand, let alone fry my face. I'm not aiming at your face. You're not dying. I'm thinking it but why can't I feel my power? I scanned your brain for abnormalities. And when I found one I out it out. - What? - Heat vision. Focused through your pupils like a scalpel. Instant lobotomy. This isn't you. You don't do this. I do now. No! <i>It doesn't have to be that way, Superman.</i> <i>You taught us that.</i> No. He taught you that he's no better than the rest of us. You all saw. Everyone on Earth saw what you did to us. <i>And they know you're no better. There's nothing special about you.</i> <i>Yes, they did see.</i> They saw the ugliness of violence as a solution and it frightened them. It frightened me too when I decided to cross that line and do what you do. It's so easy. Anger, vengeance. Luckily, I'm not you. And I never will be. You killed my team! Look at this place! Chester. I thought you were supposed to be the sharp one. Boys. - Hell of a performance. - To be fair, I had some help. Your sister, to start. Her files were very thorough. Especially regarding the idiosyncrasies of your brain. But I knew they wouldn't be enough. You're right about me. I would never put civilians in harm's way. <i>I Won '1' kill.</i> <i>But you would.</i> So <i>I made sure I had backup</i> <i>As for your people.</i> <i>.they're fine.</i> <i>Nursing headaches I don't even wanna think about.</i> <i>But very much alive as they're stripped of their powers.</i> <i>.and prepped for transport to a supermax prison.</i> That's why I had to let you knock me around for so long. I didn't have a nifty teleporter. Bunny, you rotten clot, get me out of. But I do now. You'd be surprised how fast Bunny agreed to help me when one of the super-bots promised to return her to her home dimension. You.? You think that's it? It's not over, you poncy twit. If you think I'll just go to jail and rot, you're living in a dream world! Good. Dreams save us. Dreams lift us up and transform us into something better. And on my soul, I swear that until my dream of a world where dignity, honor and justice are the reality we all share I'll never stop fighting. Ever. Olsen, get the crowd reactions. Perry loves crowds. You ever scare me like that again, I'll kill you. If I ever scare me like that again, it's a deal. Can we go so I can kiss you now? TIMECRIMES Clara! Clara! Clara! - Didn't you hear me calling you? - You called me? - Yeah. You didn't hear me? - No. - This was the one you wanted, right? - Yeah. - And the fertilizer? - Up there. Put it there. - You'll assemble it out here? - Sure. Time flies here. I'm going upstairs to lie down. Telephone! What? What did you say? Yes? Hello? Who is this? <i>This is a restricted terminal.</i> <i>Record your message</i> <i>or give your access code.</i> Right. We got a call from this number. - What were you saying? - Nothing. The phone rang. Who was it? They didn't say anything. But I got some weird machine. - Probably the workers. - Today's Saturday. Or a neighbor. Is today Saturday? I thought it was Friday. When's the painter coming? Nobody has our phone number. Then what's the point of having a phone? Look at him. Too weak even to argue. - You haven't slept. - Yes, I have. "Yes, I have." "Yes, I have." - Shit. - What? It's still recording. This is all set. You'll never get it through the door. Sure I will. Otherwise we'll put it out here. It's not worth worrying about. - What do you feel like for dinner? - I don't know. What have we got? I don't know. There's almost nothing left. There must be a store still open in town. How about roast chicken? I'm not taking the car again. Come on, I'll clean up the kitchen. I don't want to take the car. Come on. I'll go if the table fits through the door. Okay. If it doesn't, I'll go. I promise. Seriously. No changing your mind later. - I know you. - Move, move, move! - What? - I can't see. Sorry. There's something up there. In a bush. Let me see. - Look. - Where? There, by the bush. There's a clearing on the left. - I can't see anything. - Here. - Where? - Give it here! Here. You win. What? The table doesn't fit in the bedroom. I'd rather lose the bet than have you against me. - Give me the keys. - Okay. Never bring this up again. Not even once, okay? Yeah. What's wrong? What do you mean? The keys. Here. See you later. I'll leave them by the door. Okay. Hello? Hello! Hello! Hello? Is anybody there? <i>Who is this?</i> - Listen. <i>- Who are you?</i> <i>This is private property.</i> <i>Where did you get that walkie-talkie?</i> I need help. A man is after me. He's trying to kill me. I jumped the fence and came in. <i>What did you say?</i> <i>You jumped the fence?</i> <i>What hapened?</i> He stabbed me in the arm and I ran here. The door was closed, but. - What was that? <i>- What?</i> It sounded like. <i>I just heard thunder.</i> <i>You mean that?</i> Yeah. I think so. <i>Okay, listen. Stay calm.</i> <i>I'm in another building.</i> <i>I'll be right over. Stay there.</i> Okay, thanks. Hello? <i>- Yes?</i> <i>- Did you say something?</i> <i>One question. Is the man after you</i> <i>wearing a bandage?</i> Yeah, a pink one. <i>- I can see him.</i> <i>- Where? Where is he?</i> <i>Far from the house, don't worry.</i> <i>There are surveillance cameras</i> <i>everywhere.</i> <i>I have the monitors in front of me.</i> <i>He jumped the fence.</i> Is he coming this way? Please, call the police. <i>I'll call them right now.</i> <i>Hold on.</i> <i>Stay where you are.</i> <i>Hello?</i> <i>- Hello?</i> <i>- Well? How did it go?</i> <i>I don't get it.</i> What's wrong? <i>I can't get an outside line.</i> You don't have a cell? <i>There's no coverage out here.</i> - What is he doing? <i>- Walking.</i> - In this direction? <i>- Yeah.</i> I broke a window. If he sees it, he'll know I'm here. What should I do? <i>I don't know. Where are you?</i> In a laboratory. I blocked the door. <i>No, come up here.</i> <i>It's much safer.</i> Where? <i>I'm in a silo at the edge</i> <i>of the property, up the hill.</i> And? <i>There's a door down the hall</i> <i>on the right.</i> <i>Come up the hill. He's coming from</i> <i>the other side of the house.</i> <i>I don't think he'll see you.</i> <i>If he goes inside, he'll find you.</i> <i>He's getting closer.</i> <i>Get outof there.</i> <i>Get out of there!</i> - I'm coming out. <i>- Okay.</i> <i>That was me.</i> <i>Come up the path.</i> <i>Stay on it.</i> <i>Hurry up. The sooner you get here,</i> <i>the sooner I can turn off</i> <i>the lights.</i> <i>He shouldn't see them.</i> Where is he? <i>He's approaching the house.</i> What's he doing? <i>Keep quiet, I'll guide you.</i> <i>He's checking the windows.</i> <i>He's seen the broken one.</i> - Is he going in? <i>- Kee quiet.</i> <i>He's going around the house.</i> <i>He's seen the ath.</i> <i>Hold on.</i> <i>Impossible. I've lost the signal</i> <i>from one of the cameras.</i> <i>I've lost another.</i> <i>Shit I can't see anything!</i> <i>I don't know where he is! Run!</i> Please, turn off the lights. I see something on up there. Is that you? <i>That's me, it's okay.</i> I hear the car. <i>It's him! He's coming up!</i> Can he get in? No, it's okay. - Can you lock that? - No. - Shit, let's go. - There's nowhere else to go. We're safe here. What is all this? You can hide in there. What? What is that? Look. I can lower the hatch to hide you. Does this door have a lock? Is there another door? Another way out? Can we turn off these damn lights? He'll never think to look in there. What about you? I have to lower the hatch from here. I'll activate it and get in with you. Okay. Come on! Who are you? What? Who are you? What? - What did you do to me? - I don't know what you mean. You said you'd get in with me. I said what? You've been here before, right? Was the tank full of white liquid? We've seen each other before, right? The liquid you're soaked in. That tank is still a prototype. It's actually a. - This was the one you wanted, right? - Yeah. - And the fertilizer? - Up there. Put it there. You went back in time. - Where are you going? - Home, to call the police. - No, wait. - Stay away from me. For God's sake, you can't go home. What? You're already home. Want another look? - They're doing exactly what. - Listen. Today is September 16, 2006. No, it can't be. - What day did you think it was? - I don't know. But I got in the tank on the 16th, and it was night already. So you only traveled. a little while. What do you mean, a little while? You're not listening. You traveled in time. Into the past. That's why you can see yourself. You traveled to a past where you're still at home, in your garden. So what do I do now? How did you get in the machine? How did I get in? Look, I was at home, okay? - And suddenly. - Don't tell me. It's better not to know details. You found me at the silo - and I asked you to get in the tank. - Yeah, but you. Okay. If that's how it was, everything is solved. Why? - All you have to do is wait. - Wait. for what? There's nobody else here. Come on. What was your name again? - Hector. - Hector, right. Who is the man in my home? He's you. - He's me? - Technically you're the same person. He's like your reflection. You're looking in the mirror. Only this mirror shows what you were doing roughly about an hour ago. But that man is in my home. And he'll leave, in the same way you did. How can I put this? Come on. Excuse me. You want one? No. Sit over there. This is you. This arrow moves forward from past to future, okay? But at this point you enter the tank and travel an hour and a half into the past. To here. You become a sort of Hector 2. The one at your house - is Hector 1. - Hector 1? Hector 1, your reflection in the mirror, remember? Look, you're here. You're seeing yourself, but there's only one arrow. For how long? Your reflection will last up to here. This is what we'll do: <i>Hide here. I'll configure the tank</i> <i>in the basement</i> <i>and go up to the silo.</i> <i>I'll have it ready</i> <i>and I'll wait for nightfall.</i> <i>Hector 1 will show up,</i> <i>I'll get him into the machine</i> <i>and send him to the past.</i> So here's the deal. What deal? I'll bring everything back to normal and you won't tell anyone about any of this. I shouldn't be here. The center is normally closed weekends, but I felt like staying. I'm going up. <i>Yes?</i> <i>Hello?</i> <i>Who is this?</i> What the fuck? <i>This is a restricted terminal.</i> <i>Record your message</i> <i>or give your access code.</i> <i>Right. We got a call</i> <i>from this number.</i> <i>- What were you saying?</i> <i>- Nothing. The phone rang.</i> <i>Who was it?</i> <i>They didn't say anything.</i> <i>But I got some weird machine.</i> <i>- Probably the workers.</i> - What is this? You called your house? <i>- Is today Saturday?</i> - I say lay low and you call your house? - You can't stop me. <i>- Then what's the point</i> <i>of having a phone?</i> - Did you talk to yourself? - No. I called my house. that's it. Did you talk to yourself? My wife is at home with that. <i>Look at him.</i> <i>Too weak to even argue.</i> <i>- You haven't slept.</i> <i>- Yes, I have.</i> <i>"Yes, I have."</i> <i>"Yes, I have."</i> Do you remember getting that call? At your house? Do you remember answering? Yes. Before I left, I got a call from myself. Then everything still fits, right? I'm going up to the silo. The tank needs to be filled. I can't put a chain on you, or lock you in the basement. But if you alter events and stop Hector 1 from getting in the tank, it will be the end of your life as you know it. <i>Shit. It's still recording.</i> And your wife will still prefer being with him to being with you. Can't I just go home and explain? There are rooms upstairs. I'll come and get you when it's over. I. Fuck! <i>Who is that man</i> <i>in my home?</i> <i>He's you.</i> <i>But that man</i> <i>is in my home.</i> <i>And he'll leave,</i> <i>in the same way you did.</i> <i>Technically you're the same person.</i> <i>He's like your reflection.</i> <i>Can't I just go home and explain?</i> <i>It will be the end of your life</i> <i>as you know it.</i> <i>What am I supposed to do now?</i> My God. What the fuck? Hello? Are you all right? I'm okay. What happened to your face? I got hit. Nothing serious. Don't move. I'll be right back. I'll call an ambulance. What are you doing? I said to stay put. No, I'm okay. There. Shit, no signal. I'll find a phone. Wait for me here. No, don't go! Please. I'm a little dizzy. You want some water? Yes, thank you. I'd be right back. The sooner an ambulance comes, the better. Hold on, it'll come unraveled. Here, let me. I was just cutting my neighbor's hair. That way it won't fall off. I'll get help. Wait for me here, okay? Wait. What's wrong? I don't know how to explain this. I need your help. - Excuse me? - Come on. Have a seat and don't move until an ambulance comes. Please. What are you doing? Let's go, that way. Why? - Please, that way. - No. I need your help with something. Come on, follow me. Let's go back to the road. That way. No, keep going forward. I have to go. That way. Please. Trust me. Don't worry, it's okay. I need you to do something for me. - I'll explain later. - Why not now? It's not easy to explain. No! Shit! Do as I say. Turn your head to the right. No, my right. Now lower your head a bit. A bit more. Don't look at me. Now bite your left thumb. Slowly. Like you're thinking of something. Now pull up your shirt. Take it off. Now! Slowly. I'm sorry. Whatever I ask you to do, I won't hurt you. You can put it back on. We're done. You see? Can I go now? Hide there, by that rock. Crouch there. Take off your pants. You can put them back on later. Go on. - What are you doing? - I have to stand up, don't I? Okay, hand them over. Should I take off anything else? No, it's okay. Give them to me. Are you sure? Yeah. Give me your pants. What about my panties? No, I didn't say that. Hello? No, fuck! <i>I need you to do something for me.</i> <i>I'll explain later.</i> <i>Why not now?</i> <i>It's not easy to explain.</i> Hello! No, wait! Hey! Please open the door! Listen to me a second! I was in the garden. This is my house, you know. and suddenly I saw you with my. I was far away. For God's sake, don't call anybody! Hey! No, wait! Wait! Clara! Bye! - I'll have them by the door. - Okay. <i>- It sounded like..</i> <i>- I just heard thunder. You mean that?</i> <i>Yeah. I think so.</i> <i>Okay, listen. Stay calm.</i> <i>I'm in another building.</i> <i>I'll be right over. Stay there.</i> <i>Okay, thanks.</i> Hello? <i>Yes?</i> <i>- This is Hector 2.</i> <i>- What?</i> The second one. Keep your voice down. Hector might hear us. <i>Okay, okay.</i> He left the walkie-talkie on the table in the basement. <i>All right.</i> I'm the one wearing the bandage. Get him up to the silo. Make up something. I'll show up in a car. <i>- Make up something?</i> <i>- Hello?</i> <i>- Yes?</i> <i>- Did you say something?</i> <i>One second.</i> <i>Is the man after you</i> <i>wearing a bandage?</i> <i>Yeah, a pink one.</i> He'll never think to look for you in there. I have to lower the hatch from here. I'll activate it and get in with you. Come on! The man with the bandage, the pink mummy! I admit it should have occurred to me when. Come on. Where are you going? To the house. You need to be examined. You're the first vertebrate to ever travel in time. That bull about surveillance cameras could have used more preparation. Surveillance cameras! We could use some. - What are you doing? - I have to get back in! What? Something went wrong! So you want to fix it now? Forget it! - Listen to me! - We'll talk at the house! - Come here! - Forget it! No way! What are you doing? Come back or I'll tear it apart. Go right ahead. I'll wait for you at the house. What are you doing, trying to ruin me? After all I. What else has to happen before you realize the implications? I have to do it. It's not going to happen. The tank won't work. Don't lie to me. Your trip used up all the energy. It's not easily renewable. It'll have to be next week, I don't know. Sorry. There was something there. There was, but it's not. You took it out? No. Where is it? I threw it away outside. It's one of the batteries. We can't do anything without it. Come on. This machine doesn't solve problems. In fact, it creates them. I just need a head start on the other two. I need a previous moment to be able to. Look, I had activated the machine seconds before you appeared inside it. It was turned off before that. You can't materialize inside a machine if it's off. It's impossible. Seconds before? How many seconds before? Maybe 30 or 40. You'd have a 30 or 40-second head start. It's absurd. If you travel into the past and alter events and stop Hector 1 from getting in the tank, there will be 3 of you. Which will likely cause a chain reaction of events beyond your control. I won't interfere. Hector 2 will chase Hector 1 into the tank, like he did before. My change won't affect his plan. Then there will be 2 of you. You and Hector 2. Hector 2 comes up here, I follow him and finish him off. We'd be one again. You have no idea what you're saying. Hold on. Why did you throw that thing away? I can't let you use the machine again. I'm sorry, I. No, what I mean is. You took out the battery before I said anything, right? Well, yeah. Before I showed up. Because I imagined. One moment. How did you know I'd want to use the machine again? You knew it all along. Are you tricking me again? You're tricking me again. Tell me. Please, don't make matters worse. You knew what would happen. Why? Because Hector 3 told me. Hector 3? Hector 3. The third one. You're kidding me. You weren't the first to appear in the tank. You were the second. <i>The first had appeared earlier.</i> <i>He threatened me.</i> <i>He made me act surprised</i> <i>to see you.</i> <i>He made me go along with it.</i> He appeared earlier? How much earlier? Maybe 30 or 40 seconds. But. He left right after you. I never found out what he wanted. You've been deceiving me this whole time. After leaving the two of you, I went up to the silo to prepare for Hector 1's arrival <i>when suddenly I got a buzz</i> <i>on the walkie.</i> <i>It was Hector 1,</i> <i>calling from the house.</i> <i>No, much earlier. It was daytime.</i> <i>It was Hector 3.</i> Hello? <i>- This is Hector 3.</i> <i>- Who?</i> <i>The last one. Listen to me.</i> <i>I'm very sorry.</i> What happened? <i>I'm afraid everyone will know</i> <i>what we did.</i> <i>He seemed out of it, like something</i> <i>horrible had happened.</i> <i>He told me everything</i> <i>that would happen.</i> That you'd show up here, trying to go back to the past. And he didn't say why, but he said to stop you at all costs. You'll be Hector 3 if you go through with it. What I say won't stop you. Happy? Wait a minute. You mean the 2nd trip I'm about to take was already made? Apparently you couldn't solve your little problem. You told me yourself it failed. It makes no sense. Wait. You say Hector 3 called you from his walkie. Yeah. You mean. from this walkie. Yeah. Shine the light on it. Over there! I think this is yours. All I ask is think it over. Hector, what happened? I have no choice. Calm down and listen to me. I'm from the future. Your machine works. - Where? - Listen to me. - How? - Listen to me! Or everyone will know you turned it on without authorization. Right now there are 3 of me. You're going to help me get rid of the other two. Hector 2 is about to come out of the tank. Help him get Hector 1 into the tank. Hector 2? But. He'll explain it to you. - But. - Stand there. Calm him down. I have to reach the house before you. Make sure he doesn't see me. I have to get rid of him, you got it? Calm him down. Ask him who he is. - But who's Hector 1? - Go! Shit! You're here! Keep it down, he might hear you. I need a remote for the gate. - In the desk. - Not for the white car. The others. There aren't any others. Then another car. There's a truck. The deal's still on, right? When you get rid of them you won't say anything, right? - I told him. - I know, but he won't listen. He'll leave at some point. What are you going to do? Go after him. Hello? <i>Hello?</i> - This is Hector 3. <i>- Who?</i> The last one. Listen to me. - I'm very sorry. <i>- What happened?</i> I'm afraid everyone will know what we did. Looks like you bet on the wrong horse. I'm a failure. <i>Hector.</i> <i>Hector?</i> <i>Where are you?</i> Why did you have to turn on the machine? <i>I don't know.</i> <i>They won't turn it on</i> <i>for another 6 months.</i> <i>I won't be authorized to be there.</i> <i>I guess..</i> You wanted to take a closer look beforehand, right? If you want to keep your job and your life as you know it, keep the guy with the bandage out of the tank at all costs. <i>Why?</i> At least that way somebody will be there to smack you. What happened? I think we're both running from the same person. He won't find us here. - His face is bandaged. - Yeah. He's up there. He won't come down here. Have you got a telephone? No. Sit here. Wake up! There's a house nearby. Can you get up? There it is. Come on. No, we shouldn't go in that house. Careful. Hello? Wait here, I'll go check. Hector! What happened to you? Nothing. There's someone outside. Across the garden. He broke the fence. A man with his face covered. I ran down here to hide and I heard someone on the stairs. There's somebody in the house. I called the police. What's wrong? My God. Hello? Who is that? Come with me. Hector. Hide in there until I say. Tell me what's happening! No matter what you hear, don't come out. Don't interfere. Please! Listen. That guy is crazy. He saw you from far away and went nuts. You have to hide from him. You have to fool him. Come on. There's an attic upstairs. When I say "now," run upstairs and lock the door behind you. You're beautiful. Now. No, wait! Hey! Please open the door! Listen to me a second! I was in the garden. This is my house, you know. And suddenly I saw you with my. I was far away. For God's sake, don't call anybody! What happened? Hector, what's going on? Relax. Hector. It's okay. We still have a while before it starts raining. Chris, what is it? l love you so much. Don't you love me anymore? l've made progress, and l recognize that. But my wife, who l can't even convince to come here. Anything can set her off. lt could be the phone ringing, something on the news, something online, going shopping maybe. A commemorative T-shirt in the window. ltjust puts her right back in that place, and it's like all my progress - ripped away. And l'm right back there with her. l feel totally the opposite. l see the TV and l see the lnternet and l see those T-shirts and l feel nothing. The more l see the images, the less l feel, the less l believe that it's real. l mean, l think l'm supposed to feel something by now. Don't you think so? Linda, this is Chris Kelvin. l'm returning your call. l have two times available this week; 7am on Tuesday or 6:15pm on Thursday. You can leave a message if either ofthose times are good for you. Thank you. Well, l know that's not true. Because l know you, and l know it's not true. Good. l'm glad. All right. Let's pick this up on Wednesday. Can l help you? We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin. Chris. l can't imagine what you must be thinking, getting a message like this. l apologize if it seems melodramatic, but you are the only person l can trust in the situation. l need your help. l need you to come to Solaris, Chris. l don't know how to describe what we are experiencing up here. We can't even agree amongst ourselves what is happening, or what to do about it. l suppose the most obvious solution would be to leave. But none of us want to. That's why you're getting this bizarre request. l told the crew that your background and experiences made you the ideal candidate for this job. Don't worry. l didn't elaborate. But it's true. So, anyway. l hope you will come to Solaris, Chris. l think you need to. You will see what l mean. l wish l could be more specific about all ofthis, but, you know. People are listening. You can imagine the distress Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA. Why not send in the security force? We did. We lost contact as they were approaching Solaris. They haven't returned. There must be some sort of on-board Al system. They shut it down. The company was hoping to solve this problem without involving a civilian. Obviously these are extreme circumstances. Some preparation is involved but you shouldn't have any trouble. The flight itself is fully automated. You'll be asleep most ofthe trip. We feel confident that ifyou board the ship, you can negotiate their safe return. ls that what everybody wants? Of course. Find the probability of F. OK, stop. Go back. Snow. Kelvin, is it? Yeah. Kelvin. Right. Oh, man. Sorry about that, Kelvin. Names, you know, just. For some reason. Yeah. Well, you wanna come in? l'm fine. Whose blood is that, leading to the lab? Yeah. Blood. How 'bout that? Katarn. He, um. Security forces showed up and he just took off, and they put a hole in his pot. What happened to Gibarian? lt was a suicide. Who found him? l found him. What happened to Rhys? Yeah, now, Rhys. We don't know, because the thing is, he kind of disappeared. - Disappeared? - Disappeared. - How did he disappear? - Exactly. Don't know. We do know that he's not on the ship, and that's all we know. Where's Dr Gordon? Dr Gordon. She is in her room, and Dr Gordon won't let you in her room. Can you tell me what's happening here? l could tell you what's happening, but l don't know ifthat'd really tell you what's happening. l just wanna talk to you. You have to give me your word you won't try to come in. All right. Well? - What happened to Gibarian? - Didn't you talk to Snow? - l wanted to hear your version. - There isn't any version. He killed himself. Why haven't you come home? What happened here? What did you find? - Who are you representing? - l'm the last effort to recover this mission, before they abandon this ship and everyone on board. Until it starts happening to you, there's really no point in discussing it. - Who else is here? - Who else is here? l saw a boy. Gibarian's son. - Michael. - How is that possible? l think that's why you're here. l want a formal interview with you and Gordon. l'll need your help with her. Yeah. All right. How much sleep do you need, Kelvin? - How much sleep? - Yeah. - How long can you go without sleep? - Depends. Well, when you do go to sleep, l find l sleep much better with the door locked. l was with the project when it was still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA. l was trained in physics. l was sent here to assess the economic potential of Solaris. Whether or not it was a viable commercial property or possible energy source. l was still compiling data when this shit started happening. Did you run any tests on the food, air, water? l checked it 50 times. There are no signs of contaminants or psychotropic compounds. How about you? How are you doing? Depression. Along with bouts of hypomania and primary insomnia. Suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, shock, fatigue, denial. - Not unusual, given the circumstances. - l know. All right. Now, what can you tell me about what's happening here? Just that l want it to stop, but l want to stop it. lf l can stop it that means l'm smarter than it is. You know you can go home, walk away from all ofthis. l can guarantee it. Yeah. The thing is. Man, l would kill to go back there. l'd kill. But Gordon? Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know? But l'll see what l can do. We take off into the cosmos. Ready for anything - solitude, hardship, exhaustion. Death. We're proud of ourselves. But when you think about it, our enthusiasm's a sham. We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors. So, anyway. How's the spawn? Oh, good. He cries and shits in his pants every two hours. l know the feeling. When are you leaving? - We've been postponed again. - l didn't hear that. Nobody knows yet. The governments are looking for a buyer. l wish we could tell people what's happening. You can tell me. l'm a doctor. Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris, the most interesting thing is it. Well, it seems to be reacting. Almost like it knows it's being observed. We can't explain it. Are you listening to me? Chris? - So anyway. - So anyway. Sorry. Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit tricky but l guess she's worthwhile. Maybe she needs a shrink. Don't we all? Don't blow it. You start. l did. Really? All right, l'm gonna resist the impulse to ask you about the doorknob. - Do you always resist your impulses? - Not always. Try poetry. ''And death shall have no dominion.'' Thomas. lt's not a very happy poem, though. Well, you didn't seem very happy when l saw you on the train. l wasn't. And tonight? lt's early. Goddammit. l'm awake. Yes. How are you here? How do you mean? Where do you think you are? Where do you think you are right now? At home. Where is home? With you, where we live. And do you remember being anywhere else with me? Being together anywhere else? - Our apartment. - Describe it. lt's dark. lt's very very dark. And there are no paintings on the wall. No pictures anywhere. No pictures on the fridge, even, which l always thought was a bit strange. Do you remember where we first saw each other? On a train. Chris. l'm so happy to see you. l love you so much. Don't you love me anymore? l have to check out something with the crew. No! Don't leave me! Why? - Why? - l don't know. lt's OK. Why are you sitting over there? Can l come and sit with you? Hey. What was that? Yeah. How 'bout that? Still workin' on that. Where's your visitor? l don't know. Stopped appearing. - Who's your visitor? - My brother. Who was it? My wife. Dead? So what was her name? Will she come back? Do you want her to? - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. lt's crap. - Only one way to find out. You can submit it to someone and see ifthey publish it. That's not an indication of anything. So no one else's opinion counts except for yours? - Yeah. - That's insane. - That's insane. - l like it. Brings out the red in my eyes. Did you show it to your father? - Yeah. - And? - And he liked it. - What'd he say? - He said he liked it. - Well. He's a man who doesn't pass out compliments very easily. That's something. - What's that tell you? - Can we talk about something else? Please? All right. When do you wanna get hitched? Every time l bring it up you make ajoke about it, and. l know. l'm sorry. lt's just. lt's so difficult for me. Still? ls it something that l'm not doing? No. That's not the issue at all. Because, you know, ifyou keep putting this off, then in 15 or 20 years l'm just gonna stop asking. Well, l've got ages, then. So apart from the poem that you quoted to me the night that we met. The night that you were hitting on me. Oh, l don't think so. What's your favorite poem? My favorite Dylan Thomas poem? Well, there's the. There's the. Well, there's the one he's most famous for, which starts: - ''There was a young man from Nantucket.'' - l knew it. l just. l'm not marrying you. Oh, you're marrying me. Would we have to invite anyone else? There should be witnesses. Otherwise nobody'd believe us. When l was little l had this imaginary friend called Mikashelli, who used to live under the wallpaper in the corner ofthe room. l used to go and visit. l had a very intense relationship. l was an only child. As you know. That was like my sibling. That was the person l used to have battles with and fights with and everything. What happened progressively over the next few years is that my mother stopped communicating with me. She only communicated with me as Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters, and we didn't have conversations anymore. Admittedly, she was certifiable. But that was a strange way to grow up. You know, you're with the right man. l so know that. That's what's great. Cos, man. Rheya. lt's me. l don't remember that. When did you get that? l got itjust before l came here. - Was l with you? - No. l don't actually remember anything. l only remember you. Have l been ill? Sort of. And we've been apart? - Yes. - For how long? A few years. - Were you alone? - Yes. Was that difficult? lt was easier than being with someone else. Did you think about me? Yes. What is that, out there? Solaris. Oh, my God, yes. l can't remember how l got here. Did l come here with you? - l don't know how you got here. - What do you mean? l woke up and you were here. So l wasn't here yesterday? No. Right. Getting dressed? People will notice tonight. lfyou're not there, Rheya, people will notice. l can put up with all of it, you know? The mood swings, the restlessness, changing jobs every three months, all of it. What l can't put up with is you hiding from me. Why do you do that? Do you wanna be here? Cos l need help. l can't do this. l can't continue to do this on my own. The idea of God was dreamed up by man. A silly animal with a small brain. Even the limits that we put on it are human limits. - lt designs, it creates. - No, l'm talking about a higher intelligence. No, hold it. You're talking about something else - a man in a white beard. Ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. Aren't we all? Rheya, given all the elements ofthe known universe and enough time, our existence is inevitable. lt's no more mysterious than trees or sharks. We're a mathematical probability, and that's all. How do you explain that of all the creatures on this planet, only we are conscious of our own mortality? You can't explain that. That doesn't mean there's a God. Maybe religion has been bred into us. The pope is a wonderful woman. - Excuse me. - A nihilistic shrink. ls there a school? Not yet. You see? He's funny, at least. Where you been? Away from those fucking people. They're my friends. Yeah. Chris, l've got to talk to you. What's wrong? l don't understand what's happening. And if l do understand what's happening then l don't think l can handle it. What do you mean? l mean. l'm not the person l remember. Or at least l'm not sure l am. l do remember things, but l don't remember being there. l don't remember experiencing those things. l'm really really trying to understand. And these. These strange thoughts keep coming into my head, and l don't know where they're coming from, and l'm scared. And l don't know what's happening. - What do you think's happening? - You need rest. - No. - Take that. You don't understand. Because l don't think that l can live with this. l don't understand what is happening now. This - l remember this. l have a memory of it. But l don't. l don't remember seeing it. l don't remember being there. Rheya, it's fatigue. lt's brought on by stress. lt's fatigue. That's why you take this. Right. Yeah. No, it is. You'll be fine. l'll talk to Gordon and Snow. We'll go back to Earth. And you're gonna be fine. - l'm coming right back. - Right. - Are you gonna be all right here? - Yeah. This door locks from the inside. - Yeah. - You'll be perfectly safe in here. Yeah. You sure you're gonna be all right? You keep asking me that, actually. Yes. Yeah. l'm fine. Stay here. l was so worried, man. About this guy. But then you show up, and l'm even more worried about you. Particularly after the first. When you sent the first one away. Yeah, you were pretty. You deserved to be as freaked out as you were. She can never know anything about that. Ever. You understand? No. l wonder ifthey can get pregnant. Where are you going? - l can't be here. - What? You should have told me. - lt wouldn't have made any difference. - Really? Chris, l had to. Obviously l had to. You know that about me. l had no idea you'd react like this. Listen. Listen to me. What's changed? l didn't even know you wanted one. Why would l want one? Why would l want a child, or anything that would bring life into this house? - No, Chris. No. - Stop it. No, Chris, you don't understand. You have to understand. l had no idea you felt like that. l won't make it without you. - Then you won't make it. - Chris, no, please. - Let go of me! - No! No! Oh, my God. Oh, no. You wanna change Gordon's mind. What if Gordon and your wife, your very nice wife. She's nice, right? Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice. They get together, right? Cos l'm thinkin' ''women'', right? Right now we got woman and woman, right? lfwe get women together on the same team and all that shit, what happens? You know what happens. All kinds of shit you can't explain happens. But good shit, you know? Mysterious, but good. Usually very good. Things get solved, you know? That's my plan, you know? What do you think? l'll have to think about that. ''And death shall have no dominion.'' ''Dead men naked, they shall be one With the man in the wind and the west moon.'' ''When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone, They shall have stars at elbow and foot.'' ''Though they go mad they shall be sane.'' ''Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again.'' ''Though lovers be lost love shall not.'' ''And death shall have no dominion.'' You found me. l came back for you. l came back that day. l'm sorry. All right. Enough hypothesizing. The visitors. Are they or are they not made of subatomic particles? Subatomic particles. l'm not sure. What do you think? l think probably. Stabilized by what? Guess. l don't know. Maybe a Higgs field. So ifwe created a negative Higgs field and bombarded them with Higgs antibosons they might disintegrate? Maybe. You know, it would take a lot of power. Shut down all the noncritical ship functions. This is just a theory, you know? We could be wrong. - Let's find out. - We'll take the findings back to Earth. What ifthey follow us back? What ifwhat's happening here happened on Earth on a mass scale? Don't you see that as a problem? l think it's a serious mistake to assume it's benign. lt's driving us crazy so it can watch us kill each other. ls that really why you think they're here? Given its resources it could have done anything, including destroy us. Meet me in the lab in an hour. - l won't let you. - How you gonna stop us? - How you gonna stop me taking her back? - Shall we pick up the other one on the way? Shouldn't be too hard. We could chart its course. Only take a day or so. Chris, what's she talking about? - Nothing. - Her oxygen might have run out. Maybe they don't need any. Chris, what are they talking about? You didn't tell her? Tell me what? - You came before. - He got rid ofyou. You what? l sent you away. lnto space. Oh, my God. No. Rheya. Don't touch me. Rheya, l didn't understand. Rheya. - Don't. - No. Don't. What were you trying to accomplish with that, exactly? Kelvin. lt is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one ofthem. You're being manipulated. lf she were ugly, you wouldn't want her around. That's why she's not ugly. She's a mirror that reflects part ofyour mind. You provide the formula. - She's alive. - She is not human. Try to understand that, ifyou can understand anything. What about your visitor? The one you're so ready to destroy without hesitation? Who is it? What is it? Does it feel? Can it touch? Does it speak? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. Your wife is dead. How do you know? How can you be definitive about a construct you do not understand? She's a copy. A facsimile. And she's seducing you all over again. You're sick. We are not taking her back with us. Leave the light off. You think you're dreaming me. You're not Gibarian. No? Who am l, then? - A puppet. - And you're not? Well, maybe you're my puppet. But like all puppets, you think you're actually human. That's the puppet's dream - being human. Why did you kill yourself? lt seemed like a good idea at the time. Now l think l made a mistake. - What about your son? - That's not my son. My son is on Earth. And that's not your wife. They are part of Solaris. Remember that. What does Solaris want from us? Why do you think it has to want something? This is why you have to leave. lfyou keep thinking there is a solution, you'll die here. l can't leave her. l'll figure it out. Do you understand what l'm trying to tell you? There are no answers. Only choices. Rheya? Gordon! - What happened? - She drank liquid oxygen. She's dead. No. l never get used to them. These resurrections. Oh, no. No. Why'd you do that? Rheya? Don't call me that. There are two components. A high-energy proton accelerator and a matter phase modulator. By adjusting the tuning frequency l get an enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz and an almost pure beam at 160GHz. l used it on mine. What happens? They disappear, back where they came from. lt's what she wants. l won't let her do it. She'll come to me when you're asleep. Then l won't sleep. Don't you see? l came from your memory of her. That's the problem. l'm not a whole person. ln your memory you get to control everything. So even ifyou remember something wrong, l am predetermined to carry it out. l'm suicidal because that's how you remember me. My voice sounds the way it does because that's how you remember it. l don't believe that we're predetermined to relive our past. l think that we can choose to do it differently. The day l left and you said you wouldn't make it, l didn't hear you because l was angry. This is my chance to undo that mistake. And l need you to help me. But am l really Rheya? l don't know anymore. All l see is you. All l see is you. lt created me. And yet l can't communicate with it. lt must hear me, though. lt must know what's happening to me. And you and l, we would have to have some kind of an arrangement, some kind of unspoken understanding that l'm not really a human being. No, Rheya. Chris. l wish you would just let them use the device on me. And then you can go back to Earth and you can tell everybody all about Solaris. No. lt's the only solution that makes any sense. We could never have a life together on Earth, Chris. You know that. lt would be impossible. And this? What kind of life is this? Trapped here. lt's not a life. l don't know what to call it. lt's what we have. lt's enough for me. You need to rest. You're going to make yourself ill. - l don't care. - Just lie down for a moment. Please, Chris. You have to rest. You know l'm not human so l don't understand what you're afraid of. Of course you can use the device. lt's not murder. You said that yourself. You're the one who had the idea in the first place. Chris doesn't trust me. Chris, don't blame Gordon. lt's not her fault. l begged her to do it. lt's better this way. l found the suicide note. l went through your things. The page torn from the book of poems. And l realized l'm not her. l'm not Rheya. l know you loved me, though. l know that. l felt that. And l love you. l wish we could just live inside that feeling forever. Maybe there's a place where we can. But l know it's not on Earth. And it's not on this ship. That's all l can say right now. - You killed her. - Not her. lt. - lt's murder. - Kelvin, she begged me. lt wasn't painful. - She'll be back. - No. - Why would you let her do it? - Kelvin! lt's not human. Whatever it is, it's not human, and l'm threatened by that. And l wanna win. l want humans to win. Whose side are you on? - What are you doing? - Putting the Al back online. l'm going home. Gordon. - l knew it. - How long you think he's been dead? Hard to say because ofthe cold. He attacked me. There l am. Somehow, there l am. And l couldn't tell you how l'm there, or who l am or what's going on. But before l can get to that, what's this over here? Comin' at me. What are you tryin' to do? Oh, l see. You're tryin' to kill me. Yeah, confusing. l'll tell you somethin' confusing. Bingo, there you are, and my welcoming committee dropped his knife and it's good night. And, by the way, after all that l find this, whoever this. l get my first good look and it happens to be. l survive the first 30 seconds ofthis life, whatever you call it, by killing someone. And by killing someone who happens to be me. See, most people. l would think most people in this position would be, like ''This. Ah.'' ''l don't know.'' However, this is at least. This is an incredible opportunity. This is. What ifthis is a gift? l'm a gift. Hey. l say we use the Higgs device on him. l don't think you really have time. Why would you say that? Well, you know, ever since we used the famous Higgs device, Solaris started taking on mass exponentially. You might have noticed how we're a lot closer to it. That would be because everything within its gravitational field - it's pulling it in. And, yeah, sorry. By the way, the Higgs device also drained the fuel cell reactors. Can l make a suggestion? l mean, this is. You can do what you want, but l would just lock me in here really tight and take the Athena back. Wear your seat belt. Switch to internal power. Start fuel cell operational diagnostic. Service check on LGA. Point and calibrate high-beam antenna. Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby. Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers. Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines. Earth. Even the word sounded strange to me now. Unfamiliar. How long had l been gone? How long had l been back? Did it matter? l tried to find the rhythm ofthe world where l used to live. l followed the current. l was silent and attentive. l made a conscious effort to smile, nod, stand, and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth. l studied these gestures until they became reflexes again. But l was haunted by the idea that l remembered her wrong. That somehow l was wrong about everything. Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby. Disengage coupling interlocks and all docking couplers. Vent and seal all main engine propellant lines. Rheya! Rheya? Chris? Am l alive or dead? We don't have to think like that anymore. We're together now. Everything we've done is forgiven. Everything. Visiontext Subtitles: Rob Colling US ENGLlSH <i> The strange, almost unbelievable, story of Robert Scott Carey</i> <i>began on a very ordinary summer day.</i> <i>I know this story better than anyone because I am Robert Scott Carey.</i> - This is the way to spend a vacation. - Mm-hmm. I'm thirsty. Mmm! That sun feels good. - I'm thirsty. - Interesting. - A cold bottle of beer'd taste fine. - Why don't you get it? - Me? - Mm-hm. - I'm on vacation. All week. - Well, so am I, my friend. - Louise? - Hmm? - I think we should get married. - We've been married six years. - Really? - Mm-hm. Seems like six minutes. I am not gonna get you that beer. I provided the boat. You provide the beer. - Your brother provided the boat. - I'll make you a deal. - What? - You get the beer, I'll get the dinner. - How's that? - OK, you got yourself a deal. To the galley, wench. Fetch me a flagon of beer. I'm sorry, Captain, but we're out of flagons. It'll have to be a can. Out of flagons? How are we to make the Philippines? We're not going, sir. We're going home at the end of the week. Mutiny. - Make 'em cold! - Like ice. - Scott, what was that? - I don't know. Some kind of mist. Look at your chest. <i>But then, on an equally ordinary day, six months later.</i> - Morning, Joe. - Morning, Mrs Carey. - Looks like a nice day, huh? - See you tomorrow. Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Come on, Butch. That's a boy. There you go. - Scott? Scott, are you dressed yet? - I'll be right there. All right. - Lou? - Yes, dear? You sure you got the right pants from the cleaners? Just a second. - You asked that yesterday morning. - They still don't fit. - They still too loose? - The cuffs are draggin'. They do look kinda big. I dunno what that cleaner's doing, but tell him to cut it out. You're just losing weight. It's very becoming, so don't complain. - You want one or two eggs? - One. One? Now that's why your pants don't fit. - Lou? - Yeah? Hey, the shirt doesn't fit either. It's your shirt. It's got your monogram on it. - What's that supposed. - Eat your breakfast and forget it. I know a lot of people who'd like to lose weight. What's your secret? - Maybe it's the cooking around here. - Well, thanks a lot. Drink yourjuice. - Lou, do me a favour. - What, honey? - Pick up a bathroom scale today. - All right. Still get five foot eleven inches, Mr Carey. - I've been six foot one since I was 17. - Mm-hm. - What's the weight? - Still 174 and a quarter pounds. I don't understand it. That's a loss of almost ten pounds. I told you, you're probably overworking yourself. You told me that when you overwork you get nervous and lose weight. But I've never lost that much weight. Besides, I haven't been particularly nervous lately. Not eating wouldn't make me lose height, would it? Oh, I very much doubt if you've been losing height, Mr Carey. Why don't you put your things on? You told me that you've been six foot one since you were 17 years old. That's right. How many physical examinations have you had since then? Oh, the draft board, the Navy, a life insurance physical. That's not too many. It's possible there might have been errors made on all of them as regards your height. It often happens. A number of things could cause such errors. If you stood erect, you'd measure out as taller than you actually are. Or if your height was taken in the morning, you'd measure out as taller. Why's that? Because people decrease in height during the day. See, the body weight compresses the spinal discs, the bone joints and so on. - I see. Two inches, Doctor? - I wouldn't worry about it, Mr Carey. As far as I can see you're in perfect health. Likely lost a little weight due to an insufficient diet but. People don't get shorter, Mr Carey. They just don't get shorter. What'd Charlie think about your idea for the ad? Huh? Oh, he thinks it has possibilities. - Well? - Four pounds. - Up or down? - Down. That does it, my boy. You're gonna start taking vitamins. I'm gonna get you so fat on ice cream and cake you'll think you're living in a child's paradise. - I don't think that's gonna fix it. - Then we'll see a doctor. - You're due for a checkup anyway. - I've already seen a doctor. - When? - A week ago. Well, honey, why didn't you say something about it? Come here, Louise. - Kiss me. - You think that's gonna fix it, huh? You didn't have to stretch. You used to stand on your toes. What? In your stocking feet? - I'm getting smaller, Lou. Every day. - Well, that's silly, honey. People just don't get smaller. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. We'll go back to the doctor tomorrow. I'm sure he's got a pill for it. Don't worry, Butch. Everything's gonna be all right. Go to bed. Well, that's the last of them, Mr Carey. - This has been a long week, Dr Bramson. - I must have worn out your machine. I needed two full sets of pictures spaced several days apart. I had to compare them before I. Before I could be sure. Sure of what, Doctor? What is it? Relax, Doctor, you can't tell me anything I haven't imagined. You are getting smaller. I. I don't profess to understand it, Mr Carey. There's no medical precedent for what's happening to you. I simply know that you're getting smaller. The X-rays prove it beyond any doubt. But that's impossible. That's what we've always believed, Mrs Carey. I'm gonna send you to the California Medical Research Institute. If there is an explanation for your phenomenon, why. They'll find it. <i>Then began a series of intensive tests.</i> <i>I drank a barium solution, and stood behind a fluoroscope screen.</i> <i>They gave me radioactive iodine.</i> <i>And an examination with a Geiger counter.</i> <i>I had electrodes fastened to my head.</i> <i>Water restriction tests, protein bond tests, eye tests, blood cultures,</i> <i>X- rays and more X-rays. Tests, endless tests.</i> <i>And then one day in the third week the final examination.</i> <i>A paper chromatography test.</i> Now don't be despondent, Mr Carey. At least we've found out what is happening to you. Gradual loss of nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus. - This test may tell us why. - I hope so. I think the strip should be dry by now. We should find phospholipid, amino acids, cholesterol, creatinine, and protein. These are the elements most commonly found on the strip. Mm-hm. Wait a minute. This one doesn't belong. It certainly doesn't belong. Here, take a look. Our analysis shows that it's a rearrangement of the molecular structure of the cells in your body. - You mean like a cancer? - No. No, more like an anti-cancer, causing a diminution of all the organs. Then you know what's causing me to get smaller. We think we do, Mr Carey. That's why I asked you here. Now I want you to tell me something. Have you ever been accidentally exposed to any kind of germ spray? In particular, an insecticide, a great deal of it. - Insecticide? - Exactly. Has there ever been a time when you were so exposed? Do you remember that day I told you about the truck? Yes, about two months ago. I was on my way to the store through an alley. As I was walking a truck turned in. It was spraying trees. - Is that what's causing me to. - No, that was only the beginning. You see, something happened to that insecticide after it was in your system. Something fantastic and unprecedented. Something which, in layman's terms, so affected the insecticide that from a mildly virulent germ spray it created deadly chemical reversal of the growth process. Have you been exposed to any radioactivity in the past six months? Oh, no, of course not. I don't come in contact with anything like that. I. Scott, wait a minute. That day we were on the boat. - The boat? - Charlie's boat. Remember? Well, yes, I remember. The mist. That mist! You want me to drive, honey? No, I'm all right. Louise. I want you to start thinking about us. Our marriage. Some awful things might happen. There's a limit to your obligation. Oh now, wait a minute. Look, I love you. Don't you know that? You love Scott Carey. He has a size and a shape and a way of thinking. - All that's changing now. - Not a darn thing's changed. When I married you I meant what I said. And as long as you've got this wedding ring on, you've got me. Come on now, let's go home. The truth is, I just lost the Bannister account. You know how big that account was. Probably 40 per cent of my income. It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more. You've done everything that a brother possibly could do. Look, I don't like to say this but. There have been reporters over at the plant. Looks like somebody at the medical centre talked about you. I told them there was nothing in it, but one of the reporters stayed behind. He was from the American Press Syndicate. He said they might pay for the story. If it's true. Scott, the story's going to break anyway eventually. So whether you make them pay or not, they're going to make the most of it. - So make them pay. - No, Charlie. Well, think about it. All right. I'll think about it. <i>But really, was there any choice?</i> <i>We owed a great deal of money and I had nojob.</i> <i>There was no choice. None at all.</i> <i>And so I became famous.</i> <i> And still Robert Scott Carey,</i> <i>known to a nation as The Incredible Shrinking Man, keeps getting smaller.</i> <i>How long will this phenomenon continue?</i> I want to apply for an unlisted line please. This is a special case. My name is Louise Carey, my hus. Carey. C-A-R-E-Y. Now look, we've got to have an unlisted line. That's all there is to it. I. I talked to you yesterday. - Has he come out yet? - How big is he now? - Have you seen him? - He's got to come out sometime. What's the television truck doing here? <i>We return you now to Magic Melody.</i> Yes, thank you very much. Scott? Scott, I've. - I've cancelled our phone. - What? I said, I've cancelled our phone. They're gonna try to get us an unlisted line sometime next week. - What do you mean, they're gonna try? - They're just gonna try. A lot of people are waiting for unlisted lines. Didn't you tell them who you're married to? Scott Carey, the shrinking freak? - Don't. - Use your influence. - I'm a big man! I'm famous! - Please don't. Those reporters out there. Why don't you tell them about it? Give 'em a new angle for their. for their papers! Or will I save it for my book? Yeah, that's what I'll do. A whole chapter devoted to telephones and one more joke for the worid to laugh at! Scott, people know. They realise. They're not laughing at you. - They're not? - No. Why not? It's funny, isn't it? But it is. See how funny I am? The child that looks like a man. Go on, laugh, Louise. Be like everyone else. It's all right. Well, why can't you look at me? Look at me! Don't, Scott. Will they just let us alone? Will they just let us alone? Lou, honey, I'm sorry. I must be losing my mind, talking to you like this. No, honey. I'm all right. - I know what you must be suffering. - Do you? Yes, I guess it's been a nightmare for you too. Maybe we've forgotten how to hope. But, Scott, there's so much to hope for. Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin. Sure. Lou, let's get out of this place before we both go crazy. Somewhere where nobody can find us. All right, Scott. I'll. I'll look for something. And try. Try not to worry. No, I'll let the doctors worry. I'm two days behind on my book. <i>October 17th. Height: 36-and-a-half inches.</i> <i>Weight: 52 pounds.</i> <i>We haven't been able to find a new house and there still is no privacy,</i> <i>no relief, and no word from the medical centre.</i> <i>- I fear that what life remains to me.</i> Hello? Yes, this is Carey. - Louise! - Yes, Scott? The antitoxin, they found it. Oh, Scott. Are you sure? Dr Silver wants us down there. Right away! There's something you both must understand. We're working with unknown factors. Nothing is guaranteed. We're 50 per cent sure this will be effective. The other 50 per cent, we'll just have to pray. How long before we'll know? Mr Carey will remain here under observation for a week. We should have the answer by then. - Are you ready? - Ready. Weight: 52 pounds. Height: 36-and-a-half inches. What was last week's reading? Weight: 52 pounds. Height: 36-and-a-half inches. No change, Doctor. It's all over, Scott. You're gonna be all right. How long will it take, Dr Silver? To be normal again? Put on your robe now. That'll be all, Miss Maltby. Mr Carey, we seem to have checked the degenerative process of your disease. We've won that much. At this moment the growth capacity of your body is as limited as any adult's. Whether or not you grow again is another question. To help you, we face a whole new set of problems. Then I'll spend the rest of my life. like this? Mr Carey, I assure you, we'll go on working. Every day we'll push our knowledge further until one day we might have the whole answer. Thank you, Doctor. <i>My relationships with the worid had ceased with everyone.</i> <i>.except my wife.</i> <i>And I knew I was driving Lou from me.</i> <i>But burning inside, adding its own hideous pressure to everything else,</i> <i>was my desperate need for her.</i> - You want the paper, Scott? - No. No thank you. Well I think I'll turn in. Come on. - Coming to bed? - Yeah, soon. - Well, good night then. - Good night, Louise. <i>I felt puny and absurd. A ludicrous midget.</i> <i>Easy enough to talk of soul and spirit and essential worth.</i> <i>But not when you're three feet tall.</i> <i>I loathed myself. Our home, the caricature my life with Lou had become.</i> <i>I had to get out. I had to get away.</i> <i>For the first time since it happened, I ran into the night. Alone.</i> Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Here it is, folks! The greatest show in the Midwest! Come on in and see all the freaks and curiosities! See Dolly Dumpling, the fat lady! She weighs 840 pounds! When she sits down, she shakes and quivers like a bowl ofjelly on a cold and frosty morning! See Flamo! Flamo, the Fire-eater! Here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days! You will remember these sights for the rest of your natural life! Time for the big show. I would like you to meet a few of the exhibits here on the platform. First we have Tiny Tina! Here she is. 36-and-a-half inches of feminine pulchritude. You'll see freaks and curiosities assembled from every part of the globe! The most unusual aberrations assembled under this tent! Contrived by a tricky Mother Nature! Here they are in all their glory! This exhibit is not only entertaining, it's educating. Hello. - Mind if I sit down? - No. Please do. - Don't be late, Clarice. - I won't. - Hi. - Hi. - Pass me the sugar, huh? - Oh, sure. I haven't seen you here before. You with the carnival? Oh, no, I. No. - Just visiting then, huh? - Yeah. - I'm Clarice Bruce. - My name's Scott Carey. Hi, Scott. Scott Carey? I'm sorry, maybe you don't want any company. No, don't go. I want you to stay. Talk to me. - All right. - How do you live with it, Miss Bruce? - What do you do? - I was born a midget. It's the way I grew up. And now it's happened to you and that's different. Different? That's another way of saying alone, isn't it? Oh, but you're not alone now. Still, it must be hard to forget the way things were. Yeah, I'd like to burn it out of my mind. Maybe the best way to begin is to start thinking about the future. - A future? In a worid of giants? - I've lived with them all my life. Oh, Scott, for people like you and me the worid can be a wonderful place. The sky is as blue as it is for the giants. The friends are as warm. - I wish I could believe that. - You've got to believe that. - Don't you? - Yeah. Give me time, Clarice. I'll learn. - Oh! I'll be late for my show! - Oh, look, can I see you again? - Mmm. If you like. - I would. You know, Scott? You're taller than I am. May I? Thank you. <i>That night I got a grip on life again. I went back to work on my book.</i> <i>It absorbed me completely.</i> <i>I was telling the worid of my experience.</i> <i>And with the telling, it became easier.</i> - I think it's just fine, Scott. - Do you really think so? I'm not much of a writer. Just tryin' to tell what it's like. You don't know what it's meant to me, meeting you. - Someone who understands. - But you're so much better now. Thanks to you. Aw, not to me. Yourself. You just stopped running, that's all. All I know is I can wake up in the morning and want to live again. Actually want to live. It's a funny thing. Sometimes I begin to think it's the worid that's changed. - I'm the normal one - That sounds like a good thing. Everybody out of step but you and me. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. We can talk about another chapter. What is it, Scott? Two weeks ago I was taller than you. You said so yourself. - Yes, I remember, but. - Well can't you see? - I'm shorter now. - Oh, Scott. It's starting again. It's starting. It's starting again! Scott? Scott? - Scott? Are you in there? - Do you have to make such a racket? - I told you what happens in there! - I'm sorry, Scott. I try to be careful. - Are you going out? - Yes, for a little while. - Where? - Just to the corner. To the store. - You'll come right back? - Well of course I will. Why don't you try to get some rest? Dr Silver wants to see you tomorrow. All right, go ahead. Be sure the doors are locked! <i>Every day it was worse. Every day a little smaller.</i> <i>And every day I became more tyrannical,</i> <i>more monstrous in my domination of Louise.</i> <i>Heaven knows how she lived through those weeks.</i> <i>Only I had the power to release her.</i> <i>If I could find the courage to end my wretched existence.</i> <i>But each day I thought, "perhaps tomorrow".</i> <i>Tomorrow the doctors will save me.</i> Scott! No. No. No. Oh, Scott. Scott. .drew deafening applause when he announced that if elected he will do everything in his power to reduce taxes. From Los Ángeles today, a tragic story. The passing of Robert Scott Carey. The report of the death of the so-called Shrinking Man comes from his brother. Carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat, a former pet in the Carey home. He was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine. <i>Thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive</i> <i>lasted until the the very end. A man whose fantastic story</i> <i>was known to virtually every man, woman and child in the civilised worid.</i> - Mr Carey? - Yes? - You may go up. She wants to see you. - Is she all right? The doctor gave her a heavy sedative but it's hardly working at all. - I see. - I'll get that prescription filled. - I'll be back in a minute. - Fine. <i>My return to consciousness was a plunge into a new level of pain.</i> <i>I realised I had fallen into a box.</i> <i>Its walls enclosed me like some gigantic pit.</i> <i>I had to escape out of the box.</i> <i>Somehow I had to reach Louise, to survive.</i> <i>The stairs stretched above me as far as I could see.</i> <i>Cliff rising upon cliff.</i> <i>I knew I could never scale them.</i> Louise! Louise! The cellar! Look in the cellar! Louise! Please look for me! Louise! <i>Eventually Louise would come to the cellar.</i> <i>Until then, I had to keep myself alive</i> <i>with whatever resources I could discover in my basement universe. And in myself.</i> <i>The cellar floor stretched before me like some vast primeval plain.</i> <i>Empty of life. Littered with the relics of a vanished race.</i> <i>No desert island castaway ever faced so bleak a prospect.</i> <i>I had discovered a water supply, and even a dwelling place.</i> <i>Now, the search for food.</i> <i>I knew my ill-fitting clothes were unsuited</i> <i>to the exertions that lay before me.</i> - You can't stay here, Louise. Not now. - I. I don't know, Charlie. - I don't know what I wanna do. - Lou, let me help you. You can stay with us, but get out of here. If I could just be sure. Charlie, maybe he's hurt someplace. - Maybe he's lost. - We've looked everywhere. He's dead. I'm his own brother. I wouldn't say a thing like that if I wasn't sure. - You saw the cat. - All right, all right. Charlie, have you thought how horrible it must have been? I just keep thinking that he needed me and I wasn't there. - I wasn't there. - Louise. You've got to get it out of your mind. I'll never get it out of my mind. I'll talk to the real estate people. <i>I never doubted that sometime Louise would come.</i> <i>I couldn't allow myself to doubt.</i> <i>I had only to exist. To search out enough food to sustain me.</i> <i>I was driven by hunger.</i> <i>And also by the horrible thought that without nourishment,</i> <i>the shrinking process was quickening.</i> <i>I was weak and faint.</i> <i>Yet I knew, in order to exist, I must eat.</i> <i>The food was still a long climb ahead of me.</i> <i>But now, stretching endlessly before me, I found a deep abyss.</i> <i>It was only a box and the space between.</i> <i>Yet to me it was the Grand Canyon and the Mammoth Caves combined.</i> <i>Deep, dark, mysterious and dangerous.</i> <i>There was no possible way to cross,</i> <i>no matter how inventive, how resourceful I thought myself.</i> <i>This time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if I must meet defeat.</i> <i>Suddenly I saw an opportunity,</i> <i>if I could move the stick to the other side.</i> <i>I cursed myself. If only I were a little bigger. A little stronger.</i> <i>I realised there was just this one chance,</i> <i>and I had no choice, I had to take it.</i> <i>If I could leap from the paint stick and reach the other side.</i> <i>But there was no time to think. Only to act.</i> <i>My prison.</i> <i>Almost as far as I could see, a grave, friendless area of space and time.</i> <i>And I resolved that as Man had dominated the worid of the sun,</i> <i>so I would dominate my worid.</i> <i>In my hunt for food, I had become the hunted.</i> <i>This time I survived.</i> <i>But I was no longer alone in my universe. I had an enemy.</i> <i>The most terrifying ever beheld by human eyes.</i> Charlie, there's a trunk I'd like to take with me if you don't mind. - It's in the basement. I'll show you. - I'll put these in the car first. Oh, all right. Oh no, it's flooded! The water heater. I better have a look. - Oh, this is terrible. - I'll turn the water off. Louise! Look for me! Louise! Charlie! Charlie, I'm here! Charlie! Louise! The water! Here in the water! Charlie! I smell gas. Is that pilot off? I'll turn it off. Listen to me! Louise! Louise! Hear me! Please! Please! - Can you fix it? - There. I'll get a plumber down here tomorrow. Charlie! - Where's your drain? - It's there. It must be clogged. Charlie! Look for me! - Is that the trunk, Louise? - Oh, yes, but don't bother about it. - It's so wet. I'll pick it up later. - It's OK. I want you packed and out of this house tonight. - Is that everything, Louise? - Yes, that's everything. <i>I still had my weapons. With these bits of metal I was a man again.</i> <i>If I was to die, it would not be as a helpless insect</i> <i>in thejaws of the spider monster.</i> <i>A strange calm possessed me.</i> <i>I thought more clearly than I had ever thought before,</i> <i>as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light.</i> <i>I recognised that part of my illness was rooted in hunger,</i> <i>and I remembered the food on the shelf. The cake threaded with spider web.</i> <i>I no longer felt hatred for the spider.</i> <i>Like myself, it struggled blindly for the means to live.</i> <i>If I was to fight it, if I was to win the food,</i> <i>then it must be now while strength remained,</i> <i>while I was still of sufficient size to scale the wall.</i> <i>It was not decision that drove me to the crate, but reflex,</i> <i>as instinctive as the spider's.</i> <i>My legs trembled. Not with fear, but weakness.</i> <i>Yet somehow I felt within myself a new source of power.</i> <i>A giant strength, urging me to the death struggle.</i> <i>My enemy seemed immortal.</i> <i>More than a spider, it was every unknown terror in the worid,</i> <i>every fear fused into one hideous night-black horror.</i> <i>Still, whatever else had happened, my brain was a man's brain.</i> <i>My intelligence still a man's intelligence.</i> <i>An idea came to me. The scissors.</i> <i>Too heavy for me to employ as a weapon, they might have another use.</i> <i>If I could impale the monster with my hook,</i> <i>fastened by a line to the scissors, then push the scissors off the ledge.</i> <i>Whatever the risk, it was worth a try.</i> <i>I knew, sooner or later, it would come charging down that web,</i> <i>skimming out blackly toward me. One of us had to die.</i> Come on down! Come on, you devil, I'm waiting for you! Come on! <i>This was the prize I had won.</i> <i>I approached it in an ecstasy of elation.</i> <i>I had conquered. I lived.</i> <i>But even as I touched the dry, flaking crumbs of nourishment</i> <i>it was as if my body had ceased to exist.</i> <i>There was no hunger. No longer the terrible fear of shrinking.</i> <i>Again I had the sensation of instinct.</i> <i>Of each movement, each thought tuned to some great directing force.</i> <i>I was continuing to shrink, to become.</i> <i>What? The infinitesimal?</i> <i>What was I?</i> <i>Still a human being?</i> <i>Or was I the man of the future?</i> <i>If there were other bursts of radiation,</i> <i>other clouds drifting across seas and continents,</i> <i>would other beings follow me into this vast new worid?</i> <i>So close, the infinitesimal and the infinite.</i> <i>But suddenly I knew they were really the two ends of the same concept.</i> <i>The unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet,</i> <i>like the closing of a gigantic circle.</i> <i>I looked up,</i> <i>as if somehow I would grasp the heavens, the universe,</i> <i>worids beyond number. God's silver tapestry spread across the night.</i> <i>And in that moment I knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite.</i> <i>I had thought in terms of Man's own limited dimension.</i> <i>I had presumed upon Nature.</i> <i>That existence begins and ends is Man's conception, not Nature's.</i> <i>And I felt my body dwindling,</i> <i>melting, becoming nothing.</i> <i>My fears melted away and in their place came acceptance.</i> <i>All this vast majesty of creation, it had to mean something.</i> <i>And then I meant something too.</i> <i>Yes, smaller than the smallest, I meant something too.</i> <i>To God, there is no zero.</i> <i>I still exist.</i> Break through the shining clouds, and fly away (fly away) As a panorama spreads itself throughout my being! The earth, having been kicked in the face, gets angry (angry)! And makes one of its volcanoes explode! If, within the thawed polar ice, There is a dinosaur, then I want to train him to balance atop a ball. CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA No matter what may happen, I feel as though nothing can bother me, CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA However hard your chest pounds, the Genki Dama will roar! CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA The emptier you head is, the more room there is to pack with dreams, CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z, today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai. Sparking! Piccolo-san! Say, Piccolo-san, yoo-hoo! Guess what! Haiya Dragon has started dancing along as I whistle! See? Piccolo-san, watch this! Here we go, Haiya Dragon! Cut it out. I said cut that out! I'm sorry, Piccolo-san, for interrupting your meditation. Papa, how about it? It'll collide with Earth this afternoon. It's going to hit Earth!? How about we blow it to pieces with missiles? Well, you see now, I'm reading life signs from on that planet. Life signs? He means it's inhabited. So, what should we do about this? These images are from a computer simulation. In the event that it collides with Earth, we will be finished. The Earth will be destroyed! There is no time left for any of us! In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen. Sayonara! This is terrible! I'm not going to just sit quietly and watch it happen. After all, I. After all, I wanted to get married sometime! I just can't seem to attain his state of mind. Kuririn, we just need change its orbit. We can't destroy it. I know, Bulma-san made it a point to tell me there were life signs coming from that planet. It's here! If Son-kun and Kuririn don't succeed, Earth is finished. We're counting on you, Goku and Kuririn! Goku-sa. Father. What!? We're done for! We're. alive. Looks like we got off with a near miss. The other planet exploded. Father and Kuririn-san did it! What's that? Let's go see. What is it? Looks like something's happening. What's going on? Henceforth, this planet belongs to Slugg-sama, king of all the universe. This galactic system is also under his rule. What was that? King of all the universe, he says. What are they, nuts? What does all this mean? There's somethin' funny about this. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going. I'm getting goose bumps. You don't get goose bumps, those must be pig bumps. So, Gyoshu, how long is it going to take to convert this planet? Yes, well, you see, about that. According to the data collected since we touched down, it looks to be quite a difficult task. What? It's your duty to deal with this! Slugg-sama is not as young as he used to be. If we don't act quickly. Er, Slugg-sama! I only meant. Gyoshu, how about it? Aye, Slugg-sama . If we shift the planet slightly off its axis, we will obtain the necessary driving force. How many days do you need? Aye, if I could have ten days. What do you say, Kakuja? Aye, if I could have three days. It is with deepest joy I serve you. I shall commit my entire body and soul to this effort. They really are planning on taking over Earth! We have to get out of here, fast! Gohan-chan! Who's that little punk? Gohan-chan! Chichi-san! Gohan-chan, git down! Mother! How's that? I ain't too bad myself. Mother! It's a Dragon Ball all right. He's. got an awesome battle power. You're the one! You're the head bad guy, right? Whoa, h- hey, Bulma, ho- hold on a sec. Er, that wasn't me who said that! What do you plan to do to us, then? If you will obediently do as we say, then no harm will come to you. As with the other nebulae and star systems governed by Slugg-sama, king of all the universe, this frontier planet will also enjoy his providence. Oh, dear. Slugg-sama has taken quite an interest in your young, cheery planet. As such, he has chosen it to serve as his own vehicle. It is to become his latest Planet Cruiser. Impossible! Whoever heard of turning Earth into a vehicle? It can't be done! With our level of technology, it is a simple matter. It's the same level of technology that allowed us to avoid colliding with your world, after all. Unbelievable! Young miss, this is a Dragon Ball, isn't it? How could you know? I dimly recall something like this, stirring in the recesses of my memories. Supposedly, it can grant you anything you desire. Unfortunately for you, unless you can get all seven of the Dragon Balls together, you won't get your wish! Bulma-san! Oh, too late. I'll see what's on your mind for myself! I'm. not involved in any of this! I'm not involved! Bulma-san! Gohan-kun! They truly are wonderful! Use this to locate the other Dragon Balls. You have one hour! One hour? Medamatcha! Aye, it will be a pleasure. "Come forth, Shen Long, and grant me my wish!" It looks as if Earth has come under the attention of someone terrible. Now, speak thy wish. I shall grant thee any single wish. Bestow upon me eternal youth! I wish for you to make me young again, when I was at my most powerful! It is an easy request. It's returned! I now have my exceptional youth again! My youth! When I was at my greatest power! I have granted thy wish. Fare thee well! Now I no longer have to be concerned with growing old and dying! From now on, I have nothing to fear! So long as I have this youth, the ends of the universe are mine for the taking! Now, hasten the conversion of this Earth! Much better! All right! At last, this planet has become suitable to those of us of the Demon Clan. It's still a little bit too warm. Being of the Demon Clan means that we cannot last for even one hour in direct sunlight. This will ensure that the Earthlings will be completely wiped out. It also spares us the trouble of killing them ourselves. It also speeds up them other guys' work. I'm alive. Does that mean the Kamehame-Ha worked? What're ya babblin' about? Yajirobe! Yer alive 'cuz I come an' fed ya a Senzu. D'ya know how hard it was findin' ya's? So that's it. This is terrible. What's up with that cloud cover? See ya. I'm leavin' the rest up t' you. I'm so cold I might freeze t' death. Oh, chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly! Yajirobe! Let me have a Senzu too, okay? Whuzzis? I nearly fergot 'bout ol' Pachinko-head! What did you call me? Well, if ya don' like it, it's fine by me. Hold on! What'm I gonna do with ya's? Here. Chichi-san, you shouldn't overdo it. It's all right. It'll take more than a punch like that to hurt me. Ow! There, you see? It's all right, it's all right. Gohan-chan , I made some pipin' hot soup for you. Gohan-chan? Gohan-chan ain't here! The outfit he got from Piccolo is also missin'! Come to think of it, Oolong hasn't been around for a while either! You don't think. Gohan, let's go back. It's too cold for us to stand here. Let's go have some nice hot ramen or something. There's no way we can beat them, you know. That's impossible. If you want to go home, you can go. O- okay, gotcha, I'd rather stay with you. Hey, you! What are you doing there!? Oolong-san, this way! Hey, it's that brat! Don't move! Here they all come! What should I do? Maybe if I play dead. Youth is such a wonderful thing! They just keep coming. Fire! Gang up on him! Piccolo-san! Slugg-sama! What is it? What's all the racket? Piccolo-san, thank you! Gohan, this battle is just starting. You pathetic wimps! We'll take over from here! This is awful. Everything's frozen! You look like you may actually last a while against me! Hey, Medamatcha, I'll let you take the brat. Guess I'm out of luck. I'm more out of luck than either of you. You underestimate us, runts. What did you call me!? You sure do run away quickly. Let's see if that's all I do quickly. Enough! He's. he's strong! Darn you! You're tougher than I gave you credit for. But I've seen everything you've got now. Take this! Those guys are sucking all of your energy out of you! Fill up on him, boys! Come right on down here and get me! I'll finish you with one blow! W- wait! You're a Demon Clansman too! Why don't you team up with us? After all, you're no match for Slugg-sama. I see that as a fellow Demon Clansman, you've taken my words to heart. Dorodabo, how pathetic! Order up! Gohan! I've taken nearly all your energy! Now I'm going to put you to rest! Gohan! Hold on! You have to face me! Wise guy! No you don't! Fool! It's too late! Whoa! Gohan! More, more! To think we got this worked up to defeat those two. This really isn't our lucky day. We have to finish off the little guy too. Off you go, to the Next World! Who's there!? There's no need for them to hurry their deaths! And yet these two come wandering in looking for it. Sooner or later, you will all meet your icy fate. Hey, hold on! We're not finished talking to you! Lousy punk! Gohan, hold on! Father. Gohan, you've done well. Now, leave the rest up to your father. Son. You've got a lot of nerve. You guy's ain't no match for me. I won't say anything bad about you if you'll just take that cloud-looking thing and leave Earth. Angira, did you hear that? He says we're no match for him! He must think pretty highly of his own strength. You underestimate our power! I ain't saying anything bad about you. How dare you mock us! Whoa, where did he go? Why, that rotten. Medamatcha! Such strength! Who is this!? How dare you! You rat! No more playing around! Now, Medamatcha! Goku! Impossible! I didn't even get a turn. Worthless crumbs! And you call yourselves my men!? You must be Slugg. You're a Saiyan, right? I'm an Earthling! And you're leaving Earth, now! Very well. This is a perfect opportunity to test out my restored youth. This Ki of his, it's distinctly different from that of anyone else I've felt before. I guess now it's my turn. Goku, leave this to me! Stop! You're no match for him! Why does this only happen to me? Kuririn! Why, you! What's the matter? Is this the best you've got? I figured you for a Saiyan, but I guess I sized you up wrong. So strong! Gohan. I can't stand up to him! After all the training I've done, my power still ain't no use against him! How many more seconds can you last? Aw, crap. Oh no, we're not done yet. I ain't about to lose! I can't lose! Everybody. Lend me your. Lend me your power. It's no use. Goku, there just isn't enough spare power left on Earth. Now then, shall we finish this? Die! What!? Unbelievable! His power is rising so quickly! What's this? How can Goku have this kind of power left in him? Unless-- could this be the power of a Super Saiyan!? What!? Where does his strength come from? What's his secret? I didn't think you could come this far. So then, I guess I'll have to reveal my true power as well. You mean. You're a. I know him, Goku! Kaio-sama, is that you? Slugg is a Namekian that left Namek, back before it faced extinction, just like the Kami of Earth did. He was sent as a baby to Planet Slugg. What's more, he's no ordinary Namekian! What's wrong!? Has seeing my true form frightened you off!? He probably doesn't realize it himself, but through a mutation rare to Namekians, ever since he was born, evil has been the only thing to have grown in his heart. If that's the case, his wickedness is incomparable to Piccolo's, what with him having splintered off from Kami. The reason being that Slugg is one hundred percent pure evil! He's a Super Namekian! A Super Namekian? Unless I miss my guess, not even Freeza, or perhaps even a Super Saiyan, can stand up to him! Shoot! So, now what!? It's over! Not yet! Father! Goku! Son! You've fought well, but this is where it ends. Die! I'm a Namekian too, just like you are! What!? I know every single one of your weaknesses! No! Why you! You dare interfere!? Huh? What are you laughing about? What!? Gohan! Start whistling! Whistle that song you were showing me! Whistle? That song that you had Haiya Dragon dance to that one time. Hurry! Piccolo-san! Hurry! Start whistling! Whistling? Gohan! Whistle! Whistle now! I don't know what you're trying to pull, but nothing you do will work on me! Whistle! Gohan, whistle! Wha- what!? Whistle! Stop that! It's working! Suffer through that! So, that's why you removed your own ears!? That's right! Just as humans can't stand the sound of scraping on glass, to a Namekian's sense of hearing, the wavelength of human whistling must resound terribly. He must be having an unbearable, nerve-racking time of it. Son! Go- Goku! Take my power! It's up to you now, Goku! Piccolo! I won't let your feelings be for nothing! Stop it! Stop! Slugg-sama! Slugg! You! Kaio-ken! What? What's this Ki!? I did it! G- Goku! Father! Goku won? Hooray. All right, now for that cloud. Slugg! Sun, you're the only one I can rely on now. Lend me some of your Genki energy. Why you!! All right! Genki-dama! Son Goku, well done. Slugg was mistaken to think he could expand his empire- by taking action against Earth. But to think he was able to defeat a Super Namekian. Son Goku may very well be a Super Saiyan. Goku! Father! Are you guys all right? Yajirobe! I figgered it'd turn out like this, so I brought y'all some Senzu. You're a fine one to speak, you've just been in hiding all this time. What're ya sayin'? I'll have ya know I wuz. --Oh no! --It can't be! Let me have. a Senzu too. Piccolo! Piccolo-san, your ears. That's my Piccolo-san! Oh, I sure slept well. Looks like another beautiful day. A-one, and-a-two, and-a-three, and-a-four, and-a-one, and-a-two, and-a-three, and-a-four. What's wrong? Staring downward with such a gloomy look, Throw your chest forward! Put on a happy face! Show some energetic cheer, (full of energy!) and keep on shouting that gross things are gross! Dodon-Pa! (Dodon-Pa!) If you should fall down, just get right back up, and keep on walking forward! Kamehame-Ha (Kamehame-Ha!) If someone's bullying you, hit him with an explosion of kicks, it's a Knock-out! Kaio-ken! (Kaio-ken!) You have to take care of yourself, or you won't be able to study! Genki-dama! (Genki-dama!) Don't get angry comparing yourself to the kids around you, it's a Knock-Out, It's up to you! How's that? Feeling better, aren't you? [Music][Rhythmic Drumbeats] [Music][Drumbeats Continue] [Music] [Music] [Singing In Native Dialect] [Music] [Music] Okay, swing. That's it, swing. Nice and level. Put it in there! [Native Dialect] Run! Run! Wrong way! First! First! Wrong way! Other way! Other way! Go, go, go, go! Hold it! Hold it! [Man] Telephony! Hey! Telephony! U.S.! [Indistinct Chatter] These guys are great natural athletes. Jerry, they're developing. their own unique style of baseball here. I could file on African baseball on a regular basis. - Maybe, you know, do a feature or. - Yeah, that's fine. But enough of these African baseball stories. George, there's an opening on the sports desk. How soon can you and Suzy get back here? Um, about a week. - When, when do you want me to start? - Hey, man, we need you by Monday. - Do you want the job or not? - Yeah! Uh. Get the cheeseburgers ready, Jerry, because I'm gonna be home by Christmas. - Thanks a lot, buddy. - See you soon. All right! Ooow! [Whistle] Susan! I've got real news! Wait till I tell you. I don't wanna miss Eric. Well, that's downright Jurassic. Fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, don't you think? It's a neck structure of a brontosaurus. - Small head, slender neural cord. - Let's carbon-date it. - We could. - I'll get it ready. Paris or London? Shall I send a telex? - You could. - What's wrong? This bone is about 80 years old. No. There's no point in showing me that, Susan, my dear. I wrote it. Don't you remember? This, I think, is more what you should be looking at. Oh, no. It's not a giraffe. - Or am I just a total idiot? - On the contrary. You're the brightest post-doc we've had out here. Don't worry about it, my dear. - I thought I really had something. - Excuse me. - Susan, may I speak with you? - Hello, George. I'm afraid that your wife has had a slight scientific disappointment. - You all right? - It's okay. I just wanted to find something real important before I left. Susan, you know that most field work is patience and frustration. You're young. Don't rush it. In other words, some days you eat the bone; other days, the bone eats you. Come on. Hi, Nigel. Ready to sharpen his pencils today? - Must you always be sarcastic? - Au revoir, Nigel. Is that Little Miss Scientist's latest discovery? Yes. From Bateke. She's top-notch at her job, Nigel. whether you like her or not. - Is it any good? - I doubt it. Now don't patronize me, Eric, please. I know that look. How good is it? [Eric] She knows nothing. If these scrapings are from Bateke, I imagine the photo is true. - A trip is indicated. - You do know that Etienne is dead. Oh, yes, terrible thing. Fine scientist. Well, are you going to tell her that we're going to Bateke because of her scrapings? No, I'm not, and neither are you. Mmm, the beer that made Ogbomosho famous. How about that? I can finally say "Ogbomosho," and we're going home. The Post is really lucky to get you. It's great. It's just. I have the funniest feeling about this bone. Susan, we made a deal. I wanted to do something real while I was here. We'll start our real life when we get home. What's that supposed to mean? You know. - A baby. - Sure, couple, three, four. - Four! - I'm one of six! - Well, then, you have 'em. - Well, I'd give it a shot. Carl Yastrzemski Loomis. That's got kind of a rhythm. Jane Goodall Loomis, maybe. Hmm, that'd be all right. As long as she could throw a spitball. - I wanted to find my own dinosaur. - You'll have a reason to come back. We'll miss you. - I'll write. I promise. - Do that. - Good morning. - Morning. I heard about your husband's job. Congratulations. Absolutely splendid. It should suit him. As you know, I can help you in Washington. You choose any school or museum you like. and you'll get the highest possible recommendation. Thank you. I really appreciate it. One thing before you go. Dr. Pierre Dubois from the Red Cross. is in the lab office. Could you have a chat with him before you leave? Sure. Of course I will. - Are you leaving, too? - Just for a few days. In fact, we really should get going. Chop, chop. - Well, very best of luck to you. - Bye. Do you know anything about the Senuofo, Dr. Matthews? - No, not really. - They are quite remote. Ten days ago, a government patrol discovered cholera at one of their villages. They brought back two patients, both, uh, died. It was not cholera. It was staphylococcus. It's, uh, food poisoning. Do you understand that Dr. Kiviat and I. - are paleontologists, not physicians? - Oh, yes. But the Senuofo have eaten the same diet for a thousand years. There's never been a recorded case of staphylococcus before. They have eaten an animal they can't or won't identify. This, uh. is what they ate. - Can you identify it? - Giraffe. It's impossible. It's not a mammal. Listen, George, it's hardly even a detour. We catch the ferry, see what's going on. It puts us back a day and a half, maybe two. Which are the first two days of my new job. They've been getting the paper out without you all this time. They don't need you Monday. Dealing with food poisoning is not your job, Susan. No, that's not my job. But finding out what's with these bones is my job. Turn off the light. George, it could be an entire skeleton. It could be a major find, my find. Go to sleep. I said, turn off the light, Susan. We gotta get up and pack tomorrow. [Smacking] Damn! Susan! Susan! No! Bitch! Pardonnez-moi. Was there an English woman on that thing? - Une femme anglaise? - Definitely. Is there any way I can charter an airplane? Oh, definitely. - All right, let's go, right now. - Next Thursday. - No, no, no, now. Rapidement. - Next Thursday. Isn't there any way I can get upriver fast? I have a friend who has got a very fine airplane. Would you like to charter it? Yes, definitely. Kenge Obe offers a variety of package expeditions. tailored to the individual tastes and schedules of the patron. I seem to be out of brochures at the moment. I'm surprised this thing can even fly! Oh, yes. Well, that is because of the skilled ability of the pilot. How far? How long is it to Sangha? A long ways. Long, long ways. But don't worry. We have plenty of outward fuel supplies. Kenge Obe is always prepared for every contingency. - And this. - Shit. The finest of your kind music. Bon appetit. You like it? [Music] [Rock And Roll] [Music] Then she leaves me a note like a goddamn milkman or something. I mean, I gave up six months of my life to come tagging along. in this godforsaken country, six months of my career! - If you look to the left, [lndistinct] - I'm sure it's not godforsaken. if you come from here, it's just that. sometimes she's like talking to a stone wall. - You know what I mean? - [lndistinct] Tried talking to her about having kids! My God! You'd think it was some kind of barbaric custom from dark. I'm one of six brothers and sisters! - Is that so? I myself had 19. - Nineteen? Yeah, my father had, uh, four wives. Four wives! I got all I can handle with one! I can't let her get away with it. What would you do? If it were my wife. I'd whip the bitch. [Music][Rock And Roll Continues] [Music] [Chanting] [Chanting Continues] [Chanting Continues] Susan. Got your note. George, he's dying. Dr. Dubois, this is my husband, George Loomis. - Monsieur. - Bonjour. Oh, this is my tour guide, Sky King. - Do you understand Senuofo? - Yeah, I speak a little. We're trying to find out what this man ate. That's the chief. He's preparing to die. - No, no, no, no. No! - Huh? - [Native] - [Native] [Native] [Native] Two of their hunters found it upriver. - Dead. - [Native] [Native] They have brought the meat back and everyone who ate it is sick. or dead. [Native] Looks like a brontosaurus. [Native] Where? Where upriver? George, thank you. You should bloody well tell me my messages as they come in. - Okay. It is not okay. You make things very difficult. Okay. Eric. Apparently your favorite post-doc and her husband. are now chasing their bone at a Sangha village upriver. - Where did you get that information? - Dubois. - Red Cross. - Damn it. Blast it! We're at the wrong place. Get me government house. Tommy! - What is going on? - You'll find out in due course. We're going to need a boat and an escort. Tommy! She's a persistent little devil, isn't she? If this is where they left the carcass, then it should be here. Sounds logical. It must have washed with the current. We're gonna have to look over there. What's downriver? Hey, Charlie. [Speaking Native Dialect] [Native] No problem. You won't get lost. This is the Kenge Obe communications module. There's a transceiver. There's a transmitter chip. You can. You can beep each other. Also, the wraps and radio, plus this excellent guide. Rent or buy? Food is extra. I'll be back to pick you up in two days. Make it a rental and tell him he goes with us. Hey, Charlie. [Native] - [Native] - [Protesting] No problem. [Susan] Oh, my God! George. Hey! Where are ya going? [Native] "No problem." What a place, huh? Something big's been through here. Look at those broken branches. - George? - Come on. Oh, my God! [Native] - Hello? - [Native] - [Native] - [Native] Amigos. [Yelling, Laughing] George, maybe you should give them something? - We would like to give you a gift. - Huh? What would you like me to give them, Susan? Show your watch. Show it. Show them how it ticks. It doesn't tick. It's a goddamn digital. Try it anyway, George. - You like my watch? - [Beeping] [Beeping Continues] [Beeping] [Native] Have any other ideas? [George] Oh, terrific. It's a convention. Maybe they'd like my. pants. It's what they could use. [George] Susan! - Susan! Don't! Their soul! - It's okay. It's just a picture. It's okay. Come on, it's all right. [Woman Laughing] Think happy thoughts. [Native] Mmm. [Gulp] This is absolute "craporama." Dead ants. Live ants. I think I'm going to die. Ah. Here, uh, try a little half-eaten hippie food. [Sniffing] [Crunching] - [Whispering] - [Chuckling] Mmm. [Laughing] [Laughing] I don't like it either, boss. - I'm George. - Huh? - My name, George. - Cephu. Cephu, how do you do? [Native] [Crying] You okay? [Crying] [Kissing Sound] It's okay. [Music][Drumbeats] This I like. [Native] What is this stuff anyway? Near beer. It's near enough. [Susan] George? I feel really strange. Me too. [Native] Have you seen this thing? [Hissing] George, did you see that? - What's with him? - [Drums Stop] Hey. - They just disappeared. - [lndistinct Moan] - Listen. - [Moaning Continues] George, you hear that? Do you hear that? [Whispering] That's an elephant or something. Hello? Where'd everybody go? I always like to thank the host of the party before I leave. Come on, let's set up a tent. Those guys just disappeared into thin air. And that sound. I don't know. It could have been a hippo, except hippos don't. make a trumpet sound like that. - Spooky, huh? - Yeah. I've never heard anything like it, George. Whatever it was, it's gone now. - Now? - Why not? 'Cause the natives might be outside still. They can watch. [Indistinct Rumbling] It's a little earthquake. It stopped. - [Indistinct Noise] - The wind? The wind. Kind of nice how the jungle makes noises at night, isn't it? Crickets and stuff. - Yeah. - [Crickets Stop] Yeah, not everybody gets to experience this. It's a marvelous opportunity. George, you're not sorry you're here, are you? No, no, no. Really, Susan, I'm not. George, I don't know if I'm in the mood anymore. Do you mind? Oh, come on. [Indistinct Animal Trumpet] [Susan Screaming] [Screaming] [Animal Moaning] - [Moaning] - Whoa. [Music] - [Chattering] - [Music] [Loud Rock] [Music] Would you be very kind? Thank you. - [Protesting] - Oooh! [Laughing] Thank you very much. Oooh! Is this absolutely essential, Colonel? They are fighting men, Professor. They need their diversions. I wish you were looking in an area the government controls. The natives are scared of the Mokele-Mobembe. I don't think they'll present any problem. - You aren't frightened? - On the contrary, my dear Colonel. I've been on its trail for far too long. We're like old friends. Besides, we have our military escort. [Gunfire] - [Rumbling] - Listen. Come on. Oh, George. Oh, my God! It's beautiful. Get down. The wind's at his back. He can't get our scent. I need pictures. Get my camera. Quick! Susan. [Camera Clicking] - George, look. - I see. - It's the female. - How do you know? George, it's a hatchling. It is. It really is. Take pictures. Take pictures. We're looking at 150 million years ago. My God. You realize you're gonna be the most famous scientist in the world? And you're gonna cover it. [Camera Clicking] [Roaring] They might be great, but I don't know how friendly they are. [Braying] [Cooing] What I don't understand is what they're doing this far south. What I don't understand is what they're doing alive. Ready? Maybe they ran out of this fruit where they used to live. - Think that's enough? - Yeah, okay. Following the food supply. You know, George, that's not bad. - I guess we can get a little closer. - You know what we've got to do? We've got to get them used to us so we can stick one of Kenge's radio chips on them. Jump back, Jack. Woo! Look at you! Aah! - George of the jungle. - Come on. - [Growling] - Chow time. They're getting used to us. Great. They love it. [George] That's it, guys. Pig out. [Cooing] Hey, look. Behind you. The baby. Terrific. You can put the transmitter on him. - Hey! Hey, you! Leave that alone. - [Braying] Oh! Susan, he's got big teeth. Where'd he go? [Squawking] - You see him? - He's underwater. On the right. George? George? [Screaming] Here, Baby, it's all right. It's all right. God, George, you scared her. No, no, no, stay here. - Real funny. - Come on, it's okay. It's all right. Some food. Come on. No, no, wait, wait. Here, here, here. No, no, come on. Hungry? Free meal. That's it. Is it. Look at you. Are you friendly? You like that? Yeah. Look at these ears. Wow. Yeah. Whoa, don't step on me. Came to visit us. Yeah. She's like a little elephant, isn't she? It's playing. Dinosaurs don't play. - It's weird. - Isn't her skin nice? I thought it would be more scaly. Well, you're not so bad. You're kind of friendly. Yeah. - [Growling] - What the. [Eric] Use the tranquilizer gun. In the neck. Aim carefully. [Eric] And another. In the neck. [Snarling] Give it time. [Cheering] [Growling] Get back! Get back! Colonel, don't shoot! [Yelling] [Nigel] Oh, no! Stop them, for god's sake! [Growling] [Growling] [Moan] [Growling] [Moaning] [Eric Whispering] What an animal! Millions of years. Have you any idea what you've done? - That was a one-of-a-kind specimen. - No, Professor. It was one of two. That is a one-of-a-kind specimen. Get down! Susan! - Don't go over there. - [Moan] - Shh. Keep her quiet. - Keep her quiet? - She's trying to get to her mom. - Quiet! Keep her here. Kiviat, what in the hell are you doing, man? I was under the impression you were a scientist. What? You gonna have it stuffed. right here on the spot? Mr. Loomis, you will kindly keep your mouth shut. - Secure the creature. - Yes. - Don't do it, Nigel. - Well, I. - Oh, my God! - Your prisoner? We do not take prisoners. [Rifle Cocking] Don't! Don't! Don't! - Agh! - Take cover! - [Shouting] - Move! [Gunshots] Susan! Run, Susan! Yeah! [Native] Still want to set up your field lab here, Professor? - We'll have to take her back. - [Chuckling] [Cooing] [Cooing] [Squawking] [Growling] [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning] They did a job here, didn't they? What a mess! They got the radio. - The receiver's okay. - This works. [Moaning] Oh, God, George, look! Doesn't have much of a chance, does he? She'll never survive without her mother. Baby, come here. Baby, Baby, come on. No, no. - Come on, Baby. Come on. - [Kissing Sounds] - [Growling] - [Susan] Come on, come on. Come on. [Braying] You know, George, if we caught it, maybe we could beat Eric back. It could be our discovery. [Moaning] [Moaning, Sniffing] [Growling] [Growling] - [Chattering] - [Moaning] - [Moaning] - [Moaning] [Moaning] - [Chattering] - [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning Continues] [Cooing] [Tape Rewinding] - Here. - Got it covered. All right, that a girl. Don't hurt her. - [Snarling] - Ow! She bit me! - [Growling] - [Grunting] - Hold on to her, George! - I'm tryin'! - Hold on! - Grab her! Grab her! [Susan] I'm trying! I'm trying! George, hold her back. It's okay. It's okay. - Shh. - [Grunting] It's okay. Calm down. It's me, see? Look, it's me. Shh, shh. You'll be okay. Shh. You'll be okay. She'll take a bath. You'll be fine, Baby. [Cooing] It's okay. It's all right. Shh. [Chanting] [Growling In Time With The Chanting] - [Growling] - Don't do that, idiot! [Eric] Oh, my God, she's had more than 200 CCs already! Help me! Help me! Come on, you blockhead! Take the rope! - She'll have to have a stimulant. - I have it. Help me up. Right. Well done, Nigel. Really. You must excuse my assistant, my dear Colonel. Heat of the moment. You know, I'm, I'm beginning to take an active interest. in your career and, uh. you know I have the aid of the president. One day I should like to see you "General" Nsogbu. For all our sakes, we mustn't lose this one, must we? Lose one, you keep one. I call that acceptable losses, Professor. [Whimpering] [Moaning] [Growling] - [Whimpering] - What's your problem? - Are you still hungry? - [Groaning] She already ate 200 pounds of of malumbo fruit. Oh. Who said you had to make such a pig of yourself, hmm? You'll be okay. - Okay? - [Groan] [Whining] [George] Oh. Get him outta here. Ow! Get off my toe! She wants. - Oh, get off my foot! - She's not feeling well. She's just a baby. It'll be all right. - Oh, what breath! - Shh. [George] Good God! - Come on, George. Come on! - Heave, heave! [Groaning] George, will you stop fooling around? Come on. Aah. She's still hungry. [George] Why'd they put these so high up? [Ripping] Shoot! There goes my pants! Wasps! Wasps! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow-ow-ow! I don't think we're that far from where Kenge dropped us off. If he waits for us, I think we have a shot at beating Eric. Nifty. Ow! - Still hurts, huh? - Look at the size of this sucker, huh? [George] Oh, yeah, that feels nice. - You like that, huh? - Work your way up right there. Up, up, now to your left. Right there. - [Cooing] - Yuck! Come on, Baby. Come on, come on. - Not now. Go on, go on. - No, no, no. Get outta here. [Cooing] Hey, hey, go on. Get outta here. - Leave my shirt. Get outta here. - Out of here. Play with ya later. [George] Come here and plant one on me. - Oh! Oh! - Oh! - French-kissed my nose! - [Laughing] - It kissed me. - No. - [Whining] - [Susan] No, Baby, no. Dragon breath. Get outta here! - [Moaning] - Come here. [Moaning] [Moaning] George, Baby. Where's Baby? Baby! - Oh, God! - I'm sure she's right around here. Baby! Baby! I don't know how she'll feed herself, George. She can't reach the malumbo. We'll just have to keep looking. - [Beeping] - Wait a minute. - I got something here. - Baby? - [Beeping] - Yeah, she's over that way. [Beeping] [Helicopter Engine Whirring] [Susan] It's Eric. - Do you think they have Baby? - I don't see her. Could have gotten the signal from something else over there though. - [Moaning] - [Susan] Oh, look at the mother. - We have to help her. - What do you suggest? - We walk in there with a writ? - We have to try. [Indistinct Chatter] Don't you worry. We'll get you back to your baby. I can't get these ropes. You'll have to use your knife. - [Sniffing] - I know you miss her. I miss her too. - She smells Baby on your belt. - Huh? You used it for a leash. - [Growling] - [Native Shouting] [Shouting] [Machine Gun Fire] - Come on! - I'm coming. Halt! Halt! Whoa, whoa, whoa! They were attempting to steal the people's discovery. [Native] It's really great, Eric. Is this paleontology by the books? Welcome to the People's Army. - Hey, watch it. - Hey! You will stop telling people what to do. That's a very bad habit you people have got. You are not a citizen in this country. You're a criminal and you have no rights. If that is not clear, we will make it clear! [Native] - What is the matter with those two? - They're in a bit of a pickle. - [Moaning] - [Native] [Moaning] Open up. So. a brontosaurus hatchling. Amazing find. Remarkable object for study. I don't know what you're talking about. I. read your notes, my dear. Your behavioral observations were most impressive. A little unschooled, but written on the run, I realize that. You've attached a homing transmitter to the hatchling, have you not? It can't be too far away. I think we can track it down. A hatchling. That's very dear to me. I'm going to find it. You're going to help me, aren't you? Hmm? Good night. [Indistinct Chatter] - [Nigel] Eric. Eric! - Go away. No, listen. It's the animal. Her heartbeat's irregular. The breathing's impaired. I told him no more tranquilizers. All he ever thinks about is being made a general. Now he's planning to airlift her by crate in a helicopter. She'll never survive it! Oh, Eric, what are we doing? Go to bed, Nigel. Sleep. I'll have a chat with the colonel. [Eric] Colonel! - May I? - What is it, Professor? - More debate about your prize? - Nothing of the sort. She's become rather restive and I have just prepared some of this. very special serum but it doesn't fit our instrument. May I? Please. Thank you. This is our. very best stuff. Guaranteed to reduce her to near death. Thank you. And, uh, total immobility. - Oh, spare me your sarcasm, Professor. - Certainly. [Muffled Groaning] [Native] Oh, good morning. What appears to be the problem? They say that we killed the colonel. - We found this in their belongings. - That confirms my suspicions. - CIA is what they are. - What are you talking about? They're trying to prevent us from taking back the people's discovery to the capital. It's a plot to undermine the revolutionary government. You're outta your mind. [Native] No! - Oh, my God! - Don't shoot! We need them. There's a treasure buried out there. We can track it on our radio receiver, but we do need them. - What kind of treasure? - Gold. CIA. CIA always has gold. Hidden. [Whispering] Could be yours. [Beeping] I think we're on to it. Lower. - [Sniffing] - [Helicopter Engine Whirring] [Moaning] [Whimpering] There it is! Here! What is this? - Is that your treasure? - That, my friend. is the most valuable thing on earth. But you said gold! Give me that gun! Try for the neck. Don't! Aaah! Jump! Turn back. Turn back! Hey, babe. How ya doin', huh? How ya doin'? Come on, we gotta go. Come on, come on! Let's go, go! - Let's look for someplace we can hi.! - George! What's down there? There's a cave. Come on, Susan. Come on, Baby. I can't see. Gotta have light. I'll make a torch. - [Engine Whirring] - Listen. They're landing. Come on. It's okay. That's it, Baby. Come on. Get a move on, you fellows! Not so fast. - [Growling] - Quiet! Quiet! George, Susan, show yourselves! - Shh. Come on. - [Eric Shouting] All I require is the hatchling. - [Screeching] - What is that? Oooh! Ah, George! Oh, they're getting in my hair! George! [Growling] Watch your eyes! Come on! [Screeching] Aaah! [Rifle Shots] Don't! You'll hit the animal. Come on. [Gasping] Ow! Oh, my God! Damn it! Oh, George. Oh! The game is over. Hold this! Go! Don't! [Gasping] Ohhh! George! - Susan! - George! - We made it! - - We made it, all right. We made it! [Susan] Where's Baby? Baby, are you all right? [Screeching] [Birds Chirping] [Twittering] [Sniffing] - What's she doing? - I don't know. Hey! Hey! Over there. [Baby Braying] Susan! Susan, there's nothing we can do. [Sniffing, Sad Moaning] Well, she's alive. I said that's all I wanted. That's all we should want. There, there. [Growling] Hello, George and Susan. I can't see you, but I'm sure you're out there somewhere. It's better for science that we have the mother and the hatchling. I'm most profoundly grateful to you. Take care of yourselves. Bye-bye. [Groaning] I don't know what she sees in these things. I think I was starting to believe we were her parents. I didn't do that many drugs in college. They're probably gonna dope her silly. A bunch of grad students giving her a physical every ten minutes. That's what I was gonna do. But she likes you. [Native] [Buzzing] [Buzzing] - Mokele-Mobembe. - Mokele-Mobembe? Come on. - [Native] - Hey, you are late! And guess what I saw downriver? Your dinosaur! We steal it back. It won't be easy, but Kenge Obe doesn't worry. - because it's no problem! - No problem! Right! [Indistinct Chatter] [Moaning] How is the little one? She's just so scared. I've given her some morphine. Splendid. Absolutely splendid. [Man] Fire! Get our equipment! Move! Damn it, move! [Shouting] [Shouting] Still no Kenge. We're just gonna have to wait. Halt! Stand guard. Trigger! Cephu. [Yelling] [Native] [Machine Gun Fire] - [Native] - [Shouting] Let's go. [Machine Gun Fire, Shouting] Aaah! - Look, George! - It's about time. - All right! - Yeah! [Machine Gun Fire, Shouting] Oh. No problem. - Now. - Why not? [Grunting] - [Wailing] - [Roaring] Sic 'em! [Roaring] [Machine Gun Fire] Come on! [Roaring] - [Wailing] - [Roaring] Hold on! [Wailing] [Snarling] [Crying] [Groaning] [George] Stop! Pull over! [Susan] Stop, Eric! [Tires Screeching] [Susan] I'm warning you! [Eric Screaming] [Grunting, Groaning] God. Oh, God. [Rumbling] - [Roaring] - [Eric Screaming] George. [Moaning] [Growling Gently] [Moaning] George. Oh, thank God. [Cooing] [Sighing] [Contented Growling] - [Grunting] - Baby. you don't belong to me. Just another legend? If we let it be. Come on. [Braying] [Braying] - [Moaning] - [Braying] {{{ the end }}} Is that your son? - Yes, sir. - Big fan of the Justice League. Yeah. He used to play with a toy submarine I gave him, but not anymore. His dad can't compete with heroes like Superman around. Well, not all heroes wear capes. - Yes, sir. - Take us. Investigating an SOS beacon in the middle of the Atlantic. That's pretty heroic. - What is it? What's wrong? - Sonar has inbound, sir. Impossible, it's open ocean for miles. Computer has 15. No, 22 separate inbound. Evasive maneuvers. Now. Captain, the inbound, they've changed course. Sir, 37. Now 55 inbound still on target. We have to return fire. At what? We don't know what's chasing us. Coming in hot. Impact in T-minus 15. - They look like. - Like what? - T-minus 10. - Like people. Brace for impact. We've lost propulsion. Engine room, report. Taking water, captain. Engine room. Engine room. SOS. This is the S.S. California with an emergency SOS. We are under attack. I only hope someone hears th. This is Colonel Trevor, government liaison to the Justice League. No, we changed it last week. "Justice League" tested better. Oh, crap. Victor, wait up. No. Not now. It's time Victor. Time to wake up. No, please, just a little longer. Please. Dr. Charles. Please, Vic, it's Sarah. Right. Sarah. I forgot. I came by to see how you were doing after the operation. Fine. The environmental upgrades you and my dad made. to my systems will make me more useful in the field. And you're okay with us replacing your remaining human lung? At this point, I'm more machine than man anyway. As long as I have my brain and heart intact, I'll be all right. Okay, well, I guess I'll check you later? Yeah, do that. Way to go, Stone. Incoming call from Silas Stone. Ignore. Figured I'd find you here. You're always here. Naval sub went dark and sank to the ocean floor mid-Pacific. Pulling it up now. Sounds like they're being slaughtered. The Navy wants their missiles back and I want to know what happened. I'll boom down there and check it out myself. - You want help? - If it was done manually. I won't be able to track anything besides point of access. Maybe security cameras could give me a visual. - I meant, you could call the League. - I know what you meant. Until we have answers, no need to escalate this any higher. Have it your way. Let me know what you find. Sir. The others? They don't really come in. At all. Despite what you would like the world to think, Colonel Trevor, there is no Justice League. It's a beautiful view, isn't it? It is. I forget to enjoy it sometimes. This must have been what the view from Olympus was like. We're not like the gods, but we're not like them, either. We're not like anyone. Do you ever feel alone? Diana, of course I do. But I've learned a way to deal with it. I can show you. You know, buddy, life sucks. Never believed it before, but I believe it now. I buried my dad this week. I'm all alone. - Look at this. - Who is that? Talking to himself again. He's been staring at the aquarium. Hey, another one over here. Okay. But I'm cutting you off after this one, Arthur. Now, where were we? Yo, leave him alone. We're talking. Arthur, I know you miss your dad, but. I was gonna eat that. Then you're gonna have to go through me first. Works for me, tough guy. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, let's go. After all these years. I found him. He's exactly what we've been looking for, David. We must confront him. Tonight. Maybe we shouldn't out him here just yet, doctor. We can approach him in the morning. Thanks, guys. I needed to blow off some steam. Always kind of wondered about that. What the hell are you? I wish I knew, pal. I wish I knew. Here you go, buddy. I gotta thank Sarah for those upgrades. No way I'm doing this if I hadn't replaced that lung. Reminder set. Scan for discrepancies. Scanning. Structure compromised. Yeah, I can see that. But by what? Magnify. - Is that a handprint? - Affirmative. Accessing security footage. Error. Files corrupted. Damn. Locate missiles. Scanning. Not found. That's not good. What the hell? Servos damaged. Suggest retreat. Hostiles in pursuit. Boom us out of here. Hey dad, I'm home. Oh, right. You contacted everyone? Yeah, Billy. You came. Sure, I prefer ditching school for the day. This chair is nicer than my bed. Hey guys, sorry I'm. Not late? Where is everybody? The human Internet router's having trouble getting the word out. Let's do it the old fashioned way. I'll bet you like Cuban food. I know this sick place. In Cuba. I'm gonna disembowel you, Barry. Took you long enough. Yeah, yeah, what's the what? I was just about to seal the deal. Cyborg's got something. All hands on deck. Race you to headquarters? We have a headquarters? - Clark? - Yeah? This actually works. - I know it. - To hide in plain sight as one of them. Not hide as much as be one of them. The difference eludes me. We can just blend in. Together. Smallville? Is that you? Oh, Lois. Hi. I'm. I'm sorry, sorry. This is. - Lois Lane. - Diana Prince. Ooh. That's some grip. I work with Clark. Closely. We share a by-line sometimes. Diana is a diplomat. Oh. So this is an interview? No. It's a date. Oh. Right. Nice manners, farm boy. Girl like this you take somewhere posh. It's a wonder women go out with you at all. And Diana, love your glasses. Thanks. They're new. Dude, are they on a date? - Look, it's Cyborg. - What are they doing here? I love you, Shazam. - Nice to meet you, gotta go. - He's huge. - We'll need this to go. - Shazam. - What, the Bat's too good for us now? - It's Batman. He doesn't answer hails. Yeah. If I have to be here, so does he. Hal, don't do anything. stupid. Scarecrow don't pay me enough to deal with this shit. You got that right. There he is. Hi, Spooky. You don't write, you don't call. I'm busy. Well, clear your schedule. Because you and I are. I hate that guy. - The League needs you. - This is about the missiles? Lucky guess. Relax, I got this. Hey there, hench-dudes. I'll be handling your arrest today. Get us out of here. Ready? Because we're done here. Are we? Who's the supplier for the aerosol component of the fear toxin? - Who's. Who's the what, now? - Who is the Scarecrow targeting in city hall? No? What about something simple, like where's the Scarecrow? Bro, I caught them for you. You're welcome. I didn't know. I didn't need them caught, I needed them scared. I needed information. Next time you want to help, do me a favor, don't. No energy signatures. This was all done by hand. Who could do that? Besides us? I count four dozen unique handprints moving in sync. Four squadrons. This was a choreographed onslaught. You think Darkseid's army has returned? No. Doesn't fit. Walk us through your assault. Kind of cool. Like watching a 3D movie with no glasses. Freeze. Observations? They avoided his gaze. Kept to the shadows. Used their element. These were warriors. Agreed. Resume. Ooh! That looked like it hurt all over again. Who has the force to knock a quarter ton of metal to the ground underwater? Freeze. That's a barrel roll. These guys are skilled in 360-degree combat. Agreed. Note the sound sensitivity. Makes sense. Sound travels four point three times faster underwater. Kiss ass. Whatever, Mr. Barrel-Roll. Resume. Freeze. So that's what you look like. Magnify. Gills? As in mermaids? As in Atlantis. Where is this? These carvings, I recognize them from the tales of Atlantis I read as a girl. It sunk into the ocean, but its people were saved by the magic of the king's trident. which turned them irreversibly into creatures of the sea. That's a fairy tale. I believe you. Of course he does. So where is it? The location has been lost to time. What does a mythical mystical undersea world need with missiles? And I so dare you to say that five times fast. Obviously, they plan to attack us. Any way you look at this, it's bad. Terrible idea: I saw an Atlantis show on the what's-it channel with this professor. Maybe he can help us. We're at S.T.A.R. labs. The greatest minds on the planet are right next door. Jeez, I said terrible idea. Maybe it's not. Dr. Stephen Shin. I'm scrubbing through his research. He's got some pretty out-there theories about Atlantis. Superman and I will go question Dr. Shin. When did we vote him team leader? What should the rest of us to do? Find Atlantis. Now that the plans have been set in motion, Manta. there is no turning back. You were right to strike first and strike quickly, my liege. My mother will not see it as such. She has yet to grasp the dangers of the surface as you have, Prince Orm. Soon she'll have no choice. She's been waiting for you. Someday, Mera, I will be on the throne and you will guard my body. Let's hope I fall in battle before that day arrives. Perhaps you will. Mother. Your transparent aggression towards the surface world has left Atlantis exposed, Orm. Do you deny it? That ship would have discovered us. Nonsense. Our magic continues to protect us. We are myth. They doubt our very existence. So we hide? Mother, every day the surface dwellers grow stronger. They have guardians with powers that walk among them. Guardians directly responsible for the death of my father, your king. The volcano that killed your father was not the fault of the surfacers. but the one who attacked them. Death by collateral damage in a surface war does not comfort me. They kill our race. They poison our oceans. They will destroy this planet and take Atlantis with it. We must protect our people and attack. As long as I am queen, you will preserve the peace. At all costs. Do I make myself clear? Yes, mother. - Damn her. - Patience, my liege. He has always been a problem child coddled by his father. unsuitable for the throne. Our only hope for peaceful existence with the surface dwellers. is with the one who is of both worlds. What of my other son? Have you seen Arthur? Yes, my queen. - And? - My queen, he is not yet ready. for the weight of the crown. He will learn at my side, Mera. Bring him to me at once. Dad, watch. I can get to the top. Not too far, Arthur. Don't fall in. I can do it. I'm a better swimmer than you are. Arthur, no! I told you to be careful. I saw her, Dad. I saw my mother. She was watching me in the water. - She kissed me. - It was just the sea. - playing tricks on you, son. - No, it was her. I saw her. She left, Arthur, and she's not coming back. It's just you and me now, son, and I'm not going anywhere. These photos of Arthur Curry are proof positive - of everything I've been working towards. - I'm very pleased for you, doctor. The world will have to believe me now. They'll know what I know. - Call me after you've made contact. - I will. Congratulations, David. I could not have found him without you. Thank you, sir. Manta to Drift One, report. Payload ready, sir. Excellent. I will handle the rest. Take your men to Mercy Reef. Give Dr. Shin and the half-breed my warmest regards. Hello? Mr. Curry? Hello? You have to go away. Go away or kill me. I must talk to you, Mr. Curry. Come back later. I'm really hung right now. And not in the good way. I have information you need to know. It's about your father. Thank you for seeing me, Arthur. I have answers for you. I know what you seek. Slow down. Slow down. I had a rough night. Who are you? I am Dr. Stephen Shin, theoretical marine biologist. Your father, Thomas, contacted me. My father's dead. I know. He was looking for answers and I have them. You, my boy, are the key to all of my research. Okay, I'm gonna let you in because I just can't talk through a door anymore. What the hell? Look out! Stand down while you can. Arthur Curry is under my protection by order of Queen Atlanna. Relinquish him to us, Mera. Or what? Or we'll take him over your smoldering corpse. You are welcome to try. Fire. Follow my lead. I am an investigative reporter, you know. Journalism's dead. Someone got here first. - Looks like it's been ransacked. - That's not all. Someone destroyed Shin's life's work. Then where's Shin? Probably dead. How do you figure? You don't destroy someone's work and then let them live to re-create it. Good point. Don't touch anything. Who is this? Whoever he is, he's got gills too. Cyborg, run your facial-recognition program off this picture. Roger that. - Name's Arthur Curry. - I've got a water-logged letter. from a Thomas Curry. But it's illegible. Cyborg, can you extrapolate this text? You got it. Coming at you now. Thomas Curry begging Dr. Shin for help with his son, Arthur. - Why Shin? - Shin suspects Curry's son. is half-Atlantean. Invoke the emergency protocols. We must tend to our wounded first. Do you see? Do you see what the surface dwellers are capable of? This is terrorism. No, this is an act of war. - Yes. - I agree with him. Our people swim in a cloud of fear of the surfacers. This attack tells us what we already know. The surface world wants us dead. My father distrusted the humans. He saw them as inferior to us. He made plans to cleanse the surface. And I say we break the seal on the Atlantean war plans. - Yes. - No. War would cause senseless ruin on both sides. However, I hear the fear behind my son's words. Perhaps it is time for our worlds to come together. - Heresy. - But my queen, our traditions? Have Manta arrange a meeting between myself and this Justice League. I will broker a peace with them in person. As you wish, Mother. Take heart, my people. This violence was an isolated incident. It is addressed. Our magical safeguards remain intact. Do not fear. All is well. Good. You're awake. What's this? Who are you? I'm Mera, sent by your mother, Queen Atlanna, to bring you back to Atlantis. Lady, the only so-called mother I know, ditched me and my dad when I was just a baby. It's far more complicated than that, Arthur Curry. When she was very young, your mother met and fell in love with your father. That union resulted in your birth, our queen's first born. But she was royalty and promised to our king. She could neither wed your father, nor raise a halfling child. Heartbroken, she returned to lead her people. But she never stopped loving you or your father. Now she needs your help. She believes you are our future. and can forestall war and bridge the two worlds. I. I never knew any of this. Follow me. Your mother kept this hidden in these ancient ruins. What is it? This was our king's royal garb. Now it is yours. You find it yet? Not yet. This is a little harder than it looks. Well, I hope so. It doesn't look that hard. I'm digitally cross-referencing every existing mention of Atlantis. Dude, you've gone full-workaholic on me. I mean, you're just like your old man. Don't ever say that, Billy. Hey, thanks for that field data. I'm still working on a patch to quiet the servos. Sarah, I can't talk right now. Justice League business. Whoo! I felt the electricity over here. Ask her out. I don't think so. Seriously, you're bionic, not dead. - Zoom in here. - I'll tell you, Flashman. I've seen my share of weirdo crapola in this job. But Atlantis? Come on. But you're good with the intergalactic cops, aliens and the cybernetic human? - Expand that. - What can I say? Magic gives me the heebie-jeebies. Dispatch a team to a lighthouse in Mercy Reef, coordinates attached. Find Arthur Curry. Fast. - On it. - Beats looking for fairyland. You look perfect. She'll love you. All right, this is nuts. All my life, I've felt like there was something wrong with me. and now, some mermaid comes out of the sea and tells me my mother is alive. and I'm the future of some fairyland I've never seen? I've been lost for so long, but now. I need some air. Are you all right? I'm fine. Everything suddenly makes sense now. Thank you, Mera. But I'm no king. Arthur. Found him. Arthur Curry? I'm the Flash. We've been looking for you. Retreat. You're injured. Hey, I've had worse. I could bandage it. Sure. I mean, only if you want to. Those guys were Atlanteans? Trenchers. Predatory creatures that scavenged the ocean's floor before Atlantis sunk. Sent here to kill Arthur. We are done here. Come with me. Why can't things just go back to normal? Yeah, I don't see that happening. Atlantis thirsts for a new perspective. Someone who understands the surface world and will lead us into the next century. The queen needs a beacon, Arthur. Maybe it's you. I am the sole survivor of my planet. If I had the chance to save my world. and meet one of own race, even for a moment, that would be enough. - Is it done? - No. Your half-brother lives. Even now, he heads towards Atlantis under protection. The pact with the trenchers was your idea. They will return hungry for meat. This is all falling apart. Manta, what of my meeting with the surface guardians? - They're on their way, my liege. - Excellent. It is a mistake. It flies in the face of everything my father ever wanted. What would you have me do, Orm? Sound the drums of war solely to honor your father's memory? Don't bother. You didn't honor him when he was alive. Both cruel and untrue. I am not the only one with your royal blood in my veins. Then you know. Of your betrayal? Or of the illegitimate heir to the throne? I deny nothing, Orm. Your brother, Arthur, can bridge the peace between Atlantis and the surface. We can flourish together in peace. Your judgment is compromised. You refuse to attack the surface because you have a son there. A bastard elder son. You speak to me of betrayal? You, who spilled Atlantean blood and blamed it on the surface world? I have eyes everywhere, Orm, and you will pay for your treachery. I'm afraid after that revelation, my Queen, I can't allow you to leave. Get out of my way. This coup is over. I am queen and war is not in my plans. But it is in mine. Shazam, Flash and I will keep an eye out topside. Cyborg, stay in communication. So tell me, what's she like? It's time you found out for yourself, Arthur. Welcome to Atlantis. From now on, your life is here. By the gods. That's one for the books. It's beautiful. This is your birthright, Arthur. Batman, we're here. Error. Unknown interference. I can't get a signal, in or out of this place. Where is everyone? Something's wrong. Tell me, why is the royal city deserted? Our brave men and women have gone to prepare for war. Not possible. The queen would never allow this. Our queen is dead. Dead? Killed by a surface dweller. Mother. I failed you, my queen. Whoever did this will pay. Welcome, bastard. Is Atlantis everything you dreamed of, brother? Or in your dream, were you on the throne? You killed her. I did. I ran the sword through her myself as she mewled for peace. You can count yourself fortunate, bastard. At least our mother won't be the impediment to your life that she was to mine. I'll tear you apart! Attack! - Stop! - Feel my power, surface dweller. Only royalty can wield the magic of the trident. Offer them to the horrors of the dark trench. This is war. We will cleanse the surface. Soon they shall know that our time has come. I will bring our world crashing down upon theirs! Batman? Still nothing from Cyborg. But you should see this. - What's wrong? What's going on? - I know. Get it on screen. The mother of all tidal waves headed for the eastern seaboard. Is that Metropolis? Secondary confirmation? Holy-freaking-moley. ETA to impact? - Twenty minutes. - How are the three of us. going to evacuate entire cities? We can't. People are going to die. Only royalty can wield the magic of the trident. Come on. I'll take it from here, Arthur. Arthur. You're alive. We both are. Oh, and, funny story: I talk to fish now. And they actually listen. So I'm gonna stop my evil half-brother from destroying the surface world. Do you.? You wanna come? It would be my honor. I'm still foggy on how you escaped. Orm said only royalty could control the magic of the trident. Guess I qualify. Re-establishing contact. Batman, this is Cyborg, do you read me? Are you okay? Fine. But I'm going to shove that magic shrimp fork down Orm's throat. We need to get up top. A tidal wave is about to hit Metropolis. Atlanteans. This is General Sam Lane of the United States Army. I order you to stand down. I am King Orm of Atlantis, general. And you are in no position to issue orders. Kill the humans. For Atlantis. For Atlantis. For Atlantis. - Fire. - For Atlantis. For Atlantis. My turn. Half-breed trash. I won't let you ruin my plans. Look out. John Henry, run! Well, I'll be damned. Run, Jimmy! Your skills do you honor, Atlanteans, but you face an Amazon. I would not want to be on her bad side. All this was my doing. With Orm's mommy issues and sense of entitlement. coaxing him into war was child's play. Frankly, he irks the shit out of me. Once we've sunk the surface world. I'll slit his throat and claim the treasures of Atlantis. Outrageous. Stop this madness, Orm. King Orm, traitor. This is genocide. Billions will die. For what? So that Atlantis can feel safe again? Victory is the only way to ensure our safety. Seize her. Make her watch my triumph. Hey, fish head. It seems we both call down the lightning. Let us see who's magic is stronger. These are your guardians? Children? This will be easier than I ever dreamed. I admire your determination. But the trident is mine to command, Wench. Lantern, I need information. We're not going to win by hitting him as hard as we can. Bro, do not turn this into a learning moment. Anything. He killed his own mother. Does that help? Face me, Orm. - Cyborg. - Error. Error. Insufficient energy. Come on, Victor. Error. Error. Error. I'm here. Lantern said Orm confessed to killing his mother. Yeah, to us. He lied to his people. But you saw it. And you know what that means? You killed her. I did. I ran the sword through her myself as she mewled for peace. You can count yourself fortunate, bastard. At least our mother won't be the impediment to your life that she was to mine. You killed her. - I did. - What is this? I ran the sword through her myself as she mewled for peace. You can count yourself fortunate, bastard. Orm killed our Queen? We are betrayed. No. Wait. This deception is their surface magic. Liar! I was there when Orm boasted of the murder of our queen. It was as you see. I am your king. I did this for you. Is this the king you want, Atlanteans? A coward who lies to you? You need a light to guide you in the darkness, people of Atlantis. My people. What are you doing? Becoming a beacon. I was born of two worlds. Atlantean by birth. Human by instinct. Join me and we will bridge those worlds in peace. How is that? Let me check. Run system diagnostic. All systems operational. Seems okay. I mean, how does it feel? Feels good. Vic, we gotta go! - Whoa. Am I interrupting? - Yeah, you are. But we can pick it up tonight. Over dinner? I'd like that. That's what I'm talking about. - Victory. Victory. Victory. - Not cool, man. Not cool. He looks happy. He has found his place. Are you free later? If I can find my glasses. We're standing in the middle of Atlantis. I am totally geeking out. Man, we have a weird job. We need to consider solidifying this team. Like weekly meetings? Yay, we're a book club now. Batman's right. New threats are springing up daily. Agreed. Someone should be watching. It's funny you say that. I've been working on plans for a watchtower. You can count on me. Hal? Yeah, all right. I don't wanna miss whatever weird crapola comes next. We should invite Arthur. I'm in. He needs a codename. Yeah? Well, online, they're calling him "Aquaman." Hate that. Aquaman it is. You won't be too busy as king? I have seen the pressures of the crown. I'll make it work. I should keep a foothold in both worlds. Besides, it'll help repair relations if I'm seen helping out. Well said. You are a gifted leader indeed. My liege, trenchers have been spotted at the edge of the city. Finally. I've been itching all day for some action. Hey, let me know when the next meeting is. I gotta do some king-of-the-sea stuff. Perhaps you should stay behind me. I'm the one with the trident. Perhaps you should stay behind me. You cannot keep me here. I am of royal blood. You will let me speak to my brother! I am Lex Luthor. I have a proposition for you. CHECK THE ARTLINE. Est-ce que vous hyperventilez le patient? Non, Docteur. READY THE BONE WAX. METZENBAUM SCISSORS. METZENBAUM SCISSORS. Dégagez moi ce chat. Oui, monsieur. READY TO CLOSE. REMOVE THE WEITLANDER RETRACTOR. Female Nurse: WE'RE CLOSING, DOCTOR. REMOVE THE RAINEY CLIP, FOR GOD'S SAKE. I APPRECIATE YOUR LETTING ME OBSERVE THAT BRAIN OPERATION TODAY. IT WOULD'VE BEEN MORE COMPLICATED IF HE'D NEEDED ONE, BUT SINCE YOU WANTED TO OBSERVE MY TECHNIQUE, I- THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU. DOCTOR, WERE YOU, UH, WERE YOU INTERESTED IN SCIENCE AS A CHILD? I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS INTERESTED SO MUCH IN THE SCIENCE AS I WAS THE SLIME THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. SNAKES AND FROGS. WHEN I SAW HOW SLIMY THE HUMAN BRAIN WAS, I. I KNEW THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, TIMON? I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FISH. THEY TASTE FUNNY. REALLY? IT'S FRESH. IT CAME RIGHT OUT OF THAT TANK. YOU HOOKED MY ANGEL FISH?! WHY DO YOU DO THESE TERRIBLE THINGS? BECAUSE I LOVE TO SEE THOSE VEINS IN YOUR TEMPLE THROB. YOU-YOU- I'LL KILL YOU. LOOK HERE, YOU DEVIL WOMAN, YOU'LL NEVER DO THIS TO ANOTHER MAN! OH, YES, I WILL. I'LL DO IT, AND I'LL DO IT, AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. WOULD YOU READ THAT BACK TO ME? I'M AFRAID THAT MIGHT MAKE ME SOUND POMPOUS TO YOUR READERS. UH, "MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION "IS UNSURPASSED AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY." NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." IT MAKES ME SOUND WISHY-WASHY. YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME, YOU IMPOTENT PRUNE! OHH! MY RENOIR! I'LL KILL YOU! I GET SO EXCITED WHEN YOU GET ANGRY. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO THE READING OF THE WILL. YOU WON'T GET A PENNY. I CHANGED MY WILL MONTHS AGO. YOU SON OF A BITCH. WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND ME A NEW MAN TO TORTURE. DR. FURRIER- THAT'S. HFUHRUHURR. I'M SORRY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF PEOPLE MISPRONOUNCE IT, BUT IT SOUNDS JUST THE WAY IT'S SPELLED. H- F-U-H-R-U-H-U-R-R. HFUHRUHURR. HFUHRUHURR-RUR. THAT'S GOOD. YOU JUST WENT A LITTLE PAST IT THERE. JUST PUT THE BRAKES ON A LITTLE SOONER. DOCTOR, I, UH. I KNOW YOU WERE QUITE SHAKEN BY THE TRAGIC DEATH OF YOUR WIFE.

I DON'T FIND THIS AMUSING, GARRERO! THIS IS A BETTER STORY THAN I EVER HOPED FOR. BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GETS HIT BY A CAR AND NEEDS BRAIN SURGERY, AND THE MAN WHO HITS HER IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST BRAIN SURGEON WHO OPERATES ON HER AND SAVES HER LIFE. IFI SAVE HER LIFE, OLSEN.IF. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, DR. BRANDON? AH, YES, MICHAEL. THIS OPERATION THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO PERFORM, I FEEL, IS VERY ILL-ADVISED. NO SURGEON SHOULD EVER OPERATE ON A PATIENT THAT HE HAS PERSONALLY INJURED. IT WOULD MAKE HIM TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED. DON'T YOU THINK I'M AWARE OF THAT? BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON I'D TRUST TO PERFORM THIS OPERATION-BECKERMANN. DR. BECKERMANN WAS MURDERED IN EUROPE. YOU KNOW THAT. EXACTLY! NOT ONLY IS HE DEAD, HE'S 6,000 MILES AWAY.

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AUSTRIA, MICHAEL? NO. THE AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE OF CRANIOLOGY HAS ASKED MANY TIMES FOR YOU TO LECTURE THERE ON YOUR THEORY OF BRAIN TRANSPLANTS. WHY NOT TAKE THEM UP ON IT? COMBINE A BUSINESS TRIP WITH A HONEYMOON. HONEYMOON. YEAH. I GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET US STARTED. WHEN ARE YOU SCHEDULED TO HAVE YOUR HANDS REMOVED FROM YOUR FACE? 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

MOVE INTO THE BEDROOM, SLIDE MY HANDS OVER HER DRESS, I REMOVE HER BLOUSE, MAYBE 4 OR 5 MINUTES. MOVE OVER TO THE BED, RUB EACH INNER THIGH, THAT WOULD BE 4 MINUTES EACH, SO I FIGURE 25 MINUTES OF FOREPLAY IN GENERAL. DO YOU CALL ORAL SEX FOREPLAY OR ACTUAL SEX? DOESN'T MATTER. I'D LIKE TO DO IT TWICE, SO AT LEAST 3 HOURS, ALL RIGHT? 3 HOURS?! YES, SIR. TAKE MRS. HFUHRUHURR AND THAT LUCKY SON OF A BITCH UP TO SUITE 729. YES, SIR. I NEVER IN MY WILDEST IMAGINATION EVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE LIKE THAT. IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING SEXUAL ENCOUNTER- WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING IT- THAT I EVER ALMOST HAD. DOCTOR, I'M DR. FELIX CONRAD. I'LL BE ESCORTING YOU TO THE LECTURE HALL. DID YOU JUST STEP OFF THAT ELEVATOR? THERE WAS NO OPERATOR. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT VIENNA'S ELEVATOR KILLER? ELEVATOR KILLER? PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING ON ELEVATORS ON ONE FLOOR ONLY TO ARRIVE AT ANOTHER FLOOR DEAD. LIKE BECKERMAN. JA.DR. SCHLERMIE BECKERMAN. A BRILLIANT BRAIN SURGEON. ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. IT WAS A GREAT LOSS. I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. THE ACADEMY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING YOU LECTURE THIS MORNING. I HOPE I DON'T RUFFLE ANY FEATHERS. MY SPEECH MIGHT BE A LITTLE RADICAL FOR THE OLD GUARD. IT WOULD TAKE QUITE A BIT TO SHOCK ANY OF THIS CROWD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I CAN ENVISION A DAY WHEN THE BRAINS OF BRILLIANT MEN CAN BE KEPT ALIVE IN THE BODIES OF DUMB PEOPLE. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? THEY'RE JUST SAYING "MURMUR MURMUR MURMUR." IT'S JUST SORT OF A GENERAL MURMUR? YEAH. MURMUR. OH. YOU MAY MURMUR ALL YOU LIKE- BUT TO MAKE TRANSPLANTATION POSSIBLE I HAVE RECENTLY INVENTED THE CRANIAL SCREWTOP METHOD OF ENTRY INTO THE BRAIN WHEREBY A LARGE SECTION CAN BE UNSCREWED WITHOUT HAVING TO SHAVE THE HEAD. AND AS A SAFETY FEATURE, I'VE MADE IT CHILDPROOF. TO OPEN, YOU PUSH DOWN WHILE TURNING. AND VOIL?, THE HUMAN BRAIN. WHERE IS THIS MAN'S BRAIN? STOLEN! IT'S THE FOURTH INCIDENT THIS MONTH. I WISH TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR AMERICAN COLLEAGUE. THIS DEMONSTRATION IS NOW CONCLUDED. DR. HMFHRUHRR? IT'S CLOSE. YES? I'M DR. ALFRED NECESSITER. WELL, WELL, WELL. DR. ALFRED NECESSITER. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK? A DRINK WOULD BE INTERESTING. I ENJOYED YOUR LECTURE TODAY. WHAT LECTURE? THEY GAVE ME A HEAD WITH 3 LEMONS IN IT. THAT'S WHY I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH. I DIDN'T HAVE TO HEAR YOUR BRILLIANT BUT OLD-FASHIONED THEORIES ON THE HUMAN BRAIN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OLD-FASHIONED"? I'M THE MOST ADVANCED BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY. I DON'T THINK SO. READ THIS ARTICLE. LOOK AT THE UNDERLINED PART. AND LOOK AT THIS. READ THE CAPTION UNDER THE PHOTO. AND THESE- NEWSWEEK, TIME, COSMO. NATIONAL ENQUIRER- DOLLY PARTON WANTS TO HAVE MY BABY. DON'T TELL ME I'M OLD-FASHIONED. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU, DOCTOR! YOU'RE THE MOST BRILLIANT BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY. THAT'S WHY I'M MOST ANXIOUS TO SHARE MY WORK WITH YOU. IT SEEMS YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WHO MIGHT UNDERSTAND IT. AND I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID HERE. "MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION "IS UNSURPASSED AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY." I TOLD HIM TO TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." MY LABORATORY IS SET UP IN MY HOME. IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT, I COULD SHOW YOU MY WORK. WHEN? NOW! ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY." YOU KNOW, THAT PHOTOGRAPH DOESN'T DO YOU JUSTICE. WELL, HELLO. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE. OW! OH, YOU DIRTY. Necessiter: WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME. BEING IN AUSTRIA AND MEETING A SCIENTIST WITH YOUR INTERESTS, I HALF EXPECTED YOUR LABORATORY TO BE IN A CASTLE, NOT A CONDO. YOU MEAN. LIKE THIS? YEAH. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. JESUS. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY. FROM THE OUTSIDE, IT DOES NOT LOOK THIS ROOMY. I HAD A GOOD DECORATOR. MY WIFE. IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE DID WITH A FEW THROW PILLOWS, SOME WALLPAPER, AND A STAPLE GUN. LEAPIN' LIZARDS. YES. WE HAVE THOSE. MOAT WITH ALLIGATOR. HERE'S OUR SMALL ENTRANCE HALL. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH CLOSET SPACE? THERE NEVER IS. NO. THEY FILL UP SO FAST. THIS IS THE TV ROOM. OH, I LOVE THE WAY IT'S SO DREARY. THIS, DOCTOR. IS MY LABORATORY. BRAINS. I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY BRAINS OUT OF THEIR HEADS BEFORE. FEEL LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE. DON'T TOUCH IT! WHY? THEY'RE ALIVE. ALIVE. BUT THERE'S NO WIRES OR TUBES OR THAT "BZZ" THING. HOW ARE THEY KEPT ALIVE? WITH A SPECIAL FLUID I DEVELOPED. WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL THESE BRAINS?

A TAHITIAN LADY. RIGHT-O. FLAMING? OH, NO, NO. THAT'S FOR TOURISTS. WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR BRAINS? THE CITY MORGUE. FOR A NICE TIP THEY SEND ME BRAINS FROM BODIES THAT HAVE DIED IN THE RIGHT WAY. WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY FOR A BODY TO DIE? FOR MY PURPOSE, AN INJECTION OF 200 CCs OF AMMONIATED STRYCHNOCLORAHYPE INTO THE BUTTOCKS, CAUSING THE BRAIN TO DIE LAST. THANK YOU.

THE ONLY TIME WE DOCTORS SHOULD ACCEPT DEATH IS WHEN IT'S CAUSED BY OUR OWN INCOMPETENCE. NONSENSE! IF THE MURDER OF 12 INNOCENT PEOPLE CAN SAVE ONE HUMAN LIFE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT. WORTH IT? YOU'RE CONDONING MURDER! I'M NOT CONDONING MURDER, SIR! Woman: SHUT UP IN THERE! RESEARCH AND MURDER DO NOT GO TOGETHER! AND YOU SHUT UP! WITH YOUR TV BLARING ALL NIGHT AND YOUR 6 GRANDCHILDREN RUNNING DOWN THE HALLS! I'M SORRY, DOCTOR. THESE WALLS LOOK SOLID, BUT THEY'RE THIN AS TISSUE PAPER. THAT'S TYPICAL FOR A CONDO.

They're doing their part, are you? Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world. Service guarantees citizenship. The bugs send another meteor our way. but this time we're ready. Planetary defences are better than ever. Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks. orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational forces. produce an unlimited supply of bug meteorites. in the form of this asteroid belt. To ensure the safety of our solar system. Klendathu must be eliminated. We break net now and take you live to Klendathu. where the invasion has begun. EXQ uplink on two, one. You're on. - We'vejust landed here on what cap troopers. - Move, move, move! - are calling Big K, - Come on! Move, move! - with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division! - Come on! It's an ugly planet, a bug planet! A planet hostile to life as we know it! Help me! - Come on! Go, go, go! - Keep moving! Get out of here now! Kitten, no! Oh, God! Oh, God! Rico. Rico. Rico! Pay attention. Sorry, Mr Rasczak. Let's sum up. This year we explored the failure of democracy. - Bad boy. - how the social scientists brought our world. to the brink of chaos. We talked about the veterans, how they took control. and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since. You know these facts. but have I taught you anything of value this year? Hmm? You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote? It's a reward, what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service. No. No. Something given has no value. Look, when you vote, you are exercising political authority. You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived. Uh, my mother always said violence never solves anything. Really? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would say about that. You. They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed. Correct. Naked force has resolved more issues. throughout history than any other factor. The contrary opinion, that violence never solves anything, is wishful thinking at its worst. People who forget that always pay. Rico, what's the moral difference, if any. between a civilian and a citizen? A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety. of the body politic, defending it with his life. - A civilian does not. - The exact words of the text. But do you understand it? Do you believe it? - I don't know. - Of course you don't. I doubt anyone here would recognize civic virtue. if it reached up and bit you in the ass. Not here. Come on, let's see if they posted the math final. - Rico, we gonna take Tesla? - We're gonna kill 'em. Remember, all graduating seniors must fill out a 710 form. First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores. Wish me luck. - Way to go. - Good job. Your turn. Hold on. I want to talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet. - Marco. - Hi, Carmen. - What do you hear about Roxy? - She made pilot. - She did? - Oh, yeah. Thirty-five percent. Very nice. Look at that. Thirty-five percent, ladies and gentlemen. Big numbers. - Carl. - Sorry. So, you haven't done it yet, have you? Don't lie. I'm not in any hurry. - Others are waiting. - And? - Did you read her mind? - Don't have to. It's pretty clear what she wants. Yeah, but I want Carmen. - Aw, you got it bad. - Bye, Marco. Hey, don't forget about this afternoon. He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. Get out of here. - Marco's sister made pilot. - So will you. I mean, imagine flying a half a million tons of starship. You gotta have nerves of steel. Yeah, you do. Let's see how yours hold up. You may begin. Aw, come on, it's just a bug. You better put your goggles on. "Just a bug." We humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it just isn't true. This Arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways. It reproduces in vast numbers, has no ego. has no fear, doesn't now about death. and so is the perfect selfless member of society. But humans have created art, mathematics. and interstellar travel. True. But before you let that go to your head. take the example of the Arachnids. a highly evolved insect society. By human standards, they are relatively stupid. but their evolution stretches over millions of years. - and now. - Here, take this. they can colonize planets. by hurling their spore into space. Okay, I think we got it. That's the heart. And here's the stomach. Nerves of steel, huh? Don't think about it. Just go on instinct. Try to visualize it. I see the ace of spades. You know, statistically speaking, you should have accidentally guessed right by now. - Try another. - So my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky. No, luck's not a factor. No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. Who knows? Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution. That's why they do these kind of Federal studies. What-- Cyrano-- Oh, shit. Time out. Oh, he just wants some attention. You don't play with him any more. Cyrano. Go bug Mom, Cyrano. How do you make him do that? Oh, I gave him the impression there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg. He's on a mission to go eat it. Ow! Oh! Get out! Get off my leg! Oh! Carl! I sure hope you don't do anything like that to me. Don't be afraid. Can't do human. Yet. Yeah! All right! - Yeah! Yeah! - Touchdown Tigers. And the score is now 4 1-38. Tigers lead with 2.:46 remaining. here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena. Time out Giants. - Are you all right? - Much better. - Now. - Good. - Yeah! All right! Way to go, team! Hey! Your helmet. So, what are you doing after the game? Well, everyone's going to the dance, aren't you? I don't know. It's my last night as a civilian. - Come on, number 12! Let's go! - Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow. - You're going to the Fleet Academy? - Uh-huh. That's where I want to go! Come on, number 12! Let's play ball! Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend! All is fair in love and war. - Giants! Giants! -Johnny! Yeah! Hut! Hut! Hey, yeah! Giants leading 43-4 1. Just over 4 2 seconds remaining. - Yeah! - All right, let's go. Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush. Perry, fake left. Bertolli, you go long. Rico, flip six three hole. Got it? Hey, Rico? - Hey! - What? You're drifting! Flip six, three hole, on one! Got it? -Just throw me the ball, Diz. - Ready? Break! Break! Down. Set. Tight left. - Screen! - Hut! Yeah! Go, go, go! All right! Yeah! He's in there. It's over. Who said you could grow up so fast, huh? Mom, don't get mushy. This came for you today. I presume, at your request. A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service. Well, you're not thinking of applying? Have you lost your mind? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life. It's a term of service. It's not a career. I just want to get out on my own. see the galaxy for a couple years. Johnny, people get killed in the Federal Service. Who gave you this idea? It's that teacher, isn't it? What's his name? You know the one I'm talking about. - Mr Rasczak. - Rasczak? Silly name. There should be a law against. using a school as a recruiting station. No, Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sort of discourages you. Well, that's good. 'Cause you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it. It's my decision, not yours. - Oh, is that how it is, huh? - Wait, you two. Uh, Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is? No. You wanted to see the galaxy? How about a trip to the Outer Rings? Zegema Beach. Huh? I've always wanted to go there. Good, good. Then it's all settled. Sure. Don't go away. I'm just gonna go see Mr Rasczak. Hey, Rico, do you want to dance? Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen-- Aw, come on. Too bad for her if she's not around. You know, it's sad. After tonight, most of us. probably won't see each other again. So, you still gonna play for Rio? Yeah, looks like. Unless Tokyo lets me start. Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. Johnny, how come we never got together? Can't we just be friends, Diz? Sure. - Thank you. - Good night. Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr Rasczak. Well, you better hurry up if you want to catch him. You're the best. Mr Rasczak! - What is it, Rico? - I want to thank you. Your class was the best one I had this year. Well, it's really not my job to please. I just hope you learned something. Well, I want to join up. I think I got what it takes to be a citizen. Good for you. Go find out. Well, my parents are against it. And I know it's my choice. I was wondering. what would you do if you were me? Figuring things out for yourself. is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make up your own mind, Rico. But I have not been to paradise No, I have not been to paradise Watch the days go by All is fine Don't exaggerate. I'm serious. I think you have really beautiful eyes. - You know? -Johnny. Uh, this is Zander. Yeah, we know each other from the game. - No hard feelings? - No, none at all. We won. Come on, Carmen. It's the last dance. Well, maybe I'll see you at the Academy. Yeah. Who knows? - Good luck. - Zander's going for pilot too. You two have so much in common. Johnny Rico, are you jealous? Well, maybe. You don't have to be jealous. Hey, hey, break it up, you two. There's a place for that sort of thing. I've been thinking, and I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna go for Federal Service. That's great. Carl and I are signing up tomorrow. Come with us. I will. My father's not home tonight. All is well All is well Talk about it Watch the days go by All is well 2 4th century dies I do now, of my own free will. after having been duly advised and warned. of the meaning and consequences of this oath. enrol in the Federal Service. for not less than two years. and as much longer as may be required. by the needs of the Federation. - All set? - Thank you. Fresh meat for the grinder, eh? - So, how'd you kids do? - I'm gonna be a pilot. Well, good for you. We need all the pilots we can get. - Hey, did you get starside R and D? - No. - I don't believe it. - I got Games and Theory. Games and Theory? - That's military intelligence. - Yeah. Way to go, Carl. Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you. Hmm. How about you, son? - Infantry, sir. - Good for you. Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today. All recruits must report to the Federal Transportation Hub. within 2 4 hours. Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service. Let's make a vow. No matter what, we'll always be friends. I'll go for that. Well, chances are we'll never see each other again. We'll be millions of light-years away from each other. But, uh, yeah, sure. Why not? You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It may look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer, then that's fine. - I won't quit! - I'm telling you, you will. You're not going back. You're going on vacation! I am not going on vacation! I want to be a citizen. It's my decision. I made it. You walk out that door, you are cut off, young man. You understand me? All right, that's it! You are cut off! Johnny, why won't you change your mind? Does citizenship mean that much to you? Well, yeah, sure. Well, I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl. who wants to look handsome in a uniform. - Don't talk about Carmen that way! -Johnny. Your attention, please. Outbound group 1380, all hub 29 connections. - Do you have everything? - Moscow now boarding. - Great. - at bank 8-A. -Johnny. - Be a good girl, hear? - You're late. - My dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Oh. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Yeah, me too. I'm wearing everything I own. I'm sorry your parents were mad. Who cares? The Federation will give me. everything I need for the next two years, right? - You talk to Carl? - Yeah, he left this morning. - Couldn't say where. - Oh, it's exciting, going away. But I'm scared. Aren't you? I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. I love you. Outbound group 94B to Tereshkova-- That's me. Just say it once. Try it on for size. I love you. Don't forget to write. I won't. Fully automatic Morita. Who wants to hold it? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Citizen rule. People making a better tomorrow. A murderer was captured this morning and tried today. Guilty. Sentence.: death. Execution tonight at 6.:00. All net. All channels. If you think you're psychic, maybe you are. Federal studies are being conducted in your community. Every school kid knows that Arachnids are dangerous. However, Mormon extremists disregarded Federal warnings. and established Fort Joe Smith deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. Too late, they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists.: Arachnids. - One, two, three, four! - Ten-hut! - One, two, three, four! - Most of you will not. live to be in the Mobile Infantry. The trouble is, you are not good enough the way you are. Hands at your side! Chin up. I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim! Suck in that gut! Feet together! To think this had to happen to me. What a bunch of apes. No, strike that! You don't rate that good. Never in my life have I seen-- Do you think I'm funny? Do I make you laugh? - Do you think I'm a comedian, son? - I'm sorry. The first words and the last words out of your stinking holes will be "Sir"! - Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir! You see that armoury? Run around it. Run, I said! Run, run, run! - Bronski, keep pace! - Move! Move! Now, anytime you think I'm being too tough. anytime you think I'm being unfair. anytime you miss your mommy, quit! You sign form 1240-A, you grab your gear. you take a stroll down Washout Lane! Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir! - Pathetic! I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch of you. Now, who here thinks they got what it takes to knock me down? Sir! I guess maybe I do, sir! Ow! God! God! - You all right, son? - Sir, yes, sir! It's my arm. I think it's broken, sir. - Medic! - God. Pain is in your mind! - Who's next? - Sir! Recruit Flores reporting for duty, sir! You specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training unit? Sir, I heard it was the best, sir! It is the best. But what makes you think you're good enough? Now that's the kind of gal who makes squad leader. That's my job you're talking about. Come on. - Here we go! - Here we go! - Roughnecks! - Roughnecks! - On the go! - On the go! One, two, three, four. one, two, MI! You know, I'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim. - Whoa, improper attitude! - Watch it. - They'll kick you out for talking like that. - Bye-bye. There you go down Washout Lane. Yup, you either got what it takes, or you don't. - Hey, there is a line. - Wait your turn, Ace. Hey, at ease, little soldier. It's all the same muck. Get in line like everyone else. You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies. What do you say? Oh-oh, that is no way to act. - I'm honoured. - Hey! Of course you are. Everybody should have a friend like me. Come on, Ace. Back of the line now! Back of the line! - Back, back, back, back! - All right. Hurry up, hurry up. - What a jerk, man. - Tough guy. Hey, Rico, want to sit together? No thanks, Diz. What's your malfunction, Rico? You are. I joined up to get out on my own, and you had to tag along. You think I joined the Mobile Infantry because of you? You saying you didn't? Hi. Forget about it, Ace. You don't stand a chance. What makes you even think you're gonna make squad leader, Rico? - Something I got, you don't. - Ha! -You rich kids are all the same. -It isn't about that. - It's about who's the best. - Hey! Third squad! If someone's hurt, put him on your back and take him out of there! Let's go! Go, Simmons! Go, go, you sissy! Sir, I don't understand. Who needs a knife in a nuke fight, anyway? All you gotta do is push a button, sir. Cease fire. Put your hand on that wall, trooper. Put your hand on that wall! Damn it. The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand. Medic! Hand me that towel, will you? Ah, well, we all have one thing in common. We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infantry. - Breckinridge, what's your excuse? - Oh, my family's all farmers. I hate farming. I mean, uh, Mobile Infantry-- It's like pure picnic by comparison. All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, huh? - And pretty! - I like big! - Djana'D, what about you? - Oh, I'm going in for politics. and, you know, you gotta be a citizen for that. - So here I am. - Ah, you want some responsibility. - Yeah. - Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'. I got into Harvard, but my father says forget it. It's gonna cost an arm and a leg, you know? So, if I serve, Federation pays my way. I want to have babies. You know, it's a lot easier to get a licence if you've served. - So-- - I'm going career. - Officer's training. All the way. - Ah! Future Sky Marshal. All right, Rico, your turn. Who asked you to be so nosy? What? I'm the-the bad guy? I'm gonna be a writer, you know? A writer's got a right to be nosy. Hey, Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires. - What's his story? - Oh, uh, he's here because of a girl. Oh, Rico! Lover boy! - He's getting me excited. - He's gonna blow. Is it you? This is where we live. It's not much, but it's home. Right there, that's my bunk, where I dream about you every night. Boot's pretty tough. Sometimes I think I won't make it. But then I think about what you're doing, and I try harder. - Hey, guys! Do you mind? - Try harder, baby, try harder! Who knows? They might even make me squad leader. Uh-oh, I better pack it in. Oh, I love you, baby, I love you! - Write me! - I love you so much - I'm gonna kill you guys! - I love you so much - Bye! Write me. - Bye! Orbit in five, Ibanez. First one there gets to fly. - Locking it down. - Wait! Wait! Oh, no. Not Ibanez again. She's crazy! Ready, go! Yeah! Deploying wings. How come you're in such a good mood, huh? 'Cause today I get to fly that. Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am. Take the number two chair, Ibanez. - Yes, ma'am. - You see that? - Identify. - Ibanez, T-3 25-A, clear. What are you doing here? I'm the guy whose gonna teach you to fly this crate. Oh, Assistant Instructor. Should I call you "sir"? - Only when I give you an order. - Prepare for departure. It's amazing, us running into each other like this. - Maybe it's fate. - Maybe not. Heard about this crazy girl coming through the Academy. Solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. And when it turned out to be you, I just made sure that we would run into each other. Rodger Young cleared for undocking and departure. All right, Ibanez. - Take her out. - Yes, ma'am. All systems go. In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. Well, this isn't simulation any more. so take her out easy, cadet. Yes, sir. Five metres from object. Three metres from object. Clear. - Don't exceed port speed. - Or what? Or they revoke your flight status, and mine. Your career is in my hands. Steady as she goes, Number Two. - Prepare for warp. - Yes, ma'am. Number One, design for Jupiter orbit. All crew, all sections, stand by to cut in C-drive. - Star drive in five, four, - Five, four. - ready. - three, two. - steady. - one-- - go! We're going in! Move! Man, they're defended. No way in. - Flip six, three hole. - What? You run a flip six, three hole play, and you can score. - Cover me. - You got it. Now! - Thanks, buddy. - Bastard! Yeah! Kid's got some moves. Give him a squad. See what he can do. Kitty, Kitty. Someone's got to teach you guys how to play some pool here. Look at him. Have you ever seen anybody so pleased with himself? Well, Zim must have had to choose someone to be his brownnose. All right, where were we? Okay, watch and learn. Watch and learn. I couldn't have done it without you, Diz. Friends? Friends. - Mail call! Levy! - Yeah, that's me. - Shujimi! - Here. - Rico. - Here. - Breckinridge! - Yeah, right here. - Niler. - Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad. That's all, folks. Hi, Johnny. I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but, uh. - Oh, Rico, - it's been really busy. - you don't deserve that! - Shh, shh. - They've really got us going here. They must have made you squad leader by now. And if they haven't, tell 'em to talk to me. See? All it takes is the love of a good woman. - Yeah. - That is a woman. - Beautiful. - Look at that. - Look at those. - Stop it. - Isn't it beautiful? - I'm dying. I love it out here. - That's also the problem. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Because I think I'm gonna go career. I want to command a ship of my own. And you know. I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room. for you and me, Johnny. - Oh, God. -Jeez. I know that's not what you wanted to hear. But, uh. I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry. Write me, all right? Write me so that I know we'll always be friends. - Let's get back to the game. - I feel so sorry for Johnny. Funny how they always want to be friends. after they rip your guts out, huh? Yeah. Well, it's what I deserve. What are you talking about? Oh, I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. What are you talking about? You made squad leader on your own. And, hey, you still got me to kick around. Fun and games are over, children. You will be firing live ammunition. in a simulated combat environment. You will exercise extreme caution on my assault course! - Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir! Rico, take 'em out! First fire team with me. Next team in ten seconds. Maximum score has been 2 80. - I expect you to do better! - Go! Shujimi, stay down! Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge, clear my line of fire! It's my helmet! It's all screwed up! You're gonna blow the score! - Damn! - Dumb shit! Diz, stay put! What's the problem? - Damn thing keeps getting in my way! - Give it to me. How come whenever something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge? It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb! Yeah, right! Medic! Rico, you are relieved of squad command! Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet? Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction. and I asked him to show it to me, sir. Are you rated to repair the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico? Sir, no, sir! Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet. during a live fire exercise? Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir! I wanted to win, sir! Carry on. Sergeant, we've already lost two recruits over this incident. Do you think there's any possibility of salvaging this man? Yes, sir, I do. All right. We'll try administrative punishment. Prisoner, halt! Bite down on this, son. It helps. I know. For incompetence of command. for failure to abide by safety regulations. during a live fire exercise. for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate. recruit trainee John Rico. is sentenced to administrative punishment. Ten lashes. You may carry out the sentence. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! All sections secure. EBS is high normal. Switching to slave on my mark. Mark. Thanks. You read my mind. Oh, third watch always seems to last forever. I don't know. It depends on who you're spending it with. Something's wrong. - There. - No, I replotted the course. - It's more efficient this way. - Three weeks aboard a starship. and you think that you can lick my navs? Check it. You know, I was talking with Captain Deladier. and, uh, she said-- Don't change the subject. Am I right? Yeah. Yeah. You're right. So, what did the captain say? She thinks that we ought to team up officially. and crew for her. - You and me, huh? - We're good together, Carmen. We're way ahead of the curve in every department. I can anticipate you. You know what I want. No. What do you want? There's a gravity field out there. - Run a scan. Sensors on. - There. - Gravity at 225 and rising. - Report. Captain, we're in the path of an unidentified object. moving toward us at high speed. Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am. - Impact, six seconds! - Emergency evasion! Three, two, fire! Close compartment 21! Where'd it come from? It came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am. Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way. Communications are down, ma'am. They're gone. - Damage assessment. - Hull's compromised. We're lucky to be alive, ma'am. Luck didn't have anything to do with it. We have a hell of a flight team. It really stinks, you going. Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry will just have to get along without me. I don't get it, Rico. You took your licks. If they didn't want you, they would have kicked you out. Hey-- I joined up for the wrong reasons. I got a guy killed. I figure that kind of proves I don't have what it takes. Rico, your call's going through. Take it there. - Hello? Oh, Johnny! - Hi, Mom. B-Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny! -Johnny? - Dad. - Where's your uniform? - Bill. It's just good to hear from you. How are you, son? It's not really working out here for me, Dad. I was thinking-- I was hoping it would be all right if I came home. Well, of-of course. You should come home immediately. I'm sorry. I've been an idiot. Don't talk like that. You just come on home. talk things out. We love you, son. - My, what's that? - Looks like rain. - This time of year? - Sure is dark. Your transmission has been terminated. due to atmospheric interference. Please try your call again later. Sanchez! Well, see ya. Hey, you take that stroll down Washout Lane. you're only proving one thing,Johnny. What's that, Diz? That you don't have what it takes to be a citizen. Mobile Infantry is passing by Mobile Infantry is passing by - Well, sound off - MI - Sound off - Passing by - Count now - One, two, three, four - That's it! That's it! - Left. Left. - Left, right, left. - Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir! - I can't hear you! - What's going on, you guys? Move, move, move! What's happening? Hey, hey, what's going on? Wh-What's going on? - Hey, Kitten, what's going on? - It's war! We're going to war! The devastation we are seeing is unparalleled. Judging from early estimates, millions dead, a city in ruins. Is that Geneva? Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny. The meteor was shot out of orbit by bug plasma. that derived from Klendathu, the Arachnids'home planet. Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise. Oh,Johnny, it's us. Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth. That's home. The Federal Council met moments ago and voted unanimously. for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat. - I'm serious. I'll go anywhere. - Forget it, Zim. We need you here. -I want combat, sir. -The only way you're gonna see combat. is if you bust yourself to private! - Get me? - Yes, sir, I get you. - Sir! - What do you want, Rico? I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. You already signed your 1240-A, son. - It wouldn't be legal. - Major, I know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake, and I made another, sir. You made your decision, son. Sir, my family, my whole family, was in Buenos Aires, sir. Is this your signature, Rico? Sir, yes, it is, sir! Doesn't look like it to me. - Carry on, Private! - Yes, sir! Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow. then anger. The only good bug is a dead bug. In Geneva, the Federal Council convenes. We must meet the threat with our valour, our blood. indeed, with our very lives. to ensure that human civilization, not insect. dominates this galaxy, now and always! Sky Marshal Dienes announces plans. for an offensive against Klendathu. source of the bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires. Every day, Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs. Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart. but you can blow off a limb. and it's still 86 percent combat effective. Here's a tip.:Aim for the nerve stem, and put it down for good. Everyone's doing their part. Are you? - Die! Die! - The war effort needs your effort. at work, at home, in your community. We now break net and take you live. to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga. deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone. where the men and women of the Federal Armed Services prepare to attack. D XQ uplink on two, one. You're on. No one here in the AQZ knows exactly. when the invasion of Klendathu will occur. But everyone's talking about it. and the talk says tomorrow. Here's a bunch of MI kids that look like they could eat bugs for lunch. - Yum, yum, yum. - So, trooper, you're not too worried about fighting the Arachnids? Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, you got a lot of dead bugs. -Am I right? - I just hope it's not over before we get some. - Okay, come on. - Some say the bugs were provoked. by the intrusion of humans into their natural habitat. that a "live and let live policy" is preferable to war with the bugs. Let me tell you something. I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all! - Yeah! - Go on, trooper! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Oh, yeah! Big bad bugs, huh? Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos. - Hey, let's all get cut together. - Yeah. - What do I want a tattoo for? - Oh, what? Your skin's too pretty? Come on, everybody's doing it. Hey,Johnny! Johnny Rico. Carmen? Oh. At ease. Guess I ought to lose the hat when I'm off duty. - Hi, Diz. - Carmen. My mother was right about you. You look great in a uniform. You look pretty good yourself. So, what do you hear? You know about anyone who made it out of BA alive? Most of the time I don't think about it. Like it happened to someone else. Then it hits me, and I, uh, can't stop crying. Well, we're still alive. Got to be happy about that. You don't look very happy to see me. Should I be? Johnny, it's different now. We're at war. I mean, I think what I did was probably the best thing for both of us. Everything copacetic, Lieutenant? Zander, you remember Johnny. Zander and I are a flight team now. Yeah, and we're best in the fleet. I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. - Don't do me any more favours. -Johnny, wait. No, forget it, Lieutenant. He's Mobile Infantry. See, when you're trained to kill. it just doesn't pay to be polite. You got something to say about the Mobile Infantry? I think you heard me. You want to make something of it, Private? Not with an officer. No, sir. - The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers. - Well, let's disregard rank. - Zander, please. - Let it go, Rico. - Let it go. Everybody hear that? Rank is not an issue here. - Don't do this. - Come on. What's he gonna do? Come on, jarheads! Let go of me! Come on! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you! - Guys! Guys! Quit it! - Come on! Come on! - He's not worth it! - Come on! - Come on! - Let's get-- - Come on! Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix. Come on. Come on, let's go. Jarheads. - Mobile Infantry rules! - Yeah! Oh, God, that hurts. Hey, well, I got something that might hurt just a little bit more, buddy. Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight, and we're gonna win! - Yeah! - Yeah! This is the captain speaking. All personnel prepare for drop. We are at D-minus three and counting. We are going in with first wave. Means more bugs for us to kill. You smash the entire area. You kill anything that has more than two legs. - You get me? - We get you, sir! -Plasma, ma'am, from the planet. -Bug batteries. According to military intelligence, it'll be random and light. - Drop status? - Drop is. 35 percent complete, ma'am. Steady as she goes, Number Two. Remember your training, and you will make it back alive! This isn't random or light. Someone made a mistake. That's it. We're empty, ma'am. Someone made a big goddam mistake! Break for high orbit! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Johnny! - Rockets up! - Rocket crew, move up! - Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico! - Heat 'em up! - Set. - Fire! Down! - Follow me! - Let's go! First platoon, left flank! Split up! First and second squads, follow me. Two, cover! One, with me! Along side! Side to side! Fire! Here they come! - Ace, what are we doing? - Uh, I don't know. - I don't know. - Kill them! Kill them all! Come on! Come on! Come on! You want some? Here's some! Yeah! Here's some of this! Oh, my God! Shujimi! No, no, no! Help! Help! Help! No! God! Let's get out of here! Fall back! Mayday! -All units, - What's going on? - fall back to retrieval. - Repeat. - You got com? -All units. - fall back to retrieval. - It's a general retreat! - Back to the boats! - Come on! Come on, let's go! We've just landed here on what cap troopers. are calling Big K. with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug planet. A planet hostile to life as we-- Help me! Squad right! Come on! Go, go, go! Get out of here now! - Watch your step! - Watch your flank! Watch your flank! GXR, we're being overrun. Kitten, no! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Crisis for humankind. Fleet officials admit they underestimated. the Arachnids' defensive capability. Accepting responsibility for Klendathu. Sky Marshal Dienes resigns. His successor, Sky Marshal Tahat Meru. outlines her new strategy. To fight the bug. we must understand the bug. We can ill afford another Klendathu. Federal scientists struggle to explain. the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids. When a colony reaches a certain size. 300 generations or something, it gets smarter. - Insects with intelligence? - Now, wait-- Have you ever met one? I can't believe. - I am hearing this nonsense. - Would you just wait a moment? - This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had. - Maybe-- Maybe. there is some kind of bug that we haven't seen yet.: a leadership caste, a-a hive brain. Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive! Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector. Affirmative, Rodger Young. One-zero-zero-niner-five-two. Welcome back. My God. How could this happen? We thought we were smarter than the bugs. Give me something, please! It hurts! Be right with you. Help me. It's strange. There's almost no wounded at all. Bugs don't take prisoners. Oh, no. Look. - Carmen-- - See it? Right there. - There he is. - Come on, we'll just wake him up. Hey,Johnny! Hey! - Hey, Rico! - Hey,Johnny! - Hey, Rico! - Wake up! - How you doin', fish boy? Hey, look. You're dead! Killed in action! - Three more days. - Three days. - And you're out. - Good as new. See you later. Bye. So what do you hear about our new unit? Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit on Big K. Yeah, well, I hear their lieutenant's a real nutbuster. Who's top kick? You want the job, huh? I wouldn't mind. I would. Just doing my part. Orders. Yours? Where you been besides Big K? - Outer rings, Zegema Beach. - Zegema Beach? - I always wanted to go there. - Good luck. - It's not there any more. - So, I hear your lieutenant's a real nutbuster. No one talks about the lieutenant that way. - He saved my life. - Mine too. - Same for me. - Me too. Well, sounds like he's quite a guy. Who do you think saved your ass? Stand by. Attention on deck! This is for you new people. I only have one rule: Everyone fights. No one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you. Do you get me? We get you, sir! - Welcome to the Roughnecks. - Rasczak's Roughnecks! At ease. Listen up. We got a new Sky Marshal and a new battle plan. We're gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu. one planet at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the planet, MI mops up. Carry on. All right. Spread out! Fire teams! You locate a bug hole, nuke it. Watkins, shake out Flores and Rico. Copy that. Move out! First platoon, we're going for that ridge. - Levy, you're with me. - No, I'm in A Squad. I'm going with Rico. Shut up and follow me! Hey, you like that? Fungus-sucking sack of maggot puke! It's dead, Watkins! It's dead! Ain't much to look at after you scrape them off your boot. Bug hole. There. Nuke 'em, Rico! Fire in the hole! Watkins, we're under heavy attack. Position M-4. - Get over here! - Move! - You got a bug problem, ma'am? - Ah, stow it, trooper! Tanker! - Oh, shit! - Come on! Move! Get down! Come on! Stay down, sucker! - Gillespie. - Well done! Call for retrieval. - Medic! - Nice moves. Where'd you learn how to do that, soldier? Back in school, sir. Don't you remember? - I was captain of the team. - Rico? - Sir. - I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or till I find somebody better. Thank you, sir. - All right, saddle up! Show's over. - Way to go, Corporal. - Hey, I need a squad leader. - Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it. I'm just here to fight. What about it, Diz? First sergeant, get your gear in section-- Looks like I'm your girl, sir. - Catch you later. - All right. Listen up! I expect the best, and I give the best! Here's the beer! Here's the entertainment! Have fun! That's an order! This one's for me! Thank you, Lieutenant! Rico! You kill bugs good. Thanks. You knew the lieutenant before the war. What was he like? He was a teacher. Kind of like he knew it all. He always had this little smile. Yeah, well, he don't smile much any more. Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up real quick when your kids get smeared. - Come on, Corporal. - Ah, nah, I don't do that any more. I remember when you used to dance. Come on. Do I have to pull rank? Excuse me, sir. Rico. You once asked me for advice. Want some now? - Yes, sir. - Lieutenant, HQ is on the com. Never pass up a good thing. Watkins. Beer? Ace. So, Rico, what are you doing after the dance? What's so funny? You know, just the way things work out. We finally got together, Diz. I love you,Johnny. Rico! We're moving out. There's been a distress call from General Owen on Planet P. So get your shit wired and report in ten minutes. Yes, sir. Who's that with you? Flores, sir. Make it 20 minutes. Yes, sir. Twenty minutes? We can do it. Whiskey Outpost, do you copy? This is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three. Come in, please. Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost, this is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three. - Any contact with General Owen? - No, sir. Not even the transponder signal. It's these canyons. Go to higher ground, Sergeant. Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost. this is Roughneck 2-0 on-- Look out! Sugar, your weapon. Help me! Help me! I'd expect anyone in this unit to do the same for me. - Rico. - Sir. You're acting sergeant. Move 'em out. You heard the lieutenant! Saddle up! Jeez, someone really humped the bunk. - Watkins. - Sir. Secure this compound. Police these bodies. Yes, sir. Give me three up on the tower, now! - Aye-aye. - OP there! OP there! - Away! - Number Two, police up these bodies! - Stinks in there. - Second squad, come with me on the gate! - Rico! - Churchill, come with me! - Yes, sir. We need retrieval. This place crawls. Get somebody in the communications tent and get me an uplink. Yes, sir. Diz, check it out. - Roger. - Command group with me. Ah, shit. Lieutenant! Dirty bugs came in right while they were having chow. Yeah, this is where they got in. Lieutenant. I think you're gonna want to see this. What do you got, Flores? God, I hate this place. What does that look like to you, Rico? Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir. They sucked his brains out. Open that. Officer on the deck! - Pick up the general. - Gone? Is it safe? We've got to get out of here! - General! - We've gotta-- - Sir! Thank God for you, all of you. You're all gonna be heroes. Every last one of you. - Close that hole. - Yes, sir. I had to evade capture. The security of the Federation was at stake. Fire in the hole! I have operational knowledge of what we're up to out here. - Flores, I need that uplink. - Working on it, sir. - Damn it. - See? - They get in your mind. - Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0. - Look, they did it to Farley. - Do you read? - They got in his mind. - Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0. They make you do things. They made Farley call headquarters. The distress call was a trap. They're just like us. They want to know what makes us tick. They want to know us, so they can kill us. Roughnecks, this is lead. Prepare for attack. - I repeat, we're gonna be attacked. - Where's the retrieval boat? Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0 to Battlegroup. Do you read? - Oh, God! - Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0. We're gonna die! Don't you understand? We're all gonna die! Second squad, follow me! - Control yourself, General. - I can't. I can't. I wish you'd just shoot me. Lieutenant! He's just a little out of his mind, sir. Bugs! Bugs! - Die! - All right. Warm it all up! Everything you've got! - Move! - Come on, you apes! You want to live forever? - Here! - I got bugs! Fire at will! Incoming! Down! No! Hey! - Watch your fire! - Watch casualties! Rico, where's my communication? - Diz, status on the uplink! - Give me a minute. We don't have a minute! Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0. We are under-- - This is Rodger Young. Go ahead. - We are under attack, sir. We need retrieval now! We have Planet Pas clear. This place crawls, sir. We need pickup now! -What's your position? -Come down on this transmission. Inside the outpost? That's crazy! Well, I hope you have a crazy pilot. Out! Lieutenant! Boat coming down, sir! Fall back into the compound! Fall back! Hold here! Hold what you've got! Running low! I'm out! Here! Make 'em count! Make cover fire! Fall back! Move, move, move! Fall back to the boat! Haul ass! - Oh, my God! - Oh! - Get him outta there! - Pull! - Come on! Rico! Rico! - You know what to do! - Yes, sir! Do it, Rico! - Yeah! - Dizzy! No! Ace, help me! Hold her down! Move! Get her into the boat! Come on, Diz! Don't die on me! Let's get her out! Let's go, let's go! Let's go! Get aboard! Tower, let's go! Let's move it, tower! Run! Lift off! -Johnny, I'm dying-dying. - No. You're gonna be all right, Diz. It's all right. because I got to have you. Johnny, don't let me go! Joh--Joh-- Don't let-- Don't let-- This is traffic control. Proceed on vector five-niner-two-two-seven. I think you should know. your friend Rico is back there. Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock. On whose authority, Corporal? That would be mine, sir. I assumed command of the mission. Rodger Young, we have an official request. by the Mobile Infantry to commence bombardment of Planet P. I thought you were dead. I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are. Negative on your request, DeRuyter. The Sky Marshal has other plans for Planet P. Welcome back. MI does the dying. Fleet just does the flying. Hold on. Something's up. Fleet's mobilized for a big operation. Attention on deck! Once somebody asked me. if I knew the difference between a citizen. and a civilian. I can tell you now. A citizen has the courage. to make the safety of the human race their personal responsibility. Dizzy was my friend. She was a soldier. But more than that. she was a citizen of the Federation. Present arms! Order arms! Left face! - Officer on deck! - Carry on. Burial detail dismissed. At ease. - How are you, Carl? - Carmen, good. Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on P. That mission had a very low survival probability. The bugs laid a trap for us, didn't they? Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it? We thought there might be a Brain Bug on P. You knew, and you sent them anyway? We couldn't afford to launch an operation if there wasn't one. You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers. They have more. And every day I have to make decisions. that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. Didn't they tell you, Colonel? That's what the Mobile Infantry is good for. I hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain. The Roughnecks are always ready, sir. I hear they need a new lieutenant. Want the job? I'll take it, till I get killed or you find someone better. Attention. All personnel report to your stations. - Well-- - Prepare for drop in 7 5 minutes. Take care of yourself,Johnny. I'll see you again. Officer on deck! - Who are all these kids? - We got reinforced. Most of them are fresh out of boot. We're the old men, Ace. This is for all you new people. I only have one rule: Everyone fights. No one quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself. Do you get me? We get you, sir! - Welcome to the Roughnecks. - Rico's Roughnecks! Today we're gonna pay a visit to Bug City. We're lookin' for a bug no one's ever seen before. Some kind of smart bug. And it probably knows we're comin'. - Saddle up! - Saddle up now! Come on! Run, run, run, run, run! Evasive action. Get us clear for warp, Number Two. Clear in five, four. - Initiating star drive. - three-- - in five. This is Rodger Young. We're going down Repeat, this is Rodger Young. - Get out! - We're going down. - Abandon ship! Come on! Carmen! Oh! - Zander! - Here! - We've got to get to the rescue deck! - Come on! Captain! Abandon ship. That's an-- She's dead, Carmen. She's dead! Go! Here! Follow me! Ready? Hit it! Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard. Scanning for a landing zone! Checking terrain. Here! - Can you handle that? - Piece of cake. - We've lost the Rodger Young! - What is your position? Flight Command, we have confirmation. The Rodger Young is down. - Oh.Johnny! - This is Flight Command. Please repeat. Please repeat. -Johnny! - We now have confirmation. Rodger Young is down. - I repeat, Rodger Young is down. - Rodger Young just burned up. - It's on the rescue net. - Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard. - Is anyone receiving? - Any survivors? - Is anyone receiving? - Well, they're getting tarred up there pretty bad. - Life pod. Bravo 6-3, two aboard. Is anyone receiving? - Is anyone receiving? - Affirmative. This is Roughneck 2-0. You're breaking up. Say again. - Carmen? - Say again. I'm losing you. Carmen! Prepare for landing. Retros in three. two, one, fire! Carmen. Carmen. - Hey, are you okay? - Uh-huh. Get out. Get out. This is Roughneck 2-0. Are you receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2-0. - Carmen, are you receiving? -Johnny, is that you? - Yeah! - It's me! Wh-What's your position and situation? - Yeah. We're in Bug City, 20 metres underground. Position: south 42, east 118. Situation is-- I repeat. South 4 2, east 118. What's your situation? Over. Carmen. Situation is extremely hostile. I need a squad to pull 'em out! - Direction? - Three clicks, south by southwest. Look out! - What do you wanna do? - You heard the lieutenant. Rescue party! Third squad, come with me! Cancel that! You know as well as I do, she's already dead. Sorry, buddy. Roughnecks, let's move. All right. Why didn't they kill us? They want us alive. We should go this way. A Company's that way. Yeah, but Carmen's down there. Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy, but word has it she's dead. She's still alive. How do you know? - I don't know how I know, but I know. - Listen. You got command, but going off mission-- - That's a serious offence. - Yeah. I think they hang you for that. Roughneck 2-0, proceed on mission. I need two volunteers. One day. someone like me. is gonna kill you. and your whole fucking race. You know what this is? Sure you do. You're some kind of big, fat, smart bug. aren't you? Come on. This is Roughneck 2-0. Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five. Run! Go! Go! - Give me the nuke! - You trying to be a hero, Watkins? I'm trying to kill some bugs, sir! Get outta here! Get outta here! Move! Come on! You like that? You like that? Come on! You want a little more? You like that? You like that? You like that? You like that? You want a little more? Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Carmen. - We did it! - We won! - What's going on? - They got it! Come on! Pull! Pull! Pull! Quiet! What's it thinking, Colonel? It's afraid. It's afraid! - Come on. - Yeah! Carl! Carl! Hey! Well, look who's here. You made it. Good. It was you, wasn't it? You told me how to find Carmen. Well, that's classified. You know, whenever the three of us are together. I feel like things might just work out. I hope you're right, Carmen. We've got one of their Brains now. Pretty soon we'll know how they think. And then we'll know how to beat them. One day it will all be over. and everyone will forget that this was the moment. This is when it turned. And it wasn't the mighty Fleet, it wasn't some fancy new weapon. It was a drill instructor named Zim who captured a Brain. Come on! Who am I? - Yeah! - Zim? He got him! Yeah! Zim. Zim got the bug. Zim got the bug, man! - Good job, Sergeant. - Thank you, sir. - That would be private, sir. - Carry on, Private. - Yes, sir! - Yeah! What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal? Federal scientists are working around the clock to probe its secrets. Once we understand the bug, we will defeat it. We have the ships. We have the weapons. We need soldiers. Soldiers like Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer. We're over the target area now, Captain. -And Captain Carmen Ibanez. - This is the captain speaking. All personnel prepare for drop. Soldiers like Private Ace Levy and Lieutenant John Rico. Come on, you apes! You wanna live forever? We need you all. Service guarantees citizenship. <i>Now that calm and sanity have returned to the textile industry,</i> <i>I feel it my duty to reveal something of the true story behind the recent crisis-</i> <i>A story which we were happily able to keep out of the newspapers at the time.</i> <i>The trouble began- Not in my own mill, I'm glad to say-</i> <i>But during my visit to the mill owned by Michael Corland,</i> <i>Which manufactures an artificial fiber, similar to my own.</i> <i>Corland is a personable young man,</i> <i>Who seemed to have impressed my daughter.</i> <i>He was also anxious to impress me,</i> <i>With the idea that his mill was a sound financial investment.</i> Output is excellent. Six million yards of filament a day. - How many? - Six million. That's right, isn't it, Hill? - Six million feet. - Yes, Mr. Corland. - Feet, of course. - Of course. Good morning. I'm lunching here with Mr. Corland and my father. They're still looking around the mill, Miss Birnley. Would you care to wait in Mr. Corland's off- Um, Michael. Hello, daddy. Good morning, Mr. Hill. Now, now, Daphne, please don't interrupt. I'm having a most illuminating tour. This way? - This way, Mr. Birnley. - Oh, this way. Thank you. - How's it going? - Sticky. - Why, what does he say? - Oh, nothing. That's the trouble. Oh, that's only his "kingpin of industry" act. "Forty glorious years in textiles". Don't let it get you down. I'm sure he'll put up all the money you want. - Sorry. Sir. - Come on. Come on. Of course, it's hardly up to what you have at Birnleys. Quite. Eh, for instance, Sir, if you'd step this way. <i>Mr. Green, perhaps you would show Mr. Birnley.</i> <i>The latest thing you've been working on.</i> Just a moment, Green. Thank you. What's this? <i>I really couldn't say, Mr. Birnley. Mr. Green,</i> <i>Perhaps you would explain. Gladly.</i> Well, it's, uh- Obviously, it's, uh- <i>Mr. Wilkins? Yes, Sir.</i> - Is, uh, this yours? - No, Sir. <i>Harrison?</i> - Yours? - No, Sir. I thought it was. his. Well, does it matter, really? Merely a matter of interest. Fotheringay? <i>Could you spare us a moment?</i> What is this? Don't you know? I think it was a special job. Who for? Come along. Come along. Who authorized it? Apparently you did. <i>Really, Mr. Green, you must know whether you did or did not.</i> <i>What does it matter, anyway? I think you're being very ru-</i> There must be some quite ordinary explanation. It's ridiculous. The thing can't have grown there. Mr. Hill, will you please find out what this is about? Yes, Sir. Green, check with the accounts department. Of course. Take them the order number. Uh, very good, Sir. Right away, sir".3-7-8-2-5. 3-7-8-2-5." "3-7-8-2-5. 3-7-8-2-5." <i>I'm so sorry. I really shouldn't start asking questions.</i> - On the contrary. Shall we lunch? - Yes. - I think you've seen just about everything. - Yes, I think I have. "3-7-8-2-5." Here it is. Â£4,000? But spent on what? Hydrogen, Sir. Heavy hydrogen. This is absolute nonsense! Oh, for heaven's sake! I want to aim at materials and designs, Combining the strength and simplicity. Of the old english hand loom weavers, with the color and fire. Of the flemish or provenÃ§al. - Now, if I had an extra hundred thousand - Ahem. - Excuse me, Sir. - After lunch, Hill. - It's very urgent. - After lunch, Hill! Where was I? Well, you mustn't let us keep you from anything vital. No, it's nothing. Nothing. What is it, Michael? It's nothing. Excuse me, will you, please? So I told him. - Mr. Wilkins! - Yes? <i>Mr. Corland wants you. He's in accounts.</i> <i>Mr. Harrison!</i> They want you, too, in accounts. Excuse me. Could you tell me where Mr. Corland is please? <i>Stratton! Mr. Corland wants you!</i> <i>No, Mr. Corland, you're not firing me. I resign.</i> I'm not a cheat, nor a swindler. I did what I did because there was no other way. I may have had just a menial job here, but at cambridge, They gave me a first and a fellowship. I would be there still if they hadn't been so shortsighted. Just as you are and all the others I've worked for. But one day, there'll be someone with real vision. I shall have a laboratory given to me. A proper laboratory, with really modern equipment. And assistants of my own. No, don't interrupt me. It's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress. <i>But this is too big a thing, bigger than you-</i> I see you've been discharged from your last six positions. - Seven. - Oh. Oh, well, perhaps a change in environment might- Oh, no, it must be a textile mill. - I see there's a vacancy at the Birnley mill, but - Birnleys? - Yes, but. - They have a research lab, haven't they? I'm afraid this hardly suits your qualifications. - They want a works laborer. - Oh, that'll suit me. - That's a nice place to leave it, isn't it? - Sorry. - Sorry. - Don't mention it. - You've got it loaded too heavy. - Have i? You want to leave it so you can see over the top. Oh. Yes, of course. Thanks. - New, aren't you? - Uh, yes. - Never worked in a mill before? - Oh, yes, several. I know. Leave school, Into the first blind alley job that comes along. Too old for that. Into another and another. By the time you're 30, what are you? Flotsam floating on the flood tide of profits. There's capitalism for you. It wasn't quite like that. I got a scholarship to Cambridge. But you hadn't got the old school tie. Oh, you can't tell me. Discrimination. I've seen plenty. Where were you going with this lot? The loading bay, I think they call it. You were going the wrong way anyhow. It's down there. <i>Tea up. Better leave it.</i> Oh, tea? No thanks. I think I'd rather- Tea break! We had to fight for it. Just a moment. Look, uh, we'd better help you with it. It's very delicate. Yes, Sir. Pete, give us a hand with this. And get these gentlemen some overalls. Well, where's sid? Sid! <i>Sid! No, no, quite wrong.</i> <i>Sid!</i> <i>Where's it got to go? Up to the lab.</i> <i>It's an electro- And electrola- An electron microscope.</i> <i>Ah, at last! We'd better go and check this over.</i> Mm, it's a beautiful job. No, no! You must have the gun filament off before you switch on the projector, Otherwise you're liable to put 4,000 volts through the cathode. And blow it to bits. Quite. That's the specimen stage I suppose. The intermediate alignment section. This is the specimen stage. Of course. <i>It seems to be all right. If the chief's satisfied, we'll go.</i> I don't suppose you could spare someone for a while, Just till we get the hang of it? What, me? Well, not necessarily you yourself. One of your assistants, perhaps. Well, I see. Well, I-I think perhaps I might manage it. In fact, it might be quite convenient. You sure you're not too, uh, busy? There are a few things, of course, but. If while I'm here, you could let me have a corner of a bench. Oh, certainly, certainly. Uh, see to that, will you, Wilson? I couldn't say, I'm sure. All right, love. Tell her she can pay it friday. He didn't say nothing this morning. Sid, what's all this? Harry says you've quit. - Oh, yes, yes. - Why? - Well, you see, I- - You didn't get sacked? - Oh, no, no, no. - Then, what happened? Well, I've got the chance of another job. - Where? - At Birnleys, too, in a way. - You haven't quit, then? - Yes and no. I got the chance of working in the laboratory. It's a better job. - Oh, yes, much. - And more money? Well, I shan't actually get paid for it. What? We'll see about that. Scab labor. Huh. - The works committee had better hear about this. - But I don't want to get paid. - Not want to? - I don't care whether you want to get paid or not. - You've got to get paid. - Bertha, you mustn't do that. It'll ruin everything. It's only for a few weeks. I promise you. What are you going to do for money? I was going to speak to you about that, Mrs. Watson. I know it's a lot to ask, but. if I could owe you the rent for a couple weeks- Only the rent- I shan't need any food. - You'll not need food? - Oh, I'll get that somewhere. Of course you can stay, Mr. Stratton. Thanks very much, indeed. Sid, are you in trouble? No. Everything's fine. I've. got some money in the post office. Not very much, but you could have it if you need it. I can get most of what I need at the lab. But if there are a few oddments, I'll let you know. Thanks. Anytime. I'm even glad, Michael. You get no money from father. All right. I'm freer to say we'll get married as soon as you like. You're- You're very sweet, but I'm not going to let you. What do you mean, Michael? I wouldn't dream of letting you marry me in a fit of temper. Not until you can do it in perfectly cold blood. Well, I must be off. I have to look around in some other direction. <i>Daddy.</i> I thought you'd gone, Daphne. Father, I know what you think about Michael. You think all he wants is my money. Hmm. Mine. Well, it just so happens you're wrong. He's going to find some other way to do all the things he wants. Splendid! And he still wants me! Well, if you want him, Daphne, Then I'm very glad. So, now will you change your mind about him? Well, if that means- Will I invest in him in spite of what I've seen of his mills- No. Just because there was a lunatic in the place, you blame him. <i>It might have happened to anyone.</i> <i>- In the Birnley mills, for instance? - I'm sick of the Birnley mills.</i> And everything connected with them. And the sooner I leave home, the happier I shall be. Sorry. Hey! Wait! Well, all right. Ah, Mr. Stratton. I don't quite see your point about this. <i>Daddy, just a minute. I-</i> <i>Miss Birnley!</i> Please don't tell your father. You're working for him now. How nice. Does he know? I can't wait to tell him. - Miss Birnley! Look, Miss Birnley! - Get off! Just give me two more days. One even. It's more important than anything. It's going to astound the world! Look. You know about the problem of polymerizing amino acid residues? What did you say? Look. You know what a long-Chain molecule is? - A what? - Do you know what a molecule is? No. Something like an atom? That's it! Atoms stuck together. In this case, like a long chain. Now, cotton and silk and every natural fiber is made up of these chains. And recently we've learned to make artificial fibers with even longer chains, Such as, um, rayon and nylon. You've heard of nylon? Well, I think I've succeeded in the copolymerization. Of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules. Both containing ionic groups. It's really perfectly simple. <i>I believe I've got the right catalyst to promote interaction.</i> <i>Between the reactive groups at the end of the peptide chains.</i> <i>And the carbohydrate combination,</i> <i>While the charges of the ionic groups will cross-Link the chains.</i> <i>And confer valuable elastic properties.</i> <i>At high temperature and pressure-</i> ".And give a molten liquid so that there is a great probability of. "Polymerization. "To give a natural molecule of a length great enough. To confer spinnability". Just wanted something to read in bed. Good night, daddy. Well, after all, how the devil can I do anything about it? What's this? Hey! Here, I need that! Terribly sorry. It's very important. Just a minute. I'm using that. - What's all this? - Where's Mr. Birnley? I've got to see Mr. Birnley. <i>Mr. Stratton, what's the matter?</i> - Mr. Hoskins, it's worked. I've done it! - Done what? The radioactive groups in the fiber-forming molecules. Haven't catalyzed the internal rearrangement. Not in the least. I thought the polymerization would be sterically hindered. But it wasn't. It wasn't. Where are my notes? - Mr. Stratton! - I'll see you later. I've got to see Mr. Birnley. - You can't do that. - I've done it! I've done it! Stop him! Stop him! <i>Don't let him go! Don't let him go!</i> - Nurse Gamage. - I've got to see Mr. Birnley. You're fired. You understand? Fired! You can't fire me. I don't work here. What? That's right. He doesn't. <i>Now then?</i> <i>Ah, sister! Come here.</i> What's the trouble? He's mad, that's the trouble. A strong sedative, that's what he needs. Fantastic. Utterly fantastic. A lunatic, obviously. Yes, Sir. Very odd, indeed. I want to see Mr. Birnley. I can't get any sense out of the rest of them. It's terribly important. Your name. My name, it's. Stratton. Sidney Stratton. I work at the mill. That is, I did work at the mill. Only I- - You have an appointment? - No, but you see, I know that- It would have been better had you made an appointment. Mr. Birnley's busy now. A meeting. But I couldn't make an appointment. Sorry. Write a letter or telephone. There's no question of it. But, Mr. Birnley- It's all very well between these four walls, but what are the shareholders going to say? Â£8,300 for sundries? - What sundries? - Davidson will be here at any moment. Now, he should be able to answer that. <i>Oh, Mr. Birnley's expecting you.</i> No, please, listen. Let me explain! Please! Please! <i>What's all this? Oh, it's nothing.</i> Please give this to Mr. Birnley. I promise you he'll want to see me. I expect my works manager to know everything, Davidson, down to the smallest detail. I should hardly call Â£8,000 a detail. Judging by the job numbers, Mr. Birnley, Hoskins must know. Well, who's Hoskins? Your head of research, Sir. Well, can you find his private number, or is it too much to hope? Oh, do try. How can it be impossible? I've got them here. But- Let me speak to him. - Oh, it's you. - Hello. Have you done it? - Yes, I have, but I- - Come right in. Look. Listen, I'm asking you a simple question. What is it, Knudsen? No, I don't care what his name is. I want to know what he- Very well, then. You must find him and send him up here. No, certainly not. Tell him to go away. What do you mean, you can't? Well, you must know his address. Why, hang it all, he's an employee. Now, look here. He said to go away. <i>- She's gone to fetch him. Really, she has. - Daphne, have you gone mad?</i> I'm in the middle of a difficult meeting. I don't know what you're talking about. How can you if you won't listen? Whatever it is can wait for half an hour. <i>This friend of yours can't be so important-</i> No, don't, don't, don't! Please, don't! Ah, there you are at last! Now listen to me. I will not listen to you. Get out! I won't. <i>Daddy! Knudsen!</i> You're an irresponsible young idiot. Knudsen! Father! And you're a pompous and ungrateful old ass. Oh! - Sidney! - Knudsen! Knudsen! <i>Knudsen!</i> <i>No, father, listen to me. Knudsen!</i> If you think I'd give it to you, you must be crazy, not if you were the last man on earth. <i>Even if I liked you, I wouldn't give it to you if you went down.</i> <i>On your knees and begged for it. Knudsen.</i> I won't stay in your house another minute. Oh! You've made an idiot of yourself, father. And I'm delighted to say you're going to regret it. You need a good spanking. You don't even know what he's done. Well, apart from costing me Â£8,000, what has he done? He's made a new kind of cloth. It never gets dirty, and it lasts forever. Well, that's ridiculous. Oh, it is, is it? Do you know what a long-chain molecule is? Do you know what happens if one makes one of infinite length. With optimum interchain attractions? Do you know what it means? It means that to break the fiber, you'd have to split the molecule. It means, for all practical purposes, it would last forever. And it has a surface charge of static electricity. It repels dirt. That may be nonsense, of course. Maybe he hasn't really done it. Maybe he's talking through his hat. On the other hand, maybe he has. Maybe you're talking through yours. The point is you don't know, And you're too pigheaded to find out. <i>Â£8,300.</i> <i>They're bound to ask questions.</i> <i>Stratton, you're coming straight away with me to see mister-</i> Ah, Hoskins. I've decided to authorize Mr. Stratton. To continue his research here. I'm sure I can rely on you to give him everything he needs. - Yes, Sir. - Well, there you are, Sidney. <i>Well, you've got your contract.</i> And you'll get your equipment. Now, is there anything else? - There is just one thing. - Yes, my boy. I've been thinking about the possibility of. chain reactions. And I think probably we ought to. clear the lab. Clear the lab? Only as a precaution. Secrecy, you mean? Th-That too. You're a shrewd boy. See about that, Hoskins. And you'll see that not a word gets out about this, even in the mills. Well, perhaps we shall have a little surprise to spring on our competitors. Yes. Well, there we are. Shall we try it now, Or do you think we ought to wait until after lunch? Whatever you say. Let's have a go now. Oh, sorry. Mr. Hoskins? <i>Next door. Thanks.</i> <i>Oh, Mr. Hoskins.</i> Good morning. I didn't know where to find you at first. Would you just okay these for accounts, please? It does seem an extraordinary amount. I suppose it's necessary. <i>My dear king-</i> It shouldn't have done that. Accounts have sent us a rough estimate, Sir. Â£18,749. Mm-Hmm. Might be worse. Plus, two thousand to cover the damage to the building. What? Oh, I see. Anything else? Yes, Sir. Radioactive thorium! Well, what does he want that for? What? Shut the door. There's another one due at any moment. What is it all for, exactly? It's a lot of tomfoolery if you ask me. Hello, yes, Hoskins here. <i>Manchester daily express here.</i> We heard there were some accidents in the laboratory. Explosion. I just wondered if there was a story in it. Must be some stupid rumor. Of course, we are making some structural alterations. But that's all. Yes, right. Good-Bye. <i>There's the-</i> Uh-Oh. There go the fireworks again. Good as blackpool, eh, Frank? Someone will get hurt if it goes on. If anyone does, it'll be sid. He's the one who's taking all the chances. And if you was any kind of a shop steward, You'd be getting him danger money. Fat lot he needs it. Jumped out of his overalls into a cushy job pretty fast. And a cushy pay packet too. Well, whatever he gets, he earns all right. It's Birnley's pockets he's lining, or they wouldn't have pushed him into it. And a fat lot they care if he goes through the roof. Me too. Well. here's hoping. I must frankly admit that I'm discouraged. Very discouraged. No one's allowed in, Sir. Yes, I know. Mr. Stratton's orders, Sir. Mr. Birnley's orders. He gave me strict instructions, Sir. I hardly think that applies to us. Well, what are we waiting for? Would you like to? It's easy. No. It must have worked. Were you here just now? Yes. Why? My dear boy, what's the matter? Nothing. It's just that it worked. Do you mean- Just now? Stratton, you should have- Davidson! Oh. We've got it, all right. Look. We've got the answer, Mr. Birnley. We can go ahead now. Fortunately there's a chemical change at 300 degrees centigrade. <i>Hm. Quite remarkable.</i> <i>We shall have to do a little ground work on that.</i> <i>Seven and a half. Seven and a half.</i> <i>- Though as you say, - Thirty-Five.</i> We shall only need to vary the intermediates to make a substitute for. Wool, cotton, linen- Whatever you please. Yes, thirty-One. Thirty-One. And, of course, there's the question of dyeing. Excuse me. Thank you. At the moment, the fiber's intractable. It repels dye just as it does dirt. - But, uh- - We shall have to, uh, Introduce the coloring matter at an earlier stage, Left shoulder. While the polymer is still in the melt. Yes, seven. Seven. You won't find any difficulty in stitching. The needle will simply pass through between the weave as usual. If he could let me have paper patterns of the suit. - Paper patterns? - Yes, I shall have to have, um, Templates made and get the pieces cut out for you. Well, just as you wish. I suppose you wouldn't prefer for us to cut them out? Oh, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to. Come in. - Well, what's funny about it? - It's just the suit. It looks as if it's wearing you. It's still a bit luminous. But it'll wear off. Oh, no. No? No, it makes you look like a knight in shining armor. - That's what you are. - Me? Don't you understand what this means? Millions of people all over the world, living lives of drudgery, Fighting an endless losing battle against shabbiness and dirt. You've won that battle for them. You've set them free. The whole world's going to bless you. Unbreakable? That's what they're saying, Mr. Corland. Green, is- Is that possible? Well, uh, if he's using a heavy hydrogen, He might get a more complex molecule. In plain language- Yes or no? It's, uh, possible. I'm very grateful to you, king. I- I think the. industry will be. Get me Sir John Kierlaw. Now, now, Davidson. Hardly that, surely. Well, as soon as I have finished with the press, I should like to see the heads of all departments. Yes? One moment, please. It's Sir John Kierlaw. Sir John- All right. I'll- I'll speak to him. - He's here. - Here? Michael. So it was- Oh. No, no, the asthma atomizer. Now, some fool. Has invented an indestructible cloth. - Right? - Yes. Where is he? How much does he want? <i>I'm afraid we have Mr. Birnley to contend with first.</i> As I understand it, Mr. Birnley intends to manufacture and market this product. - Certainly. - Are you mad? <i>Well, I consider it my duty to do it.</i> It'll knock the bottom out of everything, down to the primary producers. What about the sheep farmers and cotton growers? The importers and middlemen. The big stores, even. <i>It'll ruin all of them! The point. Let us stick to the point.</i> - What about us? - Well, I'll admit some individuals. May suffer temporarily. But I will not stand in the way of progress. The welfare of the community must come first. You're not likely to suffer much. Michael, that's unworthy of you. Sir John, Surely you realize this is the greatest step forward. Step forward? Over a precipice. It means disaster. Disaster? Was the spinning jenny a disaster? Was the mechanical loom? For those who didn't control them, yes. Besides, they increased output. This will finish it. Just arriving now, Sir. He's the one to make the complaint, isn't he? Well, what's this? <i>- Worker's playtime? - It's sid!</i> Look whose car. - Sid! - Hello, Bertha. - Hello. - What have they done to you? Well, it's really what I've done. - We are just going to announce it to the press. - Announce what? - My new fiber. - Mind! Mr. Corland. In Mr. Birnley's office. It never gets dirty? - And never wears out? - That's right. Now what do you think of him? - And you think they'll go ahead with it? - Certainly. You're not even born yet. What do you think happened to all the other things? The razor blade that never gets blunt. And the car that runs on water, with a pinch of something in it. No. They'll never let your stuff on the market in a million years. <i>He's right, you know. Vested interest.</i> The dead hand of monopoly. It's not like that at all, I assure you. <i>Everything's organized. We're telling the newspapers this morning,</i> <i>And then going right ahead.</i> But if this stuff never wears out, we'll only have one lot to make. <i>- That's right. - I've been looking everywhere for you.</i> First of all, I want to apologize. Didn't recognize a genius when I saw one. Excuse me, Sir. I - I've just come from Mr. Birnley. One or two things he asked me to straighten out. That's lovely. Six months's work and that'll be the lot. Every mill in the country will be laid off. It's Birnley's doing. Sidney wouldn't invent a thing like that. Something oughta be done about it. Something is gonna be done. We'll get the works committee together for a start. I don't want to be selfish about it. Later on, I might be able to offer it to other manufacturers- Under license. You want us to cut our throats. <i>While you build up another fortune in royalties on our dying efforts!</i> <i>Well, after all, may I point out that I control this process.</i> - Do you? - Of course I do. A sordid matter of details, Sir John. - Well? - Stratton's diary of his first successful experiment- September 15. Stratton's contract with Mr. Birnley- <i>October 1.</i> Sir John. I expect he's on his way to us now, but I'll just make sure. <i>The works committee? I'm sorry, Mr. Birnley's busy.</i> No. No, no, no, I can't interrupt him now. No! No! Mr. Davidson, wait! You can't go there! Sir John Kierlaw. Mr. Cranford. - How do you do? - Mr. Mannering. - How do you do? - Mr. Corland you know, of course. This is Mr. Stratton, gentlemen. - What's this? - A new contract. Sign it, young man. What was wrong with the old one? Well, this is a big thing, Sidney. Too big for one mill. And so I decided it was necessary to bring in these other gentlemen. I see. Yes? Mr. Birnley, it's the works committee. They say- - No, no, I'm busy. - It's urgent! It's about Mr. Stratton. Mr. Birnley will see them later. I think it's all in order. Thanks. Oh, that's ingenious. <i>- May I? - Of course.</i> How much petrol as against how much ink? I really don't know. There's just one thing- Wilson, my assistant. He's been a great help on this, and I'd like him to get some of the credit. Of course. We all realize the value of Mr. Wilson's contribution. I mean, when the results are published, I'd like his name to be mentioned. There may be a little delay in publication, of course. Delay? Oh. Why? You see, Sidney, we have to wait till the right moment. - Why not now? - To announce it right away. Might upset the delicate balance of the market. Would it? But what happens when you begin to sell the stuff? Leave these problems to us, Mr. Stratton. <i>- Just sign the document. - Sir John's right, Sidney.</i> You are going ahead with production? Well, Sidney, I- <i>- I'd like to think this over. - Young man, come here.</i> We need control of this discovery. <i>Complete control. If you want twice the amount in that contract, we'll pay it.</i> A quarter of a million. - To suppress it? - Yes. Excuse me. Wait! Now listen, all of you! Sidney! Sidney! <i>Stop him!</i> This is too much no, no, no, wait. Wait, please, all of you. <i>- Yes, Mr. Birnley? - S- S-Sidney, no!</i> - I beg your pardon, Mr. Birnley? - Miss Johnson, there's a room- <i>Stop him! Sidney, stop that!</i> Look here. You can't- <i>Stop a minute!</i> Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! For goodness sake, stop him! Stop him. He- He mustn't leave the mill. - How can we stop him? - By force. - By force? - How else? - I will not resort to violence. If he sells to anybody else, he ruins us all. Then we must reason with the boy. How can we reason with him when he's not here? Yes, Sir? This way, gentlemen. <i>Oh, I'm sorry. Wrong floor!</i> Is he all right? - Yes. - Pity. Any news of him? He's up at Birnley's. What did I tell ya? Right in their pocket. You've no right to talk like that. Perhaps he can't help himself. - They say he had a headache. - Aye, sticks out a mile. Birnley won't see the works committee and sid can't face us. <i>There.</i> Mr. Stratton lives here? Yes, but, uh- Now he's going to live with Mr. Birnley. <i>I've come to collect his baggage. Also, to give you two weeks' rent.</i> Now who's right? It's just as I told you. Sitting right in their laps. <i>- Well, give me some figures. - Fallen to what?</i> 46.9? No, no, no, no. No, don't sell. No, of course not. There's not a word of truth in it. Yes, yes. I'll be on - On here till further notice. <i>Well, that's just the beginning.</i> Hello, yes? Yeah? Calcutta? Tomorrow'll be a nosedive. Just on these rumors. It's absurd. There must have been a leakage. - Well, you should know, you started the first one. - It's no good your blaming me- - You know very well - Sir John's right. Let's keep to the point, shall we? All right, put him on. There's only one thing that will put the market together, And that is a denial backed with suppression - Total and permanent. - Hello, Mottram. - How? We've already offered him a quarter of a million. Well, we can't keep him here forever. There are one or two laws in the country. I've got it. Maybe I should talk to him, let him name his own price. I think not, Michael. I will- Gentlemen! Gentlemen. Knudsen? His door's locked. The key's gone. I have it, miss Birnley. I'm sorry, miss Birnley. No one goes in, he doesn't come out. Mr. Birnley's instructions. There's no sense in pursuing this boy with money! It means nothing to him! - What else could? - Yes, yes, yes. Put him on, will you? Women? He didn't seem to me to be the type. It's often that type that, um- Very true. If we could just find a friend of his. I mean, someone who knew the best way to talk to him. Father? What's going on? What have you been doing to Sidney? <i>Now, really, Daphne, it's no concern of yours.</i> <i>I want to know just exactly what you've done to Sidney.</i> - W- Will you please- - I'm sorry, father- <i>- This is a very important business meeting. - Miss Birnley, just a minute.</i> Stand by the phone, will you? I'll ring you back. Um, miss Birnley, I take it you know Mr. Stratton quite well? How well? We're very good friends. Why not? <i>Why not? It may be very useful to us.</i> I thought I told you- Mr. Birnley? Oh, it's for you. - Hello? - Sit down, miss Birnley. <i>No, Davidson, I cannot.</i> Miss Birnley, We're trying to buy the world rights to Mr. Stratton's new discovery. But he doesn't seem to trust us. Doesn't he? Why not? Miss Birnley, you're the daughter of an industrialist. You must realize how reckless exploitation. Of anything new would upset the delicate balance of trade. You understand that? I am beginning to. Good. Good. You want to suppress it. But, gentlemen, if you aren't able to persuade him, why should I be able to? Uh, all men are susceptible, miss Birnley. I need hardly tell you that you're a very attractive girl. Thank you. <i>Tell them I'll see them tomorrow.</i> <i>Well, Michael, what do you say?</i> It's a desperate situation, Daphne, <i>For the whole industry.</i> Yes. Yes, I'm beginning to realize that. <i>There's no need to explain what's at stake.</i> <i>When I tell you we've already offered stratton a quarter of a million,</i> <i>- You can see for yourself. - I can, indeed.</i> But, since we're on the subject of price, what do I get out of it? <i>- Miss Birnley! - Daphne!</i> I haven't had much experience with these sort of things, But I've always understood it was comparatively well paid. Now, miss Birnley - This isn't anything to joke about. I suggest 2,000. Aren't you rating my value a little low? Wouldn't 5,000 be fairer? - Five thousand. Agreed. - Agreed. - It's a pleasure to do business with you, Sir John. - Well, Daphne? <i>And about time too.</i> I want to talk to you, Sidney. I never thought you would be on their side. You may not believe me, Sidney, but I want what's best for you. I- I don't like this any more than you do. I hate this town. The mill, everything. People who think of nothing but moneygrubbing. - Don't you feel like that? - Yes. I want to get away, Sidney. I want to see something of the world beyond this dirty little town. To make a life for myself where there are people who know the way to live. Italy, maybe. France? Well, why don't you? I can't. But you could. And you could take me. How? I know what they offered you. You could live the rest of your life on it. Go anywhere. Do as you please. And if you want me, I'd come too. What's wrong? I'm sorry. No. Not even if it means me? - No. - Thank you, Sidney. What for? <i>If you'd said yes, I'd have strangled you.</i> Now, we've got to get that suit to the newspapers. Show it to them and tell them the whole story. That will blow the lid off everything, and they'll never get it back on. But how? Would you stake your life on this? You can issue a categorical denial to the press. The stuff does not exist. It has never been invented. It never could be. There is no panic here whatsoever. Certainly Mr. Birnley will confirm that. <i>No, no, no. Good heavens, Davidson,</i> I told you to deal with them in your own way. Yes, Mr. Birnley. - They've come out. - What? - On strike. <i>- Strike? - They've got the whole mill out.</i> <i>I tried to get you on the telephone, but you kept on being engaged.</i> Well, you better get them back at all costs. Otherwise, there'll be a landslide. <i>- Landslide? - Now, Mr. Birnley, I-</i> <i>- Then go and do something! - They want a guarantee we're not going into production.</i> - But, we're not intending to. - Good heavens, man, that's what we're out to prevent. Yes, I know. But they won't take one's word for anything. Oh, this is insanity! They're afraid of being out of work and so they down tools. What am I to do? <i>Get them up here.</i> Up to the house. I'll talk to them. Well, what are you waiting for? But what guarantee can we give them? We don't control the thing. Oh, I don't know. Sir John- It's only a matter of five pence. You're very unreasonable. - Excuse me. - Right? - Can you let me have five pence? No coppers at all. Well, more would do. I've got three and eleven, but I want four and four. I've got to get to Manchester. I could more than pay you back as soon as I've done it. I could give you Â£100. I've got some money at my digs. Better get it then. Kierlaw or anyone else. And Frank'll- <i>It's Sid! Hey! Wait for me!</i> <i>Sid!</i> Sid, I want to talk to you. <i>Can't talk now, gotta find a shilling.</i> Sid, where are you going? Your room's lent. - Where's that vase? - Who are you? Sid, the room's let to some old geezer. Oh, I beg your pardon. What's going on? Will you please kindly leave this room? - Oh, Sid. - Sorry. Sid, I knew you'd turn out right in the end. - They tried to soften you up. - They locked me in the attic. - Oh, you can't tell me. Human life means nothing to 'em, but you got away. I must go now. Don't you worry. They won't get at you again. I'm going up to a meeting there now. Wait till I tell them. What a trump card. Thanks, Bertha. But there's a train to Manchester at 8:13. - Manchester? What for? -To give it to the newspapers the whole story. Here, wait a minute. What story? The whole thing. My invention and how people tried to stop it. But they're not going to. Sid! Whose side are you on? The same as you. Don't you understand? They want to stop it. So do we. Sid, listen. No, Sid. Sid, don't go! Sid- Now, look, Sid. Sid! Will you please stop? Please, stop. Stop it. Stop it. I'll fetch Mrs. Watson. Here, you can't do that. That's my room. Open that door. <i>Let me out of here. Let him out of there.</i> Not likely. All right, I'll fetch the police. Hey! Wait a minute! <i>Let me out!</i> Bertha! What's up? Harry, stay here. Don't let either of them escape. Eh? Sid's gone mad. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's got us all muddled up with Birnley. This is beyond belief, gentlemen. And if Sir John was suggesting. <i>What I could hardly believe he could be suggesting-</i> Now, my dear Birnley, Let your daughter deal with stratton in her own way. - After all, she went into it with her eyes open. - Well, I didn't. Yes? The works committee is here. Oh, well- Well, show them up. <i>N- Now, Birnley- B- Birnley, listen-</i> <i>Who is that?</i> It's me, daddy. Daphne, I-I just wondered if you were still there. Yes, I'm still here. Daphne, I-I want to talk to you. Not now, father. <i>Daphne. Birnley, don't be ridiculous.</i> But she's locked in. Crazy or not, we've got him. We'll get some sense into him. <i>Daphne! Open-Open the door, please.</i> <i>Daphne, open this door. Daphne!</i> No. Knudsen? Ladies and gentlemen, Sir John will now explain to you the situation. We're talking to Mr. Birnley. No one else. Mr. Birnley will be along in a few minutes. He better come now. And we'll do the explaining. You see, the boot's on the other foot now. Now that Sidney stratton's with us. <i>W- With you? That's right.</i> Sidney's apologies. But, from now on, you'll just have to, um, count him out. - Hello. - Hello. <i>Who's that?</i> - Well, what is it? - You know, there's a man in that room. I know that. Well, he's got out. Eh? He went that way. All right. Thank you. - Good-Bye. - Here, let me out of here. Let me- Listen! What are we arguing for? Nobody wants to market it. - Quite right. - My dear friends, You must see that our bone of contention is nonexistent. Capital and labor are hand in hand in this. Once again, as so often in the past, each needs the help of the other. - Mr. Birnley? - Yes? - Can I speak to Bertha? - Who? - Bertha. Is somebody called Bertha? - Who is it? - It's me, Bertha, Harry. - Harry, you. - I don't know how he did it. There were bars on the window. - And the kid said he got out. When I went in, he'd gone! - What! We'll get him at the station! Michael! - Corland? Corland, you take your car, I'll take mine. - Right! - Frank, you're not going with them. - They're not going without me. They're not going to take me for a ride. Wait for me. Wait. <i>Wait. Wait.</i> Okay, ducks. Room for one more inside. <i>There he is!</i> - There. - All right, boys, get after him. The other way! Cut him off! There! Come on, lads. There's a light bobbing up and down over there. That's not a light, it's sid. <i>There he is!</i> Well, cheerio, Alf. There he is! After him, lads. <i>Come on. After him!</i> <i>Hey! What's the matter?</i> Dad! What've you been doing? Nothing. Hello. That way. Here, don't you know there's a strike on? Now, listen, there'll only be trouble if you stay here. It's the stability. It isn't stable. Mrs. Watson, have you got something? My suit, they can see me. Why can't you scientists leave things alone? What about my bit of washing when there's no washing to do? <i>There he is, lads! There he is.</i> <i>- There! - There he is.</i> <i>All right, lads. We got him.</i> <i>The work, it's coming to pieces!</i> We're saved! Look! Look! Sir John! Sir John! <i>Look! Look!</i> Look, it's funny. Look! Here, lad, wear this. <i>The crisis is over now.</i> <i>The news of Sidney's failure brought relief to the world.</i> I see. <i>It had been a hard and bitter experience for all of us.</i> <i>But we faced the future with confidence.</i> <i>We have seen the last of Sidney Stratton.</i> I see. <i>At least, I hope we've seen the last of him.</i> One more. Just one more, please, Dr. Meacham. Hold it, please. A little closer to the wing, sir. A little more profile, Dr. Meacham. He wants to get that faraway, visionary look. Cal, we know how tired you must be. We'll make it as short as possible. Fire away, gentlemen. I warn you, I am beginning to feel faraway and visionary. How about your conference with the committee on atomic power ? Not my conference. Twenty engineers and scientists were there. Hardly a routine meeting, Would you say ? And look, Cal, we won't buy the committee getting you V.I.P.S together for a cocktail party. All right, I'll tell you this much. Under discussion was the biggest job we've ever tackled: the industrial application of atomic energy. That's not news. There've been several industrial reactors in work already. Let us say that in light of recent developments, those plants may already be obsolescent. Electronics is your specialty. How does that fit in with atomic energy ? You boys like to call this "the push-button age." it isn't. Not yet. Not until we can team up atomic energy with electronics. Then we'll have the horses as well as the cart. How long has the army been handing out jets ? One of the boys at lockheed handed me this one. I hope you taxpayers don't mind. Cal, when do we get to this "push-button age" ? When fellows like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs. See you gentlemen later. Cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned ? Roughly. Well, remember me, will you ? I'm concentrating on the reconversion of certain common elements. into nuclear energy sources. Huh ? how's that again ? What counts is how I make it work. I see. Well, good flight, Cal. So long. Thank you. Control tower. Come in. 2XD341, this is ryberg Control tower. Go ahead. All clear, Cal. Drift south about 20 miles per hour. Hi, Webb. what's cal's E.T.A. ? 1410, but he's late. Half an hour late. That's my boss. The only guy in the world who can travel by jet and still be late. When I'm gone. Out me the window. Where are you ? Cal, what's wrong ? I have no control. Cut loose, Cal ! Bail out ! I can't. I'm too low. Jerking around must have caused a flameout. No power. Cal, you okay ? Okay. What happened ? How'd you bring it in ? I didn't. Couldn't. What do you mean you didn't ? Controls went out. Huh ? That's right. No controls, no power. Plane died up there. I should be dead. Cal -- I know everybody's seeing flying saucers and screwy lights up in the sky. Well, you can put me in the booby hatch too. because I saw this ship turn a bright green up there. Are you sure, Joe ? Positive. Did you hear anything ? Yes. A high-frequency howl, very high, all the time your ship was -- Green ? Did Webb see it ? Unless he's blind. Check him. Right. Oh, and, Joe, until we find out what happened, all three of us were blind. How's the little giant ? Growing up. Getting ready to astound the world. Let's take a look. I figured that. She's all ready and waiting. Lowering the cylinder. Increase the rate of reaction. Check rate of radioactive decay. Positive. Same it was the whole week you were away. What did the committee say ? Oh, they were a little excited. A little ! Zero reading. The x-c condenser must have shorted out again. Get the spare. Burned out yesterday. And don't ask me why I didn't order some new ones. I did. X-C condensers in an envelope ? Must be a gag Dreamed up by the receiving department. I ordered two x-c condensers, and supreme equipment sent me these beads. You say they're a gag, but they're condensers. I checked one for capacity and voltage on the meter. And blew it to bits. Yeah, after it held to 33,000 volts and no leakage. If that were true, we could build a generator, One that would supply electric power to run an entire factory. It would fit in a matchbox. It still read 33,000 volts. I'll try one on voltage test. I've got one set up for you. Into thin air. 35,000 volts. Call Pete Knowles at supreme. Okay. Pete Knowles, please. Pete ? Cal Meacham. I ordered two X-C condensers and you sent me some beads. Yes, beads. I am serious. I just tested one bead for voltage, and -- Oh ? well, thanks. Supreme didn't send them. They're crazy. Pete said they've had no condenser order from us in six weeks. Here's a duplicate of the order I sent by teletype three days ago. What's the address on the letterhead that came with the beads ? No address. Look. "dear Dr. Meacham: in place of the condensers you ordered, "we are sending you our AB-619 model. "We are certain it will interest you. Director electronics service, unit 16." I thought it was a subsection of supreme. Electronics service, unit 16. Well, at least we can find out what they're made of. Diamond Drill, the hardest element we've got. The bead isn't even scratched. Experimental lab, wilson speaking. Yeah, sure. Sam wants to talk to you. He's at the hangar. He's been checking over the plane. -Good. Hello, Sam ? Sam can't find anything wrong. Did you double-check the controls ? Of course not. Now look here, sam -- All right, sam, you win. Maybe I did have just a couple, but -- All right. Good night. Maybe I should have had a couple. Morning. Morning. Sign here. Thank you. What have you got ? I don't know. There's no return adDress. "Electronics service. Unit no. 16." "A catherimine tube with an endiom complex of +4." What are they talking about ? I don't know, but this outfit has them. This isn't paper. It's some kind of metal. "Interocitor incorporating planetary generator." "Interocitor with volterator. with astroscope." Here's something my wife could use in the house: "an interocitor incorporating an electron sorter." Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds while it did all the work for her. According to this, there's no limit to what it can do. Laying a four-lane highway at a mile a minute would be a cinch. Cal, maybe we've been working too hard. "Complete line of interocitor parts. incorporating greater advances than hitherto known in the field of electronics." What exactly is an interocitor ? i don't know. and I don't want to know. Well, I do. I want to know what it is and what it does. Order the list of parts on these pages. How we gonna build it ? These symbols -- they're like a foreign language. Anyway, we don't know the address. You ordered the condensers from supreme by teletype. Yeah. Which means that somebody intercepted that order and sent us those beads. Here, try it again. You're too darn smart. I may be the dumbest man who ever walked this Earth, Joe. Here's the invoice. No charge and no address. Listen to this: "No interocitor part can be replaced. Bear this in mind while assembling." Well, let's start unpacking. There's 2,486 parts. Each part is cross-indexed into a symbol pattern. Shouldn't be too hard at all. Sure. A snap, maestro. Only, uh, where do we start ? Right here. You know what my kids would say: "Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing." Plug it in, Joe. We'll see what happens. Now what do I do ? Clear your screen, please. - You. can hear me ? - Of course. Use the intensifier disk, the one in your hand. Place it in position on your right. Now turn the control 18 degrees to the left. You have successfully accomplished your task, Dr. Meacham. You've assembled an interocitor, a feat of which few men are capable. - Who are you ? - I'm called Exeter. I'm a scientist, like yourself. Shall we say a. a colleague. My colleagues don't materialize out of strange machines. They're flesh and blood. So am i, Dr. Meacham, as I hope you'll soon find out, although I admit at the moment, I do appear immaterial. I represent a group which is seeking scientists of exceptional ability. All prospects must pass an aptitude test, which you've just done. I'm flattered, only I don't remember applying for any job. You didn't. I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson. Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog. Images on the interocitor don't register on film. Put it away, Joe. To continue, Dr. Meacham, We test out people without their knowledge. We leave nothing to chance. Except the chance that I'm not interested in you or your group. Come, come, doctor. It's not possible that a man of your scientific curiosity. wouldn't want to find out who I am, where I come from, Wouldn't give his right arm for more examples of our superior technical knowledge. I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham, that you're sufficiently intrigued to come to an immediate decision. We'd like you to join our. team, as you might say, at once. You'll make arrangements to leave immediately. Wait. I didn't say -- at 5:00 wednesday morning, our plane will land at your field. It will wait exactly five minutes and then depart. Whether I'm aboard or not ? Place the catalog on that table with the blueprints. Now stand aside, please. You too, Mr. wilson. Just a minute. Please step back or you may be harmed. Further back. You okay ? Okay. Within reason. If there is any reason around here. There's no reading now. Cal. Yes, Joe ? Whoever that Exeter is, i don't like him. Don't you, Joe ? He was right about one thing. I'm gonna be on that plane. Cal, won't you reconsider ? I did. all night. And, as a committee of one, I came to a series of decisions. at exactly the fifth cup of coffee. One: whatever scientific knowledge this Exeter character has, should be in our textbooks. Two: Joe Wilson, my able assistant, knows enough about a certain experiment to carry on without me for awhile. I'm not sure of that, Cal. Look, Joe, my committee decided I'm expendable. Nothing you can say will change that. You always were an obstinate -- Oh, well, I'm not worried. Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug could fly in here this morning. So no plane is -- He made it. No pilot. No windows. Cal, you'll really be flying blind. Please be seated, Dr. Meacham. And welcome aboard. A seat belt is not required, doctor. Please clear the stairs. Thank you. So long, Joe. I'll be dropping you a card. Cal, get off right away ! This whole thing smells to high heaven ! Cal, I'm beggin' you. Don't go ! Please don't go ! Good morning, Dr. Meacham. Hope you slept well. We'll be landing shortly. Good morning. Good morning. Where am I ? Georgia. I kind of expected Neptune or Mars. Exeter asked me to greet you. I'm Dr. Ruth Adams. Ruth Adams ! But this is wonderful. I never expected -- Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham. Cal. Dr. Meacham, of course. Four or five years ago, conference on thermal problems in nuclear reactors. Boston, wasn't it ? Vermont ! We were lecturing to a symposium of graduate students. Summer, three years ago. After classes, we'd go swimming in a little river near the school. You were an awful sissy about that icy water. Now, Ruth, don't tell me you've forgotten. Dr. Meacham, all I can say is I'm deeply flattered. and maybe a little envious of the girl you've mistaken me for. And now I think Exeter is waiting to greet you. I'm sure you must be puzzled, doctor. I'll never forget my own feelings on the day of my arrival. Exeter isn't exactly conventional in his hiring methods. Or his choice of personnel. I think that sounds like rather a personal dig. Once you're at the club, I'm sure you'll like us much better. The club ? That's what we call it. Exeter has spared nothing for our comfort. or facilities for our work. Inside looks better, doctor. They'll bring your bags in. Your plane. The elevators down to Exeter's slave quarters. Our laboratories. Our living room, social center, library. This is Exeter's office and study. Not exactly what you expected, Dr. Meacham, is it ? Good morning, doctor. Good morning, doctors. Give me your coat. Engelborg, from Munich. The doctor's out for his morning constitutional. He's been here a week, but his English and my German -- Who's that one ? That's Brack, one of Exeter's assistants. But you'll find them all very helpful. What language do they speak ? Anything you wish: English, Hindustani, Congoese. Anything. Dr. Meacham. Good morning. Good morning. Please come in, both of you. Dr. Adams. Sit down. Oh, yes, Steve. About that nuclear decay factor, Ruth. I'm afraid my equation just doesn't seem to work. I was hoping you could find time to go over it with me later. I still think the basic principle is all right. Maybe we can trust -- Yes, well, thank you, Dr. Adams. Oh, there you are, Dr. Adams. I was just reminding Dr. Meacham. that I'd promised to produce some of his colleagues in the flesh. May I use you as exhibit "a" ? I'm afraid Dr. Meacham isn't too happy with me. At the airport, he was sure we were old friends. Obviously, I was wrong. the lady hardly remembers me. What is more important is -- who we are, what we're doing here. Dr. Meacham, I represent a group of scientists. Who work with but one purpose: to put an end to war. Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability: Men of vision, men such as you, doctor, gathered here. Exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success. We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others. I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be. when the world learns of our achievements. Well, there you have it. Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is ? However, let me assure you, doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such, we can accomplish wonders. Well, what do you think of us ? This all sounds great, mr. Exeter, but why me ? Dr. Meacham, we happen to know that you're on the threshold. Of discovering limitless amounts of free nuclear energy. More specifically, the conversion of lead into uranium. Dr. Adams here has been working along the same lines, perhaps just a step behind you, although both of you are way ahead of anyone else in your field. Be careful. Exeter will flatter you to death. The truth is never flattering, Dr. Adams. Now suppose you relax and think it over. Suppose when I do, I find I can't go along with you ? Naturally, we'll expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here. Otherwise, you're free to leave, Dr. Meacham. As free as air. And now suppose we continue your tour of inspection. right from our chairs. Conserving energy is one of our primary concerns, isn't it, doctor ? Your laboratory, doctor. Immediately below this office, I believe. Still under construction, but in a few days, well, we'll have some surprises for you. Brack ! Everything in order ? Yes. Thank you, Brack. Any reason why you can't start in the morning, doctor ? No. Another view of your laboratory. with, uh, your own interocitor, of course. In addition to which, we hope to provide you with -- one of our other units calling, doctor. Other units ? Yes, we have several at strategic points throughout the world. Please forgive me. We'll have a chat at dinner, Meacham. Excellent cuisine, by the way. Like everybody here, the chef must be dedicated to his work. Uh, you'll find the stairway through the living room and to your right. Your room is at the top of the stairs. Thanks. Dr. Meacham, I'm still sorry I wasn't the girl in Vermont. I find, is unsatisfactory. Yes ? Why schedule as planned. Because certain methods imposed upon me by the council have not been effective here. I wish to discuss it with the council. Impossible. The time element will not permit any dissenting opinions. Pplan "a" as instructed. On status of personnel. With the arrival of Meacham, the personnel roster is complete. Proceed with plan "a." What do you think of mr. Mozart, Exeter ? I'm afraid I don't know the chap. My mind must have been wandering. Your composer, of course. Composer ? He belongs to the World. Yes, indeed. The dinner, Exeter, was even more perfect than you promised. Now if you'll excuse me, I could do with some fresh air myself. Would you care to join me, Dr. Adams ? You, Dr. carlson ? Show him the grounds. We won't start cracking the whip on Meacham until tomorrow. That's quite a group Exeter has collected. Quite. That's Dr. Hu Hin Hang. Tang's field is tritanium, the same as Dr. Engelborg. Dr. Marie Pitchner, u-235. Dr. Blorfield, plutonium. Hmm, that puts all of us. in the production of nuclear energy, doesn't it, Carlson ? What are you getting at ? Why no biochemists, electronic experts, mechanical engineers, people equipped to make practical application. of the energy the rest of us produce ? I seem to remember that was part of Exeter's pitch. We try to make it a rule. not to discuss our work after hours. Now how about that fresh air ? How about you and Dr. Adams showing me my laboratory instead ? After all i've heard today, I can hardly wait to add my little contribution. to the good work. This way, doctor. Your lab and my lab are in this wing. Steve and the others are on the right. This is yours over here. It's only Neutron. We call him that because he's so positive. Stay off Dr. Meacham's equipment. Well, what do you think of it ? It's not bad. Should be able to get started very quickly. Fine, but a word of warning. Don't let Exeter push you too hard. He's the kind of man who wants results yesterday. This is the same size lead slab I use in my own lab. I guess you're right. Guess Exeter doesn't expect me to waste any time. This is very interesting. Now, standing here with the lead slab in front of us, The lead reactor panel behind us, we're shielded from nuclear rays. Could be even from the prying eyes of Exeter's interocitor. What's your opinion, doctors ? All right, I'll spell it out for you. You walk around here as if you're scared of your own shadows. Ruth's afraid to admit she and I might have held hands. That's okay, but either i've got to figure I'm a little cracked. Or that Exeter's cat has got both your tongues. We have a right to throw a few questions at you. what are you doing here ? Look, I received a darn fool catalog. I couldn't resist it. I built an interocitor, arrived on that trick plane, and that's all I know. But so help me, in the next ten minutes, I'm gonna know a lot more. I believe him, Steve. Well, I guess I do too. Now we're getting somewhere. To begin with, Cal, I was the girl in Vermont. Then why all the -- because we couldn't take a chance. There's always the possibility you spent a few minutes under one of Exeter's sunlamps. Sunlamp ? That's what it looks like. Only instead of a suntan, you get your brain cells rearranged. Steve had a peek at one. Yeah, it's similar to lobotomy. Renders useless areas of the brain controlling the power of the will. Up until now, Steve and I have been spared. We think Engelborg too, but we haven't the slightest idea why. What about the others ? Try talking to them. Well, that leaves the big one. Who's Exeter working for ? We don't know. All we know is what you've already guessed. Exeter is desperately trying to come up with new sources of atomic energy. And we're the geniuses he's depending upon to deliver for him. Well, he might get a surprise. Why did you wait, Brack ? You should have told me. I was busy elsewhere. If you're so concerned, why don't you let me use the transformer ? The transformer is not the only answer. The council differs. It says it's infallible. The council is wrong. I told the Monitor so today. The transformer is morally abhorrent to the subjects. It sets up subconscious blocks which defeat our very purposes. You're being sentimental. I am being practical ! No, Brack. Use a machine to control a man's brain, you destroy his initiative. You destroy his power to help us as we need help. We can both see it right here. It may be true, but are you sure ? We're 30 miles from nowhere. Steve and I know. We've tried. And if we did get out, who'd believe all this ? I don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for Exeter. It's a rare privilege. He's a rare man. Our little Neutron gave us away. He felt the impulses. That cat. I could -- put Neutron under the thought transformer ? Why not, Brack ? And perhaps you'd like me to step in with him. Turn it off, Brack. Our friends won't be giving us any more information tonight. 236 + 1.008 to the ninth. it's an interesting equation. I'll check it. You may find it'll help you over some of the more difficult obstacles. And now, doctor, I'd like to acquaint you with another of our accomplishments. Notice that section of lead plate behind you ? Please bring it forward about eight feet. Now please move back. By the door, doctor. When your lead-to-uranium process is working properly, the effectiveness of this ray will be increased enormously. Tell me, Exeter, Why should a communication device be equipped with a destructive ray ? Mountains.trates Neutrino rays, we can. Neutrino rays ? You've just observed one in action. I suppose the neutrino could be described. as the missing link between energy and matter. Fascinating. if destruction is our goal. On the contrary. Just recently, one of our rays was used for quite another purpose. More specifically, to save your life. Exactly. The green light ? It safely to Earthying After it first immobilized my controls. Meacham, I must ask you to have faith in our ultimate aims. I must also ask you to refrain from meeting with any of your co-workers again, usual channels. Any way you want it. Very good, doctor. aAd your patience, I promise you, will be rewarded. Here's a sketch of the interocitor. I also have rough notes on its working controls. It's guesswork mostly but better than nothing. And these are portraits of Exeter and Brack. Do you notice. The peculiar indentations in both their foreheads ? Coincidental, no doubt. This is the one we're really proud of, Cal. We discovered this a week ago two miles south of here. Has been hollowed out, the excavationing what's in there. Steve wanted to go back and find out what was inside. I guess I got cold feet. Just like Vermont. Still a sissy. They're fine, Steve. When we get out of here, I'll have them framed at my own expense. If we get out. He's just hungry. Good-bye, Neutron. Confirm, please. Plan "a" abandoned. Alternate plan in effect. Correct. Our ionization layer is failing rapidly. We may need transportation. Are you prepared to leave ? We have been since your last communication, although Meacham and Adams are achieving positive results. - Can you give us another time period ? - Impossible. But it is hoped that you will be able to complete the project here. Bring them. Good. You will keep in contact until moment of departure. Then remove all evidence of installation. That is all. Take over. What is it ? Something i've seen before. Get off the road, quick ! They're playing with us. We're sitting ducks in this thing. If we're gonna make the airport, we'll have to do it on foot. When I stop, we'll pile out. Take cover fast. Steve ! Steve ! We've gotta get out of here. Get down ! Get away ! We'll try and make the airport. Let's go. Is it flyable ? It should be. Exeter keeps it here for the staff. They're pulling us up. Remain here. I want a report on temperature control immediately. Use extreme caution through the thermal barrier. Our two passengers are very sensitive to heat. The passengers are here. Allow me to welcome you. I'm sorry that our visit below had to be terminated so dramatically, but time allowed for nothing else. We mean you no harm. Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg ? Like the others in that house ? What happened was beyond my control. What happened was mass murder. We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham. That's a nice little phrase coming from you. I learned it on Earth. Look. The two of you are beginning a strange journey, a journey that no Earth people have ever undertaken before. Whether you consider me a devil or a saint is unimportant. What is important is that you're here, on this spaceship. Suppose then, for the time being, we call a truce. As scientists at least, Meacham. Ruth, don't tell me that, as a woman, you're not curious about our destination. Where are we going ? To a planet we call Metaluna. Metaluna ? There's no such planet in the solar system. Metaluna lies far beyond your solar system, in outer space. The stellarscope will convince you. Come. Observer, prepare a view of the second quadrant, please. I won't ask you to condone what we've done. All I ask is that when you understand the plight of my people, you try to have more sympathy for our deeds. Earth. it's being left far behind. Cal. it's getting hard to breathe. We're going through the thermal barrier. You'll find the temperature unpleasant for a short time. Prepare to leave Earth's orbit. All conversion must be completed during this time period. Follow me, if you will. Exeter, what are you using for power ? How are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship ? What's to prevent us from floating around like balloons. Once we leave Earth's gravity ? To answer the last question first, we create our own gravitational field. No matter what position our ship takes in space, we here inside remain right side up. But if we're going to get you to Metaluna alive, there's a little procedure you'll have to go through. What are you doing to them ? Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans. If we entered Metaluna's orbit without conversion, we'd be crushed to death. But in going from Metaluna to Earth, the tissues of our bodies would dwindle. We'd disintegrate completely. Correct, Meacham, If we're fortunate enough to return to Earth. Brack ? Yes. You will prepare the doctors for the tubes. You'll change into clothes such as ours, especially conditioned for life on Metaluna. Come with me. Above the rails. They're magnetized. In the tubesystem Long as you're able to. Ruth ? Yes ? You okay ? And you ? Feel like a new toothbrush. Ruth -- Cal -- Enemy-controlled sector. This is master control awaiting instructions. You'll energize only as necessary. Conserve power. Avoid contact with enemy until safety of ship is endangered. You'll feel stronger in a few moments. Now I know you both feel as though you could sleep for at least a thousand years, But then you'd miss observing our approach to Metaluna, And with your curiosity, you'd never forgive me for that. I don't understand. What don't you understand, doctor ? Those two objects. They appear to be comets, but their paths are identical, almost as though some intelligence were controlling them. Your deduction is quite correct, doctor, Although the objects are not comets. They're meteors controlled by spacecraft of Zahgon. They're going to hit us ! We've offered to make peace with Zahgon, but to no avail. Is Zahgon a planet ? A planet that was once a comet. As you can see, their spacecraft are actually guiding the meteors against us. Now in fourth quadrant. Metaluna contact in three time periods. Observer, a closer view. View in third quadrant. Contact in two time periods. View in second quadrant. Contact in one time period. View in first quadrant at ionization wave. What you're observing may well be the beginning of the end. for our world. The Zahgon meteors are beginning to get through our ionized layer. That haze, a feeling of intense radiation. Such a screen requires the output of great amounts of atomic energy. And you're running out. That's why you were sent to Earth. And why you sent for us. You need uranium. In gigantic quantities. Our own deposits are exhausted. As our power diminishes, our protection fails. That's enough. Normal view. Entering ionized layer. Metaluna. Brack, remove the equipment of our two doctors to turbine center. Have it all set up for immediate use. Oh, Brack, I'm sure personnel will need everyone. Have the crew report immediately for reassignment. Now we must report to the Monitor. Step in ! Our means of interior transportation. Before the war forced us to move inside our planet, these tubes covered the surface of our Earth. Our educational complexes, now rubble. Over there was a recreation center. This way. The Monitor's structure. Welcome, Exeter. Observed your flight. Almost counted you lost. Your Earth creatures. Dr. Adams, Dr. Meacham. The Monitor, supreme head of our government. Regrettable there is no time for amenities. I am certain your minds. have difficulty grasping this transition from Earth to Metaluna. I've given them as much indoctrination as possible. Then you know that shortly we can expect Zahgon to commence and sustain an all-out attack. Our ionization layer must be maintained until our relocation. is effected. Relocation ? To where ? To your Earth. A peaceful relocation. We hope to live in harmony. - With the citizens of your Earth. - In harmony ! Our knowledge and weapons would make us your superiors naturally. Then why haven't your superior brains solved the problem of synthesizing uranium ? Most of our scientists are dead, our major laboratories destroyed. The war has reduced our population to a mere handful. That is true, Meacham. It is indeed typical that you Earth people. refuse to believe in the superiority of any world but your own. Children looking into a magnifying glass, imagining the image you see is the image of your true size. Our true size is the size of our God. Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these Earth creatures to have free minds ? I do. I know them. I've lived with them. You have wasted our time. Take them to the thought transference chamber. Please come with me. I'm afraid you have no choice. Interocitor control, hear me. Ionization failing at prime sector. Use emergency power and repel attack. Power transfer will begin immediately. Our Zahgon friends seem to be hitting this prime sector quite regularly. Is that where it is ? In there ? My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it. I'm not going into that room ! Nobody is. Come on ! I'm sorry. I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand. This is a mutant. For ages to do menial work. They're similar to insect life on your own planet. Larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence. This one has been given orders to guard this corridor as long as we're here. I beg of you, go inside. Cooperate voluntarily. I give you my word you will not be harmed or your minds changed in any way. You'd defy the Monitor ? I already have ! Do you believe him, Cal ? In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother. Come on ! The travel car ! Come on ! Where are we going ? The spaceship. It's safer there. Don't you understand ? Let it happen now. Meacham ! Ruth ! Stand back, Exeter. Meacham, believe me, I want to help you. Time is short. Get into the car ! He appears badly hurt. Stay close to me. Stand back. I command you: stand back ! Cal ! Are you badly hurt ? I'll be all right. Close off all hatches. Control room, quick ! I'm all right. Ruth, activate the stellarscope. Right control, 45 degrees left. Our ionization layer has failed completely. Will we be able to get out ? Depends on the amount of energy we have left. If we have to ward off any heavy Zahgon attacks, I don't know. That may be the last of them. Yes, they're concentrating all their attention on Metaluna. Those flashes of light, they're meteors. Hundreds of them. The intense heat is turning Metaluna into a radioactive sun. The temperature must be thousands of degrees by now. A lifeless planet. And yet -- yet still serving a useful purpose, I hope. Yes, a Sun, warming the surface of some other world, giving light to those who may need it. Now, into the converter tubes. Ruth, you take the first tube. You, the next. What about you ? I'll use the third tube. Exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out ? Possibly. He's bleeding badly. In a very few moments, the pressure should destroy him. Run, Ruth, run ! Our speed is diminishing. We're now in the atmosphere of Earth. Your plane is where you left it: in the cargo hold. A conventional way for you to return to Earth, I admit, But perhaps the most practical. Where are you going ? Our universe is vast, full of wonders. I'll explore, perhaps find another Metaluna, a place inhabited by beings not unlike myself. You see, I'm more adventurous than you imagined me. Exeter, you're a liar. You've used all your power bringing us here. Even if you had a place to go, you couldn't make it. Come with us. We'll heal your wounds. I'm afraid my wounds can never be healed. You've things to teach us. Thank you. We're over your Earth now. It's time for you to go. Farewell. Home. Thank God it's still here. - Move! - Let's go, let's go! We did it, right? Whoa! What the hell are you doing? - G-Girl! - It's G-Girl! Gun! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! Wow. If you could have any superpower, what would it be? The ability to blow myself. That's quite a visual. - But wouldn't it seem a little. - Gay? - No, not at all. Think about it. - Yeah, really? It seems that way. Oh, dude. Check her out. Ooh. Wow. What do we have here? Kind of uptight librarian on the outside, ready to rumble on the inside. - Go ask her out. - No. I'm not ready yet. I can't. Oh, Matt. You're killing me. Your last insane girlfriend dumped you, like, six months ago. I would have ploughed my way through half of SoHo by now. That's cos you're soulless and shallow. It is a blessing. Go over there. Talk to her. Do it. - Matt, say hi. Give me your bag. Come on. - OK, OK. Yes. All out. Be strong. Breathe. Eye of the tiger. Hi. Excuse me. I know I don't really know you, but you look like a very interesting person, so at the risk of totally humiliating myself, I thought perhaps sometime I might buy you a cup. No! It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It could be whatever you want. A cup of anything. Juice? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Somebody stop that guy! That's right. You better run, asshole! Keep running, my man! You don't want any of this. Keep running. Yeah! - What did you call me? - Oh, shit! What did you call me? Idiot. Come on! Get out of there. Let's go! I know you're in there. Get out of there! Whoa! Hey. How about it, huh? So how about that cup of coffee? Or it could be something more substantial. - Like dinner? - Yeah. That'd be great. - Matt Saunders. - Jenny Johnson. Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name. You got the whole alliteration thing going. I grew up with a guy named Francis Freddie Friedman. A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd want over if you had spare cash laying out. Yeah, right. Right. So, um. May I get your number? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't give it out. Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though. - OK. Actually, I don't think I have a pen. - I do. Thanks. Isn't this something women do just to blow off losers? Yes, women do do that. But that's not how I blow off losers. Hey, Saunders, heads up. - Oh, you have bad reflexes. - You know, you're a danger in the workplace. Do you have the bathroom layouts for the Beijing presentation? - I'll take a look at those. - I finished them up last night. - Hey, Hannah. - Hey, Vaughn. - Looks good. - Thank you. What about. Is this OK? It's a bit tight, but I talked to the structural engineer. - How's your boyfriend? Isn't his name Rick? - Steve. He's good. He just got back from Milan. Look at this. - Milan? - Yes, his new Joe Boxer ad campaign. Wow. He's buff. Are you into that? I would think this is more your style. What do you think? Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and the right steroids, I look like that or better. - Here you go. - Thank you. - What are you doing?! - Huh? Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving some reference material, trying to stay ahead. - You were staring at her butt. - He was? - No. No, I was not. - Yes, he was. Hannah, as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for this behavior. I actually read that memo twice. I got it. You should be familiar with this part. Would you like to file a grievance at this time? Um. I don't think so, Carla. Because, as your supervisor, I am officially giving you that opportunity right now. And I thank you for that, but I think I'm just gonna let this one slide. That's completely your decision. - Will you sign a statement to that effect? - Sure. Yes. You are lucky this time, Mr. Bottom Watcher. - Hello? - Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson. - Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear from you. - So are we still on for dinner? - Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great. - Is that a girl? A real, live girl? A great new Indian place on Madison just opened up. Eight o'clock? Indian? Love it. I'll see you tomorrow night. OK. Great. See you. Bye. Saunders! Do you have a date? Got a date. And it's a hot one. So the assistant curator job's really perfect for me. I was an art history major in college. It's the only thing I'm good at. At least, the only thing I'm good at I can make any money off. - That sounded like I was talking about sex. - No. No, it didn't. Believe me, I didn't mean sex. - I mean, I am good at sex. - I'm sure you are. - Now it sounds like I'm bragging. - No, no. I think I'm good at sex. I don't know, you decide. Me? But not tonight. It's our first date. Yeah. So what do you do? I'm a project manager at a design firm. We design and build private estates, libraries, hotels, that sort of thing. Yeah, right now, we're. - I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? - What? No. No. Um. I was just trying to listen to something. I don't hear anything. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I have to go to the bathroom. Sure. - Yo, how's it going? - Well, she's a talker, yeah. - Only question is, will you sleep with her? - <i>That's the only question, huh?</i> Yes. I'm not just talking about your date tonight. I am talking about life in general. - That is the only question. - What's going on there? Uh, some big fire at 73rd and Broadway. Everything's burning. - <i>Is anyone hurt?</i> - I don't know. Probably. It's blocking my way to the gym. My thoughts are with you in this time of crisis. Wow! Oh, man! - <i>What's going on?</i> - It's G-Girl! She's doing her thing. Are you serious? You lucky SOB. I've never even seen her in person. How does she look? She looks. - <i>What?</i> - Blurry. But still pretty hot. <i>Yeah? What's she doing now?</i> She's spinning around like one of those things that spins. <i>Amazing. That's unbelievable.</i> Yeah. It's so cool. Oh! Yes. That's it, show's over. She put the fire out. Fantastic. G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! Oh! OK. And she's gone. Flew off into the sunset. Amazing. <i>Unbelievable. Hey, why do you think</i> <i>they call her G-Girl?</i> I don't know, like, "gorgeous" or "G-force"? I'm not really sure. <i>What do you think about "good kisser"?</i> I can't believe I missed that. I'm eating Indian food. <i>Oh, wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".</i> - <i>What about "G-spot"?</i> - I gotta go. Bye. Whoo! Huge line. Sorry. It was a really, really long line. - You got a little something on your chin. - What? Oh. Oh. - I hate when that happens. - When what happens? Mystery smudges. - Gotta go to the bathroom. - Um. You didn't just go to the bathroom? Are you keeping track? That's kind of creepy. - She sounds like a nutcase. - So you're saying she's perfect for me? Crazy women are attracted to you. It's like you give off a scent. You should do a background check on her. What do you think? Shall we keep these walls brick or make it stucco? - Did you kick the plug? - I don't know. - Let me handle this one. - All right. - Don't do that. - Don't do what? What are you talking about? You mean this? Hey! Sexual harassment's a two-way street. Don't think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me. Hey! What the hell's going on here? - Oh, no. Sorry, her. - Steve. Her computer had gone down. I was plugging it back in. - I'm screwing with you. I'm not worried. - Oh. None taken. - I missed you. - I missed you too. - Not here! - Sorry. See, Saunders? You need to be with someone who appreciates you, like Steve here. Yeah. I'm looking for Mr. Right. Haven't found him yet, though. Not given up. - Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you. - This is Matt. You've met him, like, five times. - Oh, right, right. Sorry. - It's OK. I'm a very forgettable person. When I was growing up, I'd come down to breakfast and Mom would scream, call the cops on me. - It's a joke, right? Yeah. - Yeah. - It's a good one. Got me back. - Hey, baby, we should be going to lunch. Hey, Saunders, that woman is trouble. Do not call her. - OK, we're done. - What happened? We just started. That's it. No. I got a twinge. Dude, you should definitely call her back. - Yeah? You think I should? - Oh, yeah. Cos she's good to go. And you haven't gone in six months. Oh, yes. Plus, what's the downside? I don't know. She seems a little, uh. She's neurotic, you know. And distant. That's good. That's a good thing. Neurotic and distant is a very good thing. Yeah, neurotic women are hellcats in bed. Plus, if she's distant, you're both in it for the same thing. Coitus maximus. There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way. It's just pure carnal nirvana. - Your argument's repugnant and intriguing. - That's kind of my thing. - Oh, hey. - Hi. Oh, wow. Thank you. - You're welcome. - A rose. Different color roses mean different things. Red ones mean passion or love, so this is great. But I'm not saying I think you're telling me that you love me. I mean, it's absurdly early for that. But you never know. Maybe someday. Or never. No pressure. Let me get us a cab. Taxi. Taxi! Hey, it's stopping. Here we go. You OK? At least we got a ride. Can we stop by the gallery? We opened a new show. Sounds great. Hey, thanks for stopping. Appreciate it. Wow. Wonder what she's looking at. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. So what do you think? It's interesting. And a little disturbing. I know. It's surprising how frightening things attract us. Matt, I have to help people every day, and nobody's ever helped me except you. You're my hero. I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me. It's your tongue. You're using it all wrong. - What are you talking about? - You shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish. You're supposed to flick it a little. I think that I was flicking it, wasn't I? I was doing that. - No. Not enough. - Really? I'm not used to having my tongue skills critiqued like this, OK? Maybe not to your face. Oh, man. Let me help you. Close your eyes. Now do what I do. So, uh. this is my place. I redesigned the space when I bought it. - It's nice. - Thank you. This is the dining room. Doesn't get a lot of use. - Well, I could help with that. - OK. This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls. Hi, Biggie. He's. he's never met a woman before. Well, he's about to get an eyeful. - <i>Will you show me the rest of your place?</i> - <i>OK.</i> <i>I'll take you over to the kitchen.</i> <i>That's the refrigerator.</i> <i>I can get you a juice, a beer.</i> <i>I'll make you anything. Yeah.</i> I'm not thirsty either. - And this is the, uh. - Bed. Oh, that's a great sweater. Wow. What a blouse. Let me help with those buttons. - I'm sorry. I need the, um. - Oh, yeah. The bathroom? It's right there. She goes to the bathroom a lot. I'm ready. That's what I call structural integrity. All right! You should have been dressed like that all night. You look great. Let me help you with this. Ooh. - I must be a little nervous. - It's OK. I got a closet full of 'em. Let me handle this one, though. - Let's take care of these. - OK. Thanks. Who'd have thought we'd have ended up like this after that day on the subway? Ain't life grand? - Matt? - Yeah? Do you mind if I get on top? Trust me, it's better that way. 10-4. Are you ready? - OK. - OK. Here we go. Wow. OK, I get it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoo! Whoo! Oh, goddamn! OK, now I need a break. Agh! I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one. - A bed or a penis? - Both. There are three moments I will remember until the day I die. One, the look on my father's face when I graduated from Harvard Law School. Two, helping a beached mother whale give birth. And three, you and me together, here, tonight. Don't speak to me again, ever. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Water, please. Got a big night. No, no, no. Don't tell me. You have invaded the female nation and spread your democracy. What can I say? She's completely different than I thought she was. - Hot, though, right? - Unbelievably hot. I don't even know if I should tell you this. I don't know if you can handle it. I can handle it. Please? - She broke my bed. - Wow. Busted it to pieces. - And that's a good thing, right? - Yeah. That's a good thing. - I'm gonna see her again today. - What are you talking about? No! You have sex with her once and then you move on. Not if you get on the greatest ever roller coaster, you don't. You get back in that line. Get in line, ride two or three more times, throw your hands in the air and scream. But soon you're gonna end up nauseous. Hey, guys. - How are you guys doing? - Keep that safety bar clamped down. OK, I think you are gonna like this. I have a little present for you, Saunders. - Anything for me there? - No. No, Vaughn. - You have nice ears. - Thank you. - No lobes, though. - An imperfection. We all got 'em. Not me. Hey, so I downloaded some Chinese phrases for you, for the presentation. - What do you think? Thought it might help. - That's great. - I thought it would help. - You're the best, you know that? I know. I am. Well, I gotta get going. I'm going to see Jenny. - You're seeing Jenny? Again? - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh. Things must really be going well. - She broke his bed. Thanks. That was really thoughtful of you. - Oh, no problem. - I'll see you two later. - See you, Matt. - Look after her, OK? I will. - Man, he's seeing Jenny again? - Just a few more times. - Matt Saunders? We're gonna take a ride. - Wait a second! Hey! Wait! Hey, now, look. I don't appreciate being manhandled. What's going on? - Mr. Saunders, thank you for your time. - OK. Now, who are you? Who am I? Do you watch television, Mr. Saunders? Read the papers? - Use the net for anything other than porn? - You're that Bedlam guy. - Professor Bedlam. - The "supervillain". Please, I am not super, I am not a villain. I'm just a regular man, like yourself, with 10,000 times more money, intelligence and taste. OK, so what do you want from me? Are you seeing anyone, Mr. Saunders? Are you asking me out? Ow! I want you to tell me everything you know about your new girlfriend. - Jenny? - Yes. Jenny. Where does she like to go? What does she like to do? What music does she listen to? Is she afraid of bugs? Is she a dog person or a cat person? - Does she wear panties. - OK, now, look. Hold on just a goddamn. Now, look. It's gotta stop with the slapping, all right?! I just don't feel real comfortable telling you, a total stranger, someone's private habits. You gotta understand that, right? Of course. Please, someone! Help! Help! Save me! Please! Weasel! Hey! Help! Yeah, you! You! Get somebody from the Park Service! Oh, jeez! No! Help me! Oh, no! Oh, my God! - G-Girl! G-Girl, you saved me. Thank you! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Whoa! Hold me! Hold me! - Don't look at me! - But I just wanted to. - Don't look at me! OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger. Wow. Looks like little Jenny's been cashing in on her superpowers. Idiot! We don't want her to know we dropped by. Ah. Perfect. So I'm falling, I mean, hurdling through the sky. And just as I'm about to bite it, and I mean out of nowhere, she just catches me and sets me right on the ground. It was unbelievable. The weird thing is, though, that Bedlam guy, he kept asking me about you. - Do you know him? - No, how could I know him? - That's what I was thinking. - So what was she like? G-Girl? I didn't really get a good look at her, but to tell you the truth, - she wasn't really what I expected, you know. - In what way? - I don't know. She just seemed a little. - Brainy? - Not really. - Exotic? Effervescent? No, I kind of got this vibe she was a little nuts. Nuts?! Maybe she was a little bit preoccupied, having searched the entire city to save you from being squished like a bug on a windshield! You girls all really stick together, don't you? I like it. You're like one big gang. - Rule number one about crossing the street? - Look both ways. That's right. Jenny! - One of you call 911! - I'm fine. I'm fine. That was close. I'm fine, I'm fine. - You're not fine. How can you be fine? - Look, Matt, I can walk. Don't move. You probably have internal bleeding and don't know it. - No, not even a scratch. - You are in shock. Did anyone see this? It's like a miracle. Truly, it's like a miracle. I mean, are you sure that you're OK? I mean, you seem to be walking fine. Yeah. This is the first time that I've ever brought anybody here. - Ever. - Really? Wow. Yeah, it seems like a really great place. I'm still just kind of wondering what the hell happened out there. I know. I didn't expect to do this. At least, not yet anyway. - But it's good. It's good. - OK. Cos what we have is so very, very special. - I trust you. - OK. There should be nothing hanging between us. Especially not this, don't you think? I don't know what you're talking about. I'll have to show you. You look nice without your glasses. You look good with them too. I'll hold them for you. OK. I don't know what the explanation is, but I like it already. Unless it's one of those <i>Crying Game</i> things? It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver. Just wait. You got a G-Girl costume on. That's. Kind of went all out, didn't you? And you even dyed your. Oh. Wow! Are you kidding me? Oh, man. This is incredible. - But you can't tell anyone! - Yeah, nobody except Vaughn. He slept with a Victoria's Secret model, I've never heard the end of it. - This will blow that out of the water. - No! Nobody. Matt, you have to promise me you'll never, ever tell anyone. - Fine, you got it. - No matter what, you will <i>never</i> tell anyone. Hey, I swear. Say you'd rather have a chain saw shoved up your ass than tell. - Is that actually a possibility? - Say it! I'd rather have a chain saw shoved up my ass than tell. OK. So this Bedlam guy, he's like your arch nemesis or something? Uh-huh. He's been a pain in the butt ever since we had this falling out in high school. - You guys went to school together? - Mm-hm. Wow. By the way, his name's not really Bedlam. It's Barry. Barry Edward Lambert. Bedlam, get it? <i>Back then, we were both kind of outcasts.</i> <i>Everybody else hated us.</i> Nerd alert! Here come the geeks. <i>So we looked out for each other.</i> <i>It's only natural</i> <i>that we spent a lot of time together.</i> <i>We really liked each other.</i> <i>It was close to the end of our junior year</i> <i>when I decided it was about time</i> <i>to get the virginity thing over with.</i> <i>I mean, Barry was harmless enough.</i> <i>I figured it might as well be him, right?</i> <i>He was having some trouble</i> <i>getting his pants off.</i> <i>And that's when it happened.</i> Jenny! Come on! This is not how I planned this evening. Oh, my God. Look at that. It's so cool. - What are you doing? - Isn't it amazing? Don't. It could be dangerous. <i>When I got back to school,</i> <i>even with a wig,</i> <i>people noticed</i> <i>there was something different about me.</i> Hi, girls. Ooh, my glasses. <i>And it worked for me.</i> Hey. Ugh! <i>Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.</i> <i>He stopped talking to me.</i> <i>And then ignored me totally.</i> Anyway, things got worse between us after I graduated. I committed to being a full-time superhero and he fell into the evil mastermind business, yada-yada-yada. That's my story. Wow. And this whole time, I just had this weird feeling that there was just something a little off about you. - Really? - You just had a secret, that's all. - A supersecret. - Now we both do. - May I ask you something? - What? I just think it could maybe be a fun thing to try. It's kind of a request. Sure. - Be right back. - OK. Is this what you had in mind? Oh, yeah. That's it. Matt Saunders, you've been a very, very evil boy. I think you need to be brought to justice. Yeah. I have been known to bend a rule here and there. Total unrelenting justice. Hey! Wow! Shit! - Don't let go, all right? - Oh, no. Oh, yeah, you got me. Scared you. Wow. Wow, we are high. - We are really, really high. - Oh, yeah! Jenny, you know, as fun as this is, I'm feeling just a little bit emasculated here, with you kind of carrying me around like a toy poodle. But don't let go. Careful. Where are you going? Careful. Come on. Fly right. Be careful. - I've always wanted to try this. - Try what? That? Wow. I'm not sure that's gonna work up here. It's draughty too. What if I do this? - You're not wearing any underwear. - Yeah. I thought it might be easier that way. - Isn't this fun? - It is fun. Yeah. Puts a whole new twist on the mile-high club. Ready? Whoa. Not ready! - No! - Just go with it. - Yeah, but. - I know, I know! Don't stop! Yes. - No! - Yes! - Oh, god, no! - Yeah! Jenny! Yes! Yes! Don't ever do that again! G-Girl's hair before. Watch and learn. Her body is made of the toughest substance known to man. But I know your secret. All right, now. G-Girl's hair after. Yes! Yes! - Saunders, what's wrong? - I got a splinter in my finger. - Let me see. - It's no big deal. I can get it out, I just need. - Come here. I'm good at this. - What are you gonna do? Hold on. Hey, how did you do that? Well, I have my ways. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Jenny, what. What are you doing in New Jersey? I called your office and found out where you were. I thought I would surprise you. - Are you surprised? - I am surprised. I wanted to. Thanks. Good to see you. Let me introduce you to Hannah Lewis. - This is Jenny Johnson. - Hi. It's really nice to finally meet you. - Saunders talks about you all the time. - I do. - I feel like I already know you. - Really? Cos I feel like I'm just getting to know you. OK. Hey, um. Got an idea. Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was thinking, maybe we go out this weekend, just the two couples, two happy couples, hit the town? What do you say? - Great. - Great. Great. Oh, OK. Bye. I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news. - You got a little something right there. - Oh, thank you. Steve can't make it. He had an emergency thong shoot. - A thong shoot emergency? - Yeah, well, you know, one bad wedgie can be fatal. Yeah. Where's our stupid waiter? Sir! Hold on. Something's going on. <i>The Pentagon has confirmed</i> <i>an errant test missile</i> <i>is in fact on a direct course</i> <i>for the tristate area.</i> <i>So far, all attempts to detonate or intercept</i> <i>the missile have been unsuccessful.</i> Great. Perfect. <i>If it strikes within the city,</i> <i>the death toll could reach into the thousands.</i> - That does not sound good. - Yeah, it sounds serious. Maybe somebody should do something. Mm-hm, yeah, like the air force. It's their job, right? So, Hannah, how long have you and Matty known each other? Well, we started working together at Cockrum about three years ago. <i>We're getting reports of sporadic</i> <i>looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.</i> <i>The government has urged people</i> <i>not to panic and to stay in their homes.</i> Mmm, gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good. Anyone want to share a gnocchi? I'm sorry, but what if the air force can't stop it? Somebody else might need to step in. Maybe somebody deserves one night out without having to deal with some impending disaster. I think someone has earned it. Don't you? Are you on a diet? What are you gonna order? I don't know. I mean, shouldn't we be leaving? Is this safe here? Sir! Can we get some service here? I mean, I'm filling up on baguette. I think everybody's preoccupied with what's happening. Maybe if someone could just take care of the problem, everyone can have a better night, a smoother night, know what I mean? - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Yeah, I'd appreciate it. In fact, I'd superappreciate it. All right. Fine! Is she OK? Where is she going? She's fine. She gets stressed. I have her looping around the block. <i>Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation</i> <i>is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.</i> <i>But all the citizens of New York can do</i> <i>is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.</i> <i>We're now getting a live picture of the missile</i> <i>as it approaches the city.</i> <i>It appears certain that. Wait, what is that?</i> <i>It is G-Girl!</i> - <i>She is approaching the errant missile.</i> - Love that girl! <i>My God!</i> <i>She just kicked it.</i> <i>She just deflected the missile</i> <i>away from the city.</i> <i>We're safe! We are safe!</i> G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! You know, Matt, there are some things I don't need infravision to see through. Sorry, what are you talking about? You and that slut from your office - Hannah. She is not a slut. That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny. - You want to screw her, don't you? - No. No, I do not. I don't believe you. Can I say something? Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model. I don't think she'd be very interested in a guy like me. I see your point. So you want to screw her, you just can't, because she's got a boyfriend. No, I'm just saying that we're friends who work together. We're work friends. Don't lie to me! - What the hell did you do that for? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll pay for that, I swear. OK, don't. d-don't do that. Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK. I know I get a little crazy sometimes. It's just. I love you so much. OK. OK. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? Oh, sorry. Look at her. She's like a cheerleader from Spank Me University. Dude, what's wrong? You look like shit. Let's go with the lighter weight today, shall we? I'm actually thinking that my first impression of Jenny was accurate. - Oh, no. - Yeah, complete emotional basket case. - Needy, jealous. - Mm-hm. Jealous. .control. - Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect. The truth is, I don't even love her. I'm in love with somebody else. You're in love with somebody else? Who? Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it? I feel the same way. I totally. That's not a good sign, is it? - Who are you talking about? - I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her. But, I mean, first I have to break it off with Jenny. - God knows how I'm gonna do that. - OK, come with me. Listen. There are only two ways to successfully break it off with a woman. You can either be a jerk or a weenie. Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like, "Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass." Just like that. It's quick, it's easy, it's painless. - I don't think you have the balls for it. - Well, what's the weenie route? OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that. Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK? Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye, take her hand. Give me your hand. You say, "Sweetheart, I think we need to take a little time off from the relationship to re-evaluate things." Don't return any of her calls for a year and a half. Pretty soon she'll give up and you'll be in the clear. I can't believe I actually listen to you. Another thing. Make sure you do it after you've had sex with her. It's really difficult the other way around. I was thinking, maybe we should take a little time to. re-examine where this is going. My God. Are you breaking up with me? No. No. Not at all. I mean, I just. I think it would be wise to try and evaluate where we stand, just to make sure we're on the same page. So you're not saying that we should start seeing other people or anything? No. No. No, I'm not saying that. OK, good. You scared me there for a second. Although seeing other people might eventually be a part of the evaluation process. Oh, my God. You are breaking up with me. - Jenny, it's not you, OK? - Shut up! I know exactly what it is. It's that slut from your office, Hannah. - You're sleeping with her. - I am not sleep. - But you want to! - Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK? You're such a liar! Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you. You're needy, jealous, manipulative. I can't take it anymore. - It's crazy. - Don't call me crazy! See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. I can't handle that on a daily basis. Well, handle this. What are you doing?! You are so gonna regret this. Oh, man. - Wednesday? Thursday? - No. No. Friday? Saturday? Sunday? Brunch? In the day? Don't speak to me. Oh, well. Look at it this way. The hard part is over. I don't know. She said I'd regret it. Don't worry about that. They always say that. Yeah? I guess you're right. You know, there's something that I've been dying to tell you ever since I found it out. - Found out what? - I just need you to promise me. - I promise. - Hold on, let me finish, this is serious. - I need you to promise me that you're not. - I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me. You know Jenny? Yeah. She's G-Girl. Bullshit. Bullshit. Apparently, this old dog still has a few tricks left. Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl! - I know! It's unbelievable. Me. - Incredible. - I can't believe it. - Knuckles. Imagine the heat I'll have with the women when they find out. Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind you revealing her secret identity? I warned you, Matt Saunders! No! Watch it, dumb-ass! - What's wrong? - Nothing. What could be wrong? Everything's great. Never better. Tell me. OK. I, uh. I broke up with Jenny. You were right. I mean, she is totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy. I should have listened to you from the beginning. Why don't you lay off the crazy women for a while, huh? Come here. I'm sorry. Hey, Hannah. There's been something that I've been meaning to tell you for a long time. Yes? It's about you and. - Sorry. Are you OK? - Out. Now. I'm going through a weird phase. - I saw that! - What? No, it was nothing, Carla. Nothing? You knocked her down! You hit her! - Was there groping? Did he grope you? - No, it was an accident. An accident? OK, like a fender-bender? Here, we need to talk. Come here. Listen, my friend. You are headed for some serious trouble. - Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake. - OK. You have got to get your mind out of the gutter long enough to nail this presentation. - I hear you, homegirl. I got it. - What? What did you just call me?! What? I don't know. If the company doesn't get this project, we're going to take a major hit. You really have a problem. Call my therapist. OK, I'll call him. her. - Matt. - What? - Phone call. - Oh, man. That boy has a major case of the hornies. Yeah? There's the young kid that zooms around in here. Did he do something? - It's just up here. - Looks like they broke in, fried the camera and then blew a huge hole through the wall. - I've never seen nothing like it. - Don't make no sense. We got a lot of nice cars - his is the only one they took. Bitch. Somebody went to a lot of trouble. You know who could have done this? No. No, I don't. - Somebody with a grudge against you? - Grudge? Against me? No. No, I don't. I'm sorry. - We'll let you know if it turns up. - OK. - Let's get to the paperwork. - I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir. Gentlemen. If you look closely, our model here. What the hell.? Oh, that's just great. Oh, shit! I just got that fixed. Sorry, just came to use your telescope. Nice and dark, isn't it? Wait a second. Is this all because of you? Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes. There we go. Come and have a look-see. I don't see any. - That's real mature. - Save you a fortune in parking. Why are you doing this to me? I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy. I am the good guy. You are the bad guy. It's been a pleasure seeing you, but I got a big day at the office tomorrow. I've got an important presentation to make, so I need to get some sleep. I'm gonna have to say good night. You might be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with, but you wanna know something? You're the craziest, hands down! - Really? - Aargh! Dick?! Will we begin soon? I'm so sorry you've been kept waiting. I apologize. It's very rude. Just a few more minutes, please. - Hi. Excuse me, hi. - Glad you could join us. Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat? - No. - Why am I not surprised? - Hi. How are you? - We can finally begin. - Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders. - You OK? I'm fine. I'm fine. OK, gentlemen. OK. Our design integrates classic architectural ideas from the history of Chinese culture and transforms them into a contemporary 21st century esthetic. But you can see clearly that functionality has not been sac. Sac. Sacrificed, as you can see here by the multiple entrances to the central multipurpose courtyard area. Exactly. Exactly. Right. And with a total capacity for. You are one sick bastard! Oh, man. I am so, so sorry. Thanks. - You gotta laugh to keep from crying, right? - Vaughn, shh! Sorry. Man, no woman's ever done that to me, and I actually <i>am</i> a dick. OK, all done. I am so sorry that you got fired. What happened in there? Why did you. It's hard to explain. Let's just say it's a good time for me to leave. - Where are you going? - Don't know. Don't care. Look, if there's something wrong, I'd like to help. Look, Hannah. Please just stay as far away from me as possible, OK? If something were to happen to you because of me, I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Oh, damn! May we come in? Nice place. You broke her heart, didn't you? What do you need? Why are you here? I'm in the middle of a project. The same as you - to get her out of my life for good. I want you to help me neutralize her. Hey, whatever she's done to me, I'm not gonna help you kill her. I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralize". It's a neutral word. "Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland. I have developed the means of permanently stripping her of her powers. No powers? So she'd just be another average, everyday, run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend? Yeah. That's gotta be better. - So what would you want me to do? - Draw her out into the open. Help me get her when her guard is down, when she's vulnerable. Look, I don't mean to offend you, but you have a reputation for doing things that most people would consider to be. No-nos? Yes. Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring. - From supervillainy? - Yeah. That's good. Look, if you're going to retire, why not just forget about her? That's what I'm gonna do. I'm leaving town. Because that woman, she just won't leave me alone. She's obsessed with me. She has harassed me at every turn and she never, ever stops. So when you finally realize that she is not the woman who is ever going to forget about you, - then you give me a call. - OK. All right? Or you can email me at "professorbedlam.com". It's all one word. I think I'll just, uh. give running away a try. <i>It's Matt.</i> <i>Please leave a message.</i> <i>Matt, it's Hannah.</i> <i>Are you there? Please pick up.</i> <i>I. I need your help.</i> <i>Something really bad's happened.</i> - <i>Oh, God, I guess you're not there. Bye.</i> - Hannah! Who is it? It's me, Matt. Open up. Hannah. Are you OK? What did she do to you? Is she here? - Is who here? - G-Girl! G-Girl? Like the superhero? Yeah, G-Girl the super. Why did you call me? - Steve was cheating on me. - Oh, thank God. What? Thank God that you found out sooner rather than later. I am sorry. Yeah, I caught him in bed with another woman. Actually, two other women. Maybe three. I don't know - I didn't really get a good look. - Three? - Yeah. Wow. Steve was so good-looking and he loved jazz and rock-climbing. He took me to nice places and gave me multiple. I don't really need to hear that. The thing is, I never really had any fun with him. Not like I have with you. You've been a really good friend to me, Saunders. Hannah, the thing is, I don't wanna be just a friend any more. - You don't? - No. Look. Hannah, my life has been really crazy lately. But it has made me realize what's most important to me. Seeing you at work every day, that was always the thing I looked forward to the most. You're the smartest, most beautiful girl that I've ever met. And I'm completely and totally in love with you. Oh. Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but this might be the best moment of my life. That's not fair. I was gonna say that. Oh. Hey! Sweetie! Matt? I hate you, Matt Saunders! Get down! Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us? I can't tell you. And she was so pissed off. Have you done something? - Are you in trouble? - No. Well, yeah. And as long as I'm here, so are you. You gotta get outside the city. Go someplace and hide. San Diego. Tahiti. Utah. No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else. But you gotta go someplace, lay low for a while. - I don't understand. - Look. If I ever see you again, this will all be over, OK? If? Matt, wait. - Oh, it's you. - Come in. Wait here. - Right here? Where? - What? Right here. - OK. - Over there. Wow. Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK? I just need to know how we're gonna stop her. I have spent the past ten years trying to analyze the source of G-Girl's power. It is a unique type of radiation that permeates every cell of her body. Yeah, I know about the meteor in high school. She told me. I know. - She told you that? - Yeah. Did she talk about me? I mean, she said you guys were friends, you had a falling out. Bullshit! That meteorite changed everything between us. But now, I've got something that will totally level the playing field. That? The rock? No, the ham. Yes, the rock. A special rock. It was a rock that gave off the radiation. I now have a rock that will absorb the radiation. So if you got Jenny close enough to this thing. It'll draw the radiation from her body, sucking it out of her like a sponge. Draining her of her powers permanently. OK, so what do you need me for? Why can't you just get her close to it? With that superhearing of hers? No, I need someone who can lure her to it. Someone who she has no cause to fear. A weak and powerless simpleton. An idiot. No, all of these invoices were returned. None of them have been paid. Call back. And these two are supposed to be. Hi. Hi. What's this? It's just a little something I thought I'd bring by. - Flowers? - Yeah. You think flowers are going to make me forgive you? No. No, I do not think that. I don't think that at all. Then what the hell are you doing here? OK, look. To be honest, I realize that I've made the biggest mistake of my life. I'm desperately in love with you and I'd do anything for us to be together again. I would. Oh, God. They're beautiful. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What do you think about today after work you come by my place around seven - and I'll make us a nice dinner? - Seven? I'd love to. Matt? Matt? - Oh, my God! - Hey, Jenny. Matt, it's beautiful. Oh, what is that? Is that for me? It is. It's a little something I got you cos. I wanna apologize for the terrible way that I've treated you. - It just wasn't right. - You're so sweet. You didn't have to. - It's true, I'm sorry. - What is it? No peeking, OK? I want it to be a surprise. Let's have a toast. You are amazing. <i>To second chances.</i> <i>To second chances.</i> The man's not bad. He might have a future in our business. You know, deep down, I had a feeling that you'd realize your mistake and come back to me. You are wise. - Do you wanna know a secret? - Sure. That's why I didn't kill you. Matt? You are the sweetest guy I've ever met. - Oh, no, no, I'm not. - Yes, yes, you are. You're sweet. Yummy. Matt?! What are you doing here? Me?! What are you doing here? <i>You said your life was in danger.</i> <i>And what's she doing here?</i> - Who's that? Do we know her? - I don't know her. I don't know her. You know how you tried to steal my boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore? - It didn't work. - Jenny, stop. Let me handle this. - Are you back with her? - No. - What? - Yeah. Look, it's very complicated, OK? How could you do this? You told me you loved me. Hannah, please, just do me a favor, OK? Just leave. I mean, just try to have a little self-respect. You're starting to look pathetic. Matt! You are not. Oh, my God. There you are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day. Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me. - Not now. - Tonight. Third base line. Yahoo! - Now is a terrible time, OK? - Hey, what's in the box? - Stay away from that box. - You know, Hannah, why don't you just run along before I have to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land? - Stay away from it. - It looks big, it might be a nice present. - Are you threatening me? - Push me one more time and you'll find out. Oh, yeah? What are you going to do? Squash me with your gigantic feet? - That's it! - Don't touch me! Just do me a favor and leave and take Hannah with you. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! You're G-Girl. You have been doing G-Girl? - Vaughn, open the box! - Go! Go! Go! Watch the van! Open the damn box! Aargh! - It's not much of a present. - Agh! I'm sorry. You bastard! Matt, that's a weird rock. Ah. A happy ending for everybody. Well done, Mr. Saunders. You did this? You helped him? I'm really sorry. You did throw a shark at me, you know. Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire. It'll be OK. You idiot! Looks like you're done, honey. You always thought you were so much better than me. Now it's my turn. Now I'll be the one with the powers. You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson. We're having a moment here. - Not so tough now, huh?! - Hannah, don't let her touch the rock! Hannah! Oh, no! Hannah! I can't even see her. We gotta get down there. Oh, man! I think she's dead, Matt. - I'm sorry. Let her go. - We gotta dig her out! - We gotta start the grieving process. - Are you crazy? - Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub. - You! I thought you were just a jerk! Now I find out you're really stupid. Teaming up with Barry?! You broke my heart and now I'm gonna break your everything. Hey! Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch! Bring it! Oh, man! Yes, girl fight! Stupid! Matt! No! Hannah! Hannah, are you OK? Oh, no! You rat! Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK? Uh-oh. Wow! Hannah, stop. Come on, stop. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee, but I'm all right. Come on. Forget about them. Let's go. Come on. They're gonna kill each other. This way. - Hey, it's you. - Are you with them? As a matter of fact, I am. They went down there. Stop! Look at yourself. You're terrifying these people. Jenny. Jenny, this has gotta stop right now, OK? Please. Just give me that, OK? There you go. Just give it to me. Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought. Hi. Look, God knows I don't want you mad at me, OK? And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you. And yeah, I know what we had was something special. And at times it was great. But it wasn't love, all right? And deep down, you know that. You're a great girl. And you deserve to be with the perfect guy. - You do. - I do. And I know who the perfect guy for you is. And he's here, right here, right now. Professor. - What? - Barry? - Go on, Professor, tell her. - Tell her what? She's my mortal enemy? I want nothing but her destruction? - Come on, Barry, please. - Please stop calling me Barry. It's true. This guy, he's got a shrine to you in his house. There are pictures of you all over the walls, just of you. This guy, he is hooked on you. He really is. Is that true? Come on. You gotta open your heart to her. It's now or never. It may be a little true. OK, OK, that's a good start. Come on, Barry. Barry, come on. All right, all right! It's completely true. I love you. I've always loved you. But if you love me so much, then how come you're always trying to hurt me? Because you hurt me. Because you broke my heart into a billion pieces. You ignored me. You left me behind. So I thought if I had the powers, you may learn to love me the way I have always loved you. Are you sure? Do you really love me? Oh, yeah. It's over. Can you believe it? I'm free. You were great. I can't believe that fight. I still think she'd kick my butt, but I got a few good punches in. You saved my ass in there. You were wonderful. And I'm really sorry I didn't explain things to you sooner, - but I was just trying to protect you. - I totally understand. Good. - Oh, my God, my hair. - Oh, it doesn't look that bad. You can fix it. Here, try this on. Thanks. See? Adorable. - Yes, you are. - No, not me. - Come here. - Agh! - Tight. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - It's OK. - I'm still getting used to all of this. You and me both. And you know, we're going to have to talk about the relationship too. - Talk? You mean. - Your powers. Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean you have to use 'em, you know what I mean? You're a little scared of me. What? Scared? No, come on, I'm not scared at all. Come here. Are you ready? Yeah! I am. I'm ready. OK. Here we go. OK, all right, I got it. - Hold on, I think I tweaked something. - Oh, you poor baby. What the hell were you doing?! Sorry. Sorry. Oh. I brought it down for you. Peace offering. You've done so much for us. We couldn't be happier. - How.? How.? - Asteroids. Most of that will just buff right out. - I'll fix that. - I could trick it out for you. Rocket launchers, laser cannons, voice-activated battle armor. Do you hear something? - No. - There's a 747 in trouble. It's a 727. Time to go to work. You need a hand? - A hand? - Yeah, any help? I never had any help. - Could be some heavy lifting. - Yeah? - OK. - Yeah? Really? - Yes. - Yes! All right! Whoo! OK, ready. Whoo! Here I go. Yeah! - Love you, honey! - We'll be waiting! What are we gonna do with this stuff? Wanna get a beer? - Sure. - Let's do it. My God! You really do have superpowers. Yeah. Well, it helps when you haven't used them in two years, three months, one week and four days. OK, now. I got one more in me. Here we go. Visiontext Subtitles: Simon Campbell <i>Fifty years ago,</i> <i>an alien force known as the Formics attacked Earth.</i> <i>Tens of millions died.</i> <i>It was only through the sacrifice</i> <i>of our greatest commander</i> <i>that we avoided total annihilation.</i> <i>We've been preparing for them to come back ever since.</i> <i>The International Fleet decided</i> <i>that the world's smartest children</i> <i>are the planet's best hope.</i> <i>Raised on war games,</i> <i>their decisions are intuitive, decisive, fearless.</i> <i>I am one of those recruits.</i> No, I got him. He's poking his head out. <i>I've watched through his eyes,</i> I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. That's what you said about his brother. Brother tested out impossible for other reasons. Nothing to do with his tactical abilities. - I gotcha, I gotcha. - Go around. He's gonna crush him. Come on! You can't do that! You've got to use what's around you. No, no, no. I had you all the way through the belt! You miscalculated your trajectory relative to the incoming asteroid. Don't lecture me, Wiggin! You cheated! It was a good game. Thanks. Hey! <i>Play again.</i> <i>Sorry.</i> <i>- Tomorrow maybe?</i> - You see? He's got a talent for strategy. His humility could be false. Part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing an ego-driven opponent. Which makes him even smarter. He may be a genius, but we need someone the others will follow. A leader. <i>He can't win on his own.</i> <i>Well, let's see how he handles rejection.</i> Andrew Wiggin. <i>Andrew Ender Wiggin,</i> <i>please report to the Infirmary.</i> <i>Ender Wiggin, to the infirmary.</i> - Hello, Ender. - Hello. That nasty monitor is coming out today. Please. Lie face down. Am I off the program? Did I do something wrong? That's not really for me to say. Lie down. The sooner we get this done, the sooner you can move on. Ready? This won't hurt a bit. A-ten-hut! Forward march! Where do you think you're going, Wiggin? Washed out, huh? Come on! - Get him in there! - You're expecting. Come on! Come on, cheat. One on one, for real this time. No game. He's got no monitor now. That's right. No one watching you now, Wiggin. One on one? Then why are your boys holding me? - Let's go. - Come on, man. Stay down. I'm gonna kill you, cheat. Goddamn. Take it easy, Ender! You might be thinking of ganging up on me. But just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me. He said I was cheating. Said that was why I was off the program, - and I kept on kicking him. - It doesn't matter. Even after he was down. He'll never bully you again. All I could think was, "What would Peter do?" I'm just like him, Val. No. No, you are nothing like him, Ender. Nothing like who? I thought you had a game? Rained out. - What's he crying about? - I'm not crying. My monitor's gone. Now I'm just like you. You mean that Mom and Dad spent all that money on a third, and now he's off the program too? Stop it, Peter. He made it farther than either of us. Hey, dropout. Remember how to play Formics and Astronauts? That's it! Where's Mom? No, don't. - I'll play. - Put the mask on. You can be the bug. Peter! You're insane! - Stay out of this, Valentine! - No! Stop it! Alright, bug, you started it, you attack first. Peter! Let me in! Come on! Come on, fight back! At last we got one of you alive! Peter! Stop it! You know, I could kill you, just like this. Peter. Please. I should have been chosen. <i>Deep space Intel shows us</i> <i>that the number of enemy ships already deployed</i> <i>is 10 times those we faced during the first invasion.</i> <i>The Formics are rebuilding and strengthening their fleet.</i> <i>We must conquer or die.</i> Turn it off, please, John. Why? You'd rather not know what's going on in the world? <i>We must never again bear witness</i> <i>to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people,</i> <i>as we did during the Formic invasion.</i> I'd rather you talk to your son. <i>Our survival demands total commitment</i> <i>to the destruction of the enemy.</i> If you want, I'll go away, so you don't have to be embarrassed. Ender, no one is embarrassed. I'm a third. I should never have been born. No. We wanted you, Ender. We just needed permission. John, please say something. It's a tough program, Ender. When they brought me to this country, there was less competition. And still, I didn't make it. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing. <i>Sensor alert.</i> <i>Front door. Please state your name.</i> <i>Colonel Hyrum Graff,</i> <i>Director of Training, International Fleet.</i> <i>This is my colleague, Major Anderson.</i> <i>May we?</i> Why'd you keep kicking him? You'd already won the fight. - Did you enjoy it? - No. Then why? Speak up, son. Knocking him down was the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones too. So they'd leave me alone. Ender, you should have asked a grownup for help. Nonsense. He can fight his own battles. Colonel, he was obviously being bullied - and he defended himself. - Son. I'd like to offer you a place in our program. But you took away my monitor. The final step in our evaluation is always to see what happens when the monitor's removed. And he passed? He put a child in the hospital. It's not what he did. It's why he did it. It was tactical. A strategy to stop future attacks. Ender, you don't have to do this. Ender and I should have a private conversation. - Absolutely not! - With all respect, sir, you really can't stop me. The Formics might have wiped us out the last time, you know. A brilliant commander is the only thing that saved us. Mazer Rackham. Mazer Rackham. We need minds like yours, Ender. Young people integrate complex data more easily than adults. Will the monitor be reinstalled? No. You're graduating. To Battle School. Privacy rights restored. If there is a chance that, because of you, the Formics might leave us alone forever, then I have to ask you to come with me. It's what I was born for, right? <i>Valentine was too compassionate</i> <i>for Battle School.</i> <i>My brother Peter washed out</i> <i>because he was too quick to violence.</i> <i>Colonel Graff said I need to find a balance</i> <i>between those emotions if I were to succeed.</i> Join the others. Go on. - You're late. - Out of my control. I'm Ender. Ender? What kind of name is that? What's your name? Name's Bean. Bean? Grew up on the streets. Not worth a bean. <i>T-minus 10 seconds and counting.</i> <i>T-minus five seconds and counting.</i> <i>Four, three, two, one.</i> - Wow. - Oh. Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna be. A bag! Give him the bag! Whoa! Oh! Are you serious, man? Close the bag! You all right? Mmm. What are you doin', Wiggin? Nothing, sir. Something funny? I asked you a question, Launchie! Sir, the way you're floating. Horizontal. I thought that was funny. Really? Why? Because in zero gravity there is no right side up. You may think you're vertical and we may be horizontal. Is that funny? Sir, no, sir! Yes, it is. Alai, do you know what he's talkin' about? - Yes, sir. - No, you don't. There's only one kid on this launch with any brains at all so far. And that's Ender Wiggin. All new arrivals <i>follow the yellow lights to your accommodations.</i> <i>The yellow lights.</i> Sir, you made them hate me. I told them you were the best. We need a Julius Caesar, - a Napoleon. - We hope that will be you. Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted. And Napoleon lost in the end. Not before he conquered the known world. - Dismissed. - Yes, sir. He has a complicated response to authority. He wants to please the overbearing father figure, but resents a lack of reciprocated affection. His isolation can never be broken. <i>He must never believe anyone will help him.</i> Oh, look! It's the smartass. Thanks. Thought I'd have to ask to be by the door. Speak your name. Ender Wiggin. Don't freeze your balls, kid. Attention on deck! At ease. Listen up, Launchies! My name is Sergeant James Dap. Ask me a legitimate question and I will give you a direct answer. But if you are looking for a shoulder to cry on, use a pillow! Do I look like I'm joking, snots? Sir, no, sir! Good. You are to work as a team. You will all make this bunk room your home. You will keep your home clean! There are separate showers for both sexes. If you're found in an area not designated to your gender, I will personally neuter you! Am I clear? Sir, yes, sir! Class is in five! Follow the yellow lights! Yellow, like your cowardly selves! Sir, yes, sir! <i>Welcome to Battle School.</i> <i>A great responsibility rests upon each of you.</i> <i>When the enemy first invaded, we were not ready.</i> <i>Millions of innocent lives were lost.</i> <i>That must never be allowed to happen again.</i> <i>We threw everything we had at the invaders.</i> <i>And in the midst of that decisive battle,</i> <i>a legendary hero emerged.</i> <i>Eject! Eject!</i> <i>Break away now! Hammer 3!</i> <i>Hammer 2, break left!</i> <i>Bend at left, 7 o'clock.</i> <i>Hammer 2 is hit! Hammer 2 critical!</i> <i>Hammer 1 has been hit!</i> <i>We will never forget what the enemy did.</i> <i>But we defeated them.</i> <i>And we will do so again.</i> <i>Let the courage of Mazer Rackham</i> <i>be your inspiration.</i> Wakey, wakey, rise and shine! Put on your Battle Room suits! That's the padded one with the helmet and the weapon! Do not attempt to fire the weapon! Holster it! Let's move it, Launchies! You've got 10 minutes! At ease. This is the Battle Room. In here, the floor has been designed to create an Earth-like gravitational pull. Step through that gate and you're in a zero-G environment. Wiggin. Get up here. What do I do now, sir? Go on in. All right. Now, push off. Whoa. Pull yourself. Whoa! Grab my hand. No, no! Stop! Stop! Nicely done! These guys are still trying to stay up, the way they came in. Like you said in the shuttle, there is no up or down in space. But we'll need some way to orientate in here. Maybe the enemy's gate is "down." I like it. Like they're a bug to be crushed under our feet. Exactly. What do you think this does? We'll have to find out. Whoa! Well, that's harmless. What do you think it does when it hits the suit? Good question. Shoot me in the leg. We shoot each other. Same time. You ready? In three. two, one. Whoa! My leg's frozen! Mine too! I can't bend my knee. Shoot me in the chest. Come on! I'm getting away! This is amazing! I can't move at all now. You're out of your mind. That's enough. You're flappin' around like a bunch of drunken ducks! If you expect to compete with the other teams at this school, you've got a lot to learn. Sergeant, explain the game. Yes, sir. You will train to compete as a team against other teams. You get one point for a hit to a limb, six for a torso hit, which will immobilize you completely. But, if either side gets one cadet through their enemy's gate unharmed, that army will win, regardless of points already scored. Am I clear? Sir, yes, sir! <i>"Dear Valentine. So this is Battle School.</i> <i>"Every day, hours of training.</i> <i>"And far more homework than we ever had on Earth.</i> <i>"We train in hand-to-hand combat.</i> <i>"It keeps us in shape. And aggressive."</i> And up! And one! Two! Three! <i>"I feel Peter in me whenever I fight."</i> - Wiggin! <i>- "I wish I didn't.</i> <i>"We've been studying Formic flight patterns</i> <i>"for three months now,</i> <i>"but they seem entirely random.</i> <i>"The truth is we really don't understand our enemy.</i> <i>"And no one ever adequately explains</i> <i>"how Mazer Rackham actually defeated the entire fleet.</i> <i>"The Colonel said he expects me to lead.</i> <i>"But how? What makes a good leader?</i> <i>"Everyone here is very different.</i> <i>"So many, many things to learn.</i> <i>"Always very little sleep.</i> <i>"Please write back. I haven 't heard from you.</i> <i>"How are you? Is Peter behaving?</i> <i>"Are you getting my emails? I miss you."</i> Attention on deck! Evening, Launchies. At ease. I'm pleased to see that most of you are performing well. As you know, competition for Command School is tough. Some in the higher ranks have failed to meet our standards, and they're being sent home. So, I may have the opportunity to promote some of you. Look to your left. Look to your right. These are not your friends. They are competition. Keep up the hard work. Attention! Sir? Is our email being blocked? It's just that none of us have received any replies from home. All communication is being temporarily held back. Why, sir? Launchie, it is not your place. Your families will not understand what we're doing here. And none of you need the distraction of their replies. I thought our privacy rights had been restored, sir. You have the right to privately think whatever you wish, Wiggin. But there's too much at stake to allow your unfiltered thoughts to leave this facility. Yes, sir. Keep it up, snot, and you will never make it to Command School. I thought it was a legitimate question. What? You said if we had a legitimate question. Drop and give me 20! You think you're the smartest kid in this school? No, sir. You will never be a commander! I will never salute you! Yes, you will, Sergeant. Give me 20 more! Get up! You do not speak unless spoken to! Am I clear? Sir, yes, sir! Even if I have a legitimate question? Shut it, Wiggin! Now go to sleep! All of you! You heard him. Get some sleep. We have only three passing scores on the deep space navigation test. Alai, Bean and Ender. - What happened here? - They probably cheated. Your mother cheated. That's why you look like a plumber. Zip it! You think this is a game? No, ma'am. - We are preparing for war. - Yes, ma'am. Now, the problem was simple. How do you slingshot your forces into an attack position on the blind side of this moon using the gravitational pull from this planet? This is basic rocket science, people. Ender, get down here and explain. Ma'am, I think Bean or Alai have a better handle on this than I do. All right. Alai, come and explain. Ma'am, we need to approach the planet in the direction it's moving. That way, we benefit from its energy of motion. ls something funny? Go on, Alai. Of course, there's a moon we have to pass here and that complicates things. Because the moon's moving in the opposite direction to us, we get a gravitational braking. Who sent this? Who sent what, Bernard? Nothing, ma'am. Oh. If you can't take it, Bernard, don't dish it out. Yes, ma'am. <i>Welcome to Games and Recreation.</i> <i>Cerebral control enabled.</i> <i>One is poison. One is not.</i> <i>Choose right and you'll go to Fairyland.</i> He's found the Mind Game. <i>Decide or I'll bite your head off.</i> <i>Bad luck.</i> Who authorized his access to this? - I did. <i>- Try again, little mouse.</i> To what end? Not every battle can be won, Hyrum. The way he plays a game reveals his state of mind. If you won't let me assess him one on one, I need some other way to know what he's feeling. I don't care how he's "feeling." I want him to toughen up and learn how to lead. Well, before we make him a leader, let's see how he deals with frustration. Come on! <i>Oh, dear.</i> What you doin'? Playing a stupid game. No matter what I choose, I die. It's rigged. <i>You're back.</i> <i>One more time.</i> Can I watch? Sure. <i>One is poison. One is not.</i> <i>Choose right and you'll go to Fairyland.</i> - Which you gonna choose? - Neither. <i>Come on little mouse, come on.</i> You killed him. Why? That's what they want from us. Follow the rules, you lose. Choose violence, you win. I've never seen anyone do that. Perfect. He's perfect. <i>Ender Wiggin,</i> <i>you are assigned to Salamander Army,</i> <i>Commander Bonzo Madrid,</i> <i>effective immediately. Orders of Colonel Graft'.</i> <i>Follow the green lights. Take nothing with you. Go now.</i> What are they doing? They're promoting you. Ender. Yeah? Peace to you. - Throw! - Come on! - Ball. - Strike two! - Give me the ball. - It hit the wall! - All right. Strike two. - Play ball! You lost, Launchie? I'm Ender Wiggin. Supposed to report to Bonzo Madrid. So you're the replacement? - Ender Wiggin. - Petra Arkanian. Only girl in the Salamander Army. With more balls than anybody else in this bunkroom. Ooh! Mama Petra, she talking! Wiggin? Sir, yes, sir! Ender Wiggin. Reassigned. I ask for a replacement for O'Reilly and this is what I get? A useless, skinny, untrained snot! - I'm a quick study. - Let me be clear. I intend to trade you ASAP. My army is undefeated in the last 21 battles. I'm on track to make it to Command School within six months. You can get your training at someone else's expense. - He's all heart. - Shut it, Petra! Easy, Bonzo. Watch your mouth, Dink. Here's the deal, snot. When we go into battle, you will not pass through the gates until all my soldiers are through. Then you will remain just inside the gate with your weapon undrawn and unfired, until the game ends. So, lam to do nothing? You are to keep out of the way. You bunk at the back of the room. You know, Bonzo doesn't like to lose. He doesn't want an untrained Launchie screwing up his perfect maneuvers. But the Battle Room is open 24/7. During free time, I could show you some moves. You ready? In three, two, one. Impressive. Your turn. Okay, you can't just keep your thumb on the trigger. You need half a second to recharge. At least you don't have any bad habits. I don't have any good ones either. I'll give you those. Relax. The further your target, the longer you have to hold the beam. Fire. Even longer. It's the difference between a tenth and a half-second. But in battle that's a long time. Aim, fire, hold, recharge. That's it. Learn where your trigger actually fires, and ride the edge. Now you're gettin' it! In three, two, one. Go! Let's see who'll beat me! Come on, Dink! You can do it! Once. Just beat me once! - It's over. - Come on. - You can do it. - You got this! That's five in a row! - Who's the boss? - You the boss, Bonzo. That's right. I'm the boss. Let's go again. I'm gonna make this six. Ready? You'll get better with practice. Yeah, let's do it again sometime. Mmm-hmm. That was fun. - Where were you? - Practicing. In free time. You don't practice with her. In fact, you don't practice at all! May I speak to you privately, sir? Hey. Wiggin! Hey! <i>Pendejo!</i> Don't you ever turn your back on me! If I'm gonna be useful in this toon, I have to practice! You will do what I tell you! I will follow all commands you are authorized to give. But if you take away my free time, I will get you iced. Are you threatening me, snot? No. Listen. I know you want to trade me. But no one will take me if I don't know anything. Let me practice. You can get rid of me sooner. I already gave you an order! I know. In front of everybody. And you don't want your soldiers to think that you backed down. So, for tonight, you can say that you won this argument. Then tomorrow, you can tell everybody that you changed your mind. You'll look generous, I'll get to train, we both win. Deal? You'd better watch your back, Wiggin. Wake up! Wake up, <i>mis pendejos!</i> Battle with Leopard in 10 minutes! - Hey, Wiggin! - Yes, sir! I changed my mind. Maybe by watching my toons, you'll learn something and I can trade you easier. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir! Move! Everybody, let's move! <i>Salamander is number one!</i> <i>There's no one like us under the sun</i> <i>'Cause Salamanders, we're on top</i> <i>When it comes to winning, we never stop</i> Salamander halt! At ease. What's the play? Four winds. Toon A, up, B left, C right, D down. You, Wiggin. You hang back near the gate. Bonzo, my toon'll be a man short without him. He knows nothing about our formations, Dink. He'll only get in the way. You come out last. Hang back and observe. We don't need you. Step aside. Go, Salamander! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go, Salamander! Go! Go! We gotta break them up. Fly, you lock with me. Petra rides chariot! - Got it? - Got it! - Ready? - Ready. In three, two, one. - I'm hit! - Me too! Keep shooting, Petra! Body hit her! - Take her out! Go! - I'm on it! Wiggin! What are you doin'? I told you to stay back! Are you okay? What are you doing here? Bonzo will kill you. I can't go back now. Well, then get in the game. We're losing. They've got half their toon back near their gate. Put your feet to mine. Redirect me. Play dead. Don't draw your weapon till you know you have a shot. Got it. In three, two, one. Smart move, holding Wiggin back. Where'd you learn all this? I had a brother. - Had? - Have. Come on. Let's go again. But use your arms, not your hips. Officer on deck! A-ten-hut! I thought I told you not to train with her. I thought we'd agreed that free time was free, sir. At ease. Stop it, Bonzo! Try making me look like a fool again and I'll kill you. Are you okay? Yeah. What do you want me to do? Valentine? How can you be in my game? <i>Ah!</i> Well done. <i>You're a killer now.</i> Nightmares, Launchie? Keep 'em to yourself. <i>You said the game would reveal his state of mind,</i> <i>not screw with it!</i> How did his psycho brother end up in the game? <i>He's obviously feeling some psychological pressure.</i> Of course he's feeling pressure, Anderson! This is a boot camp for kids that are gonna have to face a real enemy! <i>The game is a thought relationship</i> <i>between the child and the computer.</i> <i>Together they create stories.</i> Then change the story! <i>The stories reflect the child's emotional reality.</i> <i>I can't change that!</i> <i>I don't know how these images got into the game.</i> Erase the game. Doin' well. Very well. Top test scores in class. Highest Battle Room ratings. But you have a habit of upsetting your commander. I find it hard to respect someone just because they outrank me, sir. Puts you in a difficult position, doesn't it? Yes, sir. You don't like taking orders from Bonzo. No, sir. Perhaps you'd prefer to give them yourself? Sir? How would you like to lead your own army? Dragon Army. Sir, I've never heard of a Dragon Army. We discontinued the name four years ago. No Dragon Army ever won a battle. Then why not a new name, sir? Because we already have the uniforms. And who will be in this army, sir? Misfits. Like you. Oddballs who might just be brilliant with the right commander. Your new quarters. Your soldiers are being notified now. You will address them in 15 minutes. Do you think they'll follow me? A-ten-hut! Officer on deck. At ease. Welcome to Dragon Army. Bunking will be arranged with youngest at the front and veterans at the back. Ender, every other commander has their seniors closest to the door. Well, I don't intend to be like every other commander. What am I doing here, Ender? You don't even like me. I didn't select this army, Bernard. But I intend to make it the best in this school. I think you can help make that happen. Am I wrong? No, sir. You will respect one another. If anybody has an idea they think is better than mine, I wanna hear it. I can't be expected to do all the thinking in this army, can I, Bean? - No, sir! - Then let's get suited up. - Training starts now! - Sir, yes, sir! He's pushing them hard. Might even make something of Bernard. Command School is pressing for a decision. Tell them we need more time. We're out of time. Lieutenant. Tomorrow's game will commence at 0300. Yes, sir. Wake up! Wake up! Battle with Salamander and Leopard! In five! Two armies at once? The Colonel is changing the rules! In a battle with the Formics, there will be no rules. You all right? I twisted my ankle. How bad? Not good. Dink, get him to the infirmary. The rest of you, let's move! Come on! We're late! Come on! They already opened the gate? Petra? Two armies weren't enough? They had to block your view too? What are you doing here? Colonel said you needed a sub. Guess he thought your odds were zero with me on the other team. Bonzo agree to this? - Colonel Graff's orders. - He didn't have a choice. Dink. Kneel. - What? - I have an idea. Kneel. Ready? In three, two, - one! - Fire now! Shoot 'em! Fire! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out! Twelve clear on the wall! Twelve down, 20 to go. They could be right behind these forward stars or all the way back at their gate. - Ready? - Ready. Now! Pull! Dumbos have a bunch of stars around their gate like a giant donut! They're just hanging behind 'em. - No one closer? - Nah. Nice. Let's see how they handle a formation. We've never done a formation. Then they won't expect one. We still outnumber him. We should storm him and crush him. No. We hold our positions. He has to come to us. We can't lose. Open fire! They're drifting upwards! On my count, row two, push row one! We're changing direction, 30 degrees! In three, two, one. NOW! Rear thrusters, row six. Now! Row five. Now! Come on. Don't let them through. We've gotta break them up! We're almost there! - I'm hit! - Hold on! Alai, are you okay? - Yeah! Are we there yet? - Almost! Keep close! - Alai can't get hit! - We're nearly there! Keep shooting! We did it! Yeah! Eat that! Dragon rules! Yes! - Who's undefeated now? - Dragon! Still think he's not ready? Don't be smug. Yeah! Did you see the look on Bonzo's face? We're tired of you, Ender. You know, your father would be proud. Come to fight a boy in the shower. With your buddies. Go watch the door. Go! Look. You can say you won. I'll say you taught me a lesson. No, coward. Raise your fists. Come out and fight! Come on! Come on, fight! Come on! I could break your arm! Bonzo? Bonzo! Bonzo? Help! We need help in here! Everybody knows he started it. Ender. - I am so sorry. - Major! We should never have allowed you to be alone. Not now, Major! Leave us. Leave him. Now. You too, cadet. He's gonna die, isn't he? No. No. Please, don't lie to me. We're gonna send him home. Back to Earth. So he can get better. I want to go with him. I can't let you go. You've come so far. And I wanna talk to my sister. The Fleet owns you, Ender. Strategos would never allow it. Send me home, Colonel, or I will resign. Don't threaten me, boy. I am not the enemy. I'm not so sure. I won't play this game anymore. I quit. What are you gonna do? Waste millions on a loser? You wanted to see me. You can't resign. You have an obligation to stay here and convince him to do his duty. My father trained horses. I've raised yearlings since I was five years old. I know a thoroughbred when I see one. We can't lose him. My God. You really don't see them as children, do you? It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15. When the war is over we can have the luxury of debating the morality of what we do. When it's over, what will be left of the boy? What does it matter if there's nothing left at all? We're using these children to win a war. And if they come home, it's my job to put them back together again. Thanks for what you've done. - Where's Ender? - Hello, Valentine. Why are you here? Did something happen? They won't let me see him. I need you to take a ride with me. He's gonna be happy to see you. Come on. You just want him to re-enlist. I want him to save lives. And what about his life? I've been sitting by Bonzo's bed, waiting for him to wake up. But he may never wake up. Ender, he attacked first. And I fought back, just like Peter taught me. I've had a lot of fights, Val. I've won because I've always understood the way my enemy thinks. And when I truly understand them. you also love them. I think it's impossible to truly understand someone and not love them the way they love themselves. - But in that moment. - You beat them. I destroy them. I make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again. Ender, they want me to talk you into going back. I told them I won't cooperate. I don't think you're hiding here just because you care about Bonzo. I think you're hiding because you're afraid. Afraid you don't know your enemy. Afraid you might lose. But what if you're the next Mazer Rackham? You can't hide here forever. But if you stay here, if you don't try, then we will all be lost. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. I need to know that you will not block my emails again. <i>Attention,</i> <i>prepare for transporter docking operation.</i> <i>Initiating final approach.</i> I thought we were going back to Battle School. - We're not. - Where are we going? Much further. <i>"Dear Valentine.</i> <i>"I must now travel to our advanced command base</i> <i>"near the Formics' home planet,</i> <i>"where I'll begin final training.</i> <i>"If successful, I'll command the entire invasion fleet.</i> <i>"I wish there was another way, but war seems inevitable.</i> <i>"Stay safe. Love, Ender."</i> Not very hospitable, is it? We took it from the Formics 27 years after Rackham's victory. Flushed them out of these tunnels like rats from a sewer. Drove 'em all the way back to their home planet. - How long did they live here? - We're not sure. This was a forward staging post for their invasion of Earth. We built our base hereto be closer to their home planet, to allow instantaneous communication by Ansible with our attack fleet. If they're on their home planet, do we have them contained? For now. If we have them boxed in, why go to war? For the same reason that you kept kicking that bully before I recruited you. The purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars. Your training begins first thing tomorrow morning. Sergeant Dap will show you to your quarters. Yes, sir. We're still re-seeding the atmosphere. It's breathable, but thin. In the event of an evacuation, two breaths every minute from one of these will compensate for lower levels of surface oxygen. Lights out in five. Who are you? Look, this may be amusing to you, but they'll come looking for me. You wanna fight me? Is that the test? To see if I'll attack an old man? Well, I won't. I'll just sit this one out. Okay. You win. Since when do you tell the enemy when he has won? I surprised you once. Why didn't you destroy me immediately after? I thought you were a teacher. There is no teacher but the enemy. Only he will tell you where you are weak, where he is strong. From now on, I am your enemy, got it? - Yes. - Good. During training, I will devise the strategy of your enemy. Remember, he is stronger than you. From now on, you are always about to lose. Sir? Do you have a name? Mazer Rackham. What? You thought I was dead? Sir, I've been building models of your planes since I was six years old. I have a question, sir. On the vids, they always cut out right after you destroy the one carrier. Why? Get dressed. Sir, I've already seen this. And I wanna know what happens after. Just watch. After the explosion cleared, everything was incredibly still. Their ships just stopped shooting. And then they started falling out of the sky. Scroll back, please. To just after you lost your wing man. There. Play back, please. You took cover in the cloud. You couldn't see anything, so you must have been using your HUD. There. Stop. You saw something. What did you see in your HUD? Did you find a pattern? Very good, Ender. Thermal imaging from a satellite. The enemy's in red. What pattern do you see? It seems random. But it's not. There's an epicenter, right there. Meaning? You took out that one particular ship, and the rest just gave up? Why? To what animals are the Formics most often compared? - Ants. - Which have. A queen. Who directs the worker ants. What she thinks they do. Without her, they can't think for themselves. And they die. You destroyed the queen's ship. I must have. Yes. - But you can't be certain? - No. And so the Hegemon insisted we keep it classified. That's why they never show the rest of the battle. Or my face. To the world I'm dead. Colonel. Your face. You mean, why is it marked? My father was a Maori. Lost him in the war. Ta Moko is a way to connect to my past. To my inner skin. It was a way for me to speak for the dead. Sir, have you ever seen a queen? No. No one has. But if the Formics have rebuilt their fleet, there must be more than one queen. Yes, of course. On their home planet. What happened when you attacked here? - Did you find one? - No. Why did they come? Water. Attention! Officer on deck! - Hey, Bean. - Ho, Commander! Petra. We thought you were iced. We were gonna have to have Dink take over. That was never gonna happen! <i>Salaam,</i> Alai. <i>Salaam,</i> Commander! - Bernard. - Good to see you, sir. At ease. While you've been skinny-dipping the Colonel's been flogging us to death on the simulator! All right. Take your seats. In a matter of weeks we may be called on to fight a real battle. Let's bring your commander up to speed. Our latest probe images will give you an idea of what's happening on the enemy planet. Like us, they appear to have a population growth rate that's unsustainable. For now, they're contained on their planet. Time is not on our side. Where are they? High surface temperatures limit their above-ground activity to just a few hours a day. What's most alarming is the rate at which their military power is expanding. But they have not yet moved against us. No. They're planning to colonize another planet before they breed themselves into extinction. Our orders are to defeat them before they pose an irreversible threat. Their very existence is a threat. Is that clear, Commander? - Clear, sir. - Good. Carry on, Colonel. We will begin with photo real simulations to best approximate real battles. You will command overall strategy. Your toon leaders will each command a battle group. You will issue orders to them. They will issue orders to their squadrons of drone pilots. Finally. Your entire fleet must support and protect your most important asset. Seventy billion dollars of pure destruction. The M.D. 500. Which Petra is trained to fire. M.D.? Molecular Detachment Device. We call her "the little Doctor." Particle beams accelerate from her twin barrels. At the focus point, they reach critical effective mass. A chain reaction spreads outwards, shattering molecular bonds. Leaves nothing standing. That's the beauty of the little Doctor. No need to identify a specific ship for the queen. The chain reaction takes out an entire swarm. But I'll only get one shot. Once the Formics see how she works, they won't clump together again. You will have to win this war one battle at a time. <i>Once our battle fleet is detected</i> <i>entering the Formic solar system,</i> <i>we will have no alternative but to engage.</i> <i>I trust we have chosen our commander well.</i> There's greatness in him, sir. <i>And a killer instinct too, I hope.</i> Absolutely. <i>Let's hope he's all you claim him to be.</i> <i>We'll be with you soon.</i> <i>Goodnight.</i> Goodnight, sir. <i>"Dear Valentine. So this is Command School.</i> <i>"I'm finally here.</i> <i>"Being a third, I've always been so afraid I might fail.</i> <i>"That I might not measure up.</i> <i>"But they made me a leader.</i> <i>"And I promise you that I'll do everything I can to win this war.</i> <i>"I know if anything ever happened to you,</i> <i>"I would never forgive myself."</i> What are they doing? Harvesting water. If you're going to use me, I need to be closer. Too risky. Let's not reveal our best weapon in what should be an easy attack. Alai, Bean, your Dreads peel away. Track them from below the ice and mirror their path. They're swarming! - They see us! - Deploy all drones! Give me four hyperbolic formations with 90 degree offsets! Open fire! Bean, Alai, on my call, fire directly up into the ice! We're gonna shred 'em! - In three, two, one. - All right! NOW! <i>"As our training progresses,</i> <i>"the simulations are becoming more and more complex, and real.</i> <i>"The pressure to win, day after day,</i> <i>“month after month, is intense.</i> <i>"We get very little sleep.</i> <i>"Some days, it's hard to keep up."</i> - I got the breakaway! - Great work, Bean! Squadrons 43 through 57, split to quadrant Foxtrot, 38, 89! Ender, watch our right flank! We need backup for Bernard. I see it! Bernard, you flank them! Copy that. Using 10 through 18! Alai, peel right! Dink, compensate for the pull of planet G8 and go full throttle! Bean, mop up in sector Sierra! I got a sprinter left in Lima! Do Sierra now! Bernard, watch your speed! Dink, you are closing too fast! - You said full throttle! - Pull back now, Dink! We can't absorb these kind of losses! War isn't a game where you get to reboot and start over! Sir, I can't win if I don't take any risks. Nobody's saying not to take risks. Just don't try and control everything. Let Bean improvise in the mop-ups. You focus on the big picture. - Delegate more to your teams! - My teams are burned out! How can they be effective if they don't get any sleep? Sleep deprivation is part of your training! A battle with the Formics could last for days! If I'd been smarter, I could have annihilated Petra's little Doctor while you were micro-managing Bean! That can't happen, understand? - Yes, sir. - Do you? 'Cause I've trained others. Each one so hopeful. Each one ultimately a failure. All right, Colonel. He understands. So I'm not the first? No. But you will be the last. There's no time to train anyone else. Son, tomorrow Colonel Rackham will run your final simulation. And if I win tomorrow? What happens? You will be ready to face the real enemy. And you will be the finest commander we've ever trained. <i>One more simulation and I may have to go to war.</i> <i>What happens when it's no longer a game?</i> <i>Real war is different.</i> <i>I still know nothing about my enemy.</i> What if they could talk to us? <i>They can't.</i> <i>Dissections show no vocal chords.</i> There are other ways to communicate. <i>Ender, this is not a conversation</i> <i>we should be having at 1:00 a.m.</i> What if they could "think" to one another? What if we could "think" to them? <i>We need to sleep.</i> <i>We have a graduation battle tomorrow.</i> Right. We're gonna get crushed. <i>We won't be crushed. We have you.</i> <i>Now go to sleep.</i> Goodnight, Petra. <i>Goodnight, Ender.</i> You still think he's "the one"? We're committed. This boy has the empathy to think like a Formic. To understand them, anticipate them. He's not ready. You're never "ready." You go when you're "ready enough." Easy, sir. It's graduation day. Good luck, sir. Attention! At ease. Sir. We have an audience. Commander Wiggin, the Strategos is here today to witness your final simulation. If you are successful, he will endorse your promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet. Yes, sir! This simulation is staged around the enemy's home planet. Good luck, Commander. Thank you, sir. Stay calm. Shoot straight. Here we go. They're waiting. Maybe they think we come in peace. I don't think Mazer intends for us to find a diplomatic solution. What's he waiting for? Just give him a minute. Ender, what do we do? Ender. The enemy's gate is down. Petra. You're up. They're spread too wide for a chain reaction. She's right. Just let him follow his instincts. All battle groups deploy drones. Protect your carriers. Alai! You're squadron five! Engage! This is suicide. Oh, crap. They're swarming. Clumped enough for you now, Petra? Once I fire I need time to recharge. Understood. Just go for the center. Fire now! She did it. Yeah. Give me false color. We're not done yet. - But we are so screwed. - No, we're not. - Charged, Petra? - No. I need two minutes. All fighters fall back and surround Petra's ship! Copy that. I want rings within rings. Layers upon layer. Every fighter we have! Ender, you're gonna leave our transporters defenseless! If we're gonna win this battle, Dink, it's all or nothing now! When the outer layer is hit, the wreckage will continue to drift with us, like a shield. Do it now! He's abandoning his entire fleet. He's in command. There's no stopping him now. Ninety seconds, Ender! No, no. No! I'm losing my carriers! My Dreadnaughts are out! I don't care about Dreadnaughts! Just protect Petra! Like we protected Alai when we fought Bonzo! I hope you know what you're doing. - Ready, Petra? - In 60 seconds! What am I aiming for? The planet. What? If we destroy the planet, we destroy the queens. Game over. Ender, my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight! We will clear a path! All fighters maintain a clockwise rotation! Focus all firepower forward! Ender, we're entering their atmosphere! We need to slow down! We can't! We're one unit now. We're not equipped to handle the heat of passage through an atmosphere! Our drones are our heat shield. Keep falling. Let gravity do the work. The shield won't hold forever! We don't need forever. Thirty seconds! I still don't have a clear shot. - We're burning up! - Bean, on my count, accelerate your fighters from the nose of the formation - in a continuous stream. - Yes, sir! Like bullets from a rifle, you will clear a visual for Petra! We will drill a hole through this swarm! Petra, you will only get a second. That's all I need! In three, two, one. Now, Bean! Shield integrity's at 5%! - Now, Petra! Now! - Seven seconds! They've broken the shield! Fire, Petra! We're out of time! - We did it! Yeah! - Yes! - Great job, Ender! - Yes! Thank you! Good game, Ender! Good job, guys! Yeah! How about that? Game over. What's he saying? Restoring Ansible connection. What is this? Why are we watching these images? Ender. Thank you. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Thank God for you, son. Why are these images in the program? Ender. We won. What do you mean, "we won"? I beat him. <i>He runs the simulations. He said it was a game!</i> It was them or us, Ender. There was no other way. With this victory, you've won all future battles. You destroyed them. For all of us. Stand down. Move, move, please! - Move! - Make a way. - Ender. - Stay away from me! - You lied! - Son, we were afraid - if we told you, you might. - What? Refuse to play? I've killed an entire species! They would have done the same to us. No! They waited. What were they waiting for? Who cares? We lost 1,000 men on the transporters you abandoned! I abandoned them in order to win! Yes! And they died proudly! For us! They might not have died at all! If I'd known it was real, - I would have. - What? Called for "a dialogue?" They can't even speak. Watched them! What were they thinking? Were they building an army for a second invasion? Or. Or simply preparing to defend themselves. Ender, stop. from us? They came to Earth to establish a colony. We chased them away. And in 50 years, they never returned. Makes no difference now. I will bear the shame of this genocide forever. No. You will be remembered as a hero! I will be remembered as a killer! It was us or them. And you're sure we've killed every last one of them? I saw their whole planet destroyed. How do you know there isn't another colony? - Or another queen out there? - There isn't! We won! - That's all that matters. - No. The way we win matters. Don't hurt him. Go on. We need to let him rest. May I stay with him? Just so he's not alone. Please? Yes, of course. Come on. Just let him rest. <i>What if they could talk to us?</i> <i>What were they thinking?</i> Valentine! <i>What if we could "think" to them?</i> Valentine! Ender! Ender, wait! Ender! What are you doing, Ender? - I know what she wants! - Ender! Warning, <i>you are leaving an oxygen-balanced environment.</i> Ender, stop! It's not safe! Ender! Breathe. Just breathe. In the mind game, I saw this place. What are you talking about? The Formics accessed the game through me. Their thoughts. My dreams. All mixed together. They were trying to communicate. What are you doing? Go back. No. Please. I have to do this. <i>"Dear Valentine.</i> <i>"I now know my dreams were never my own.</i> <i>"They came from her.</i> <i>"She was always trying to communicate with me.</i> <i>"I know the Formics better than any living soul.</i> <i>"I stole their future from them.</i> <i>"Now I must find a way to make amends."</i> You're dying. Is it a queen? I will find a new home. I promise. <i>"I miss you, Valentine.</i> <i>"You won't be hearing from me for a while.</i> <i>"I need to find out</i> <i>"if I'm as gifted at peace as I am at war.</i> <i>"They've awarded me the rank of Admiral</i> <i>"and left me to my own devices.</i> <i>"Which suits me fine.</i> <i>"I'll travel the universe</i> <i>"and carry with me a precious cargo.</i> <i>"Because I have a promise to keep."</i> Day 1,000 of the siege of Seattle. The Muslim community demands an end to the Army's occupation of mosques. The Homeland Security bill is ratified. After eight years, British borders will remain closed. The deportation of illegal immigrants will continue. Good morning. Our lead story. The world was stunned today by the death of Diego Ricardo, the youngest person on the planet. Baby Diego was stabbed outside a bar in Buenos Aires after refusing to sign an autograph. Witnesses at the scene say. Excuse me. .that Diego spat in the face of a fan who asked for an autograph. He was killed in the ensuing brawl. The fan was later beaten to death. Coffee, please. Black. .by the angry crowd. Born in 2009, the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo, a working-class couple from Mendoza, he struggled all his life with the celebrity status thrust upon him as the world's youngest person. Diego Ricardo, the youngest person on the planet was 18 years, 4 months, 20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old. Throughout his life, Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder of the 18 years of infertility that humanity has endured and its effect upon the world we now live in. It seems that the mantle of the world's youngest human has passed to a woman. She is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old. - Faron. - Mr. Griffiths. I seem to be more affected by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir. If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it if I could finish my day's work at home. .generation needs to reject family and society. - He's my dentist. - She's my house cleaner. - He's the waiter. - She's my cousin. They are illegal immigrants. To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime. It's your life. It's your choice. Hey, amigo! Jasper! Good to see you. Come on. You know who did it? Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows. I'll bet it was the government. Every time one of our politicians is in trouble, a bomb explodes. It's the second time in a month. - You okay? - It was horrible. I'm glad you don't take cream or sugar, amigo. Losing you and Baby Diego on the same day would be too hard to bear. Well, that was even worse, everybody crying. I mean, Baby Diego, come on. That guy was a wanker. Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker on Earth. Pull my finger. Quick, quick! Jasper. Fucking hell! That's disgusting! Illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill. Poor fugees. After escaping the worst atrocities and finally making it to England, our government hunts them down like cockroaches. - Any girls? - No. What about the one we had lunch with? Lauren? Lorna. That was ages ago. - I liked her. What happened? - She decided to renounce. Renouncers? Are those the ones that kneel down for a month for salvation? No. They're the Repenters. The Renouncers flagellate themselves for the forgiveness of humanity. Oh, right. Dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo? - What'd you do on your birthday? - Nothing. Come on. You must've done something. No. Same as every other day. Woke up, felt like shit, went to work, felt like shit. That's called a hangover, amigo. At least with a hangover, I feel something. Honestly, Jasper, sometimes. You could always come and live with us. Yeah, but if I did that, I wouldn't have anything to look forward to. Look who it is. It's Theo. - Hey, Janice, how you doing? - It's Theo. Your rebel with a lost cause. She loves this color. Don't you, darling? You love it. "Is there a chance it will not work for me? "There have been no cases of anyone surviving "who has taken the preparation." Daddy government hands out suicide kits and anti-depressants in the rations, but ganja is still illegal. Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now. This bloke buys it from me and smuggles it in. Guess what he does? His real job? Immigration cop. Bravo! One of the many perks of having a refugee camp in the neighborhood. Come on, taste that. Cough. - Cough? - Cough. You taste it? Strawberries. This is Strawberry Cough. So, Human Project is having this dinner and all the wisest men in the world are there. "Human Project." Why do people believe this crap? You know, even if these people existed with these facilities in secret locations. Fuck me, that's strong. Even if they discovered the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter. Too late. The world went to shit. You know what? It was too late before the infertility thing happened, for fuck's sake. I was just trying to tell a joke, man. I'm sorry. Go on. - No, I'm not telling it now. - No, come on, Jasper. - No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you. - It's all right. Go on. Okay. The Human Project gives this great big dinner for all the scientists and sages in the world. They're tossing around theories about the ultimate mystery, why are women infertile? Why can't we make babies anymore? Some of them say it's genetic experiments, gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old. Anyway, in the corner, this Englishman's sitting. He hasn't said a word. He's just tucking into his dinner. So they decide to ask him. They say, "Well, why do you think we can't make babies anymore?" And he looks up at them, and he's chewing on this great big wing, and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea," he said. "But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?" Eating a fucking stork. Eating the stork. Italia. You okay, amigo? Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier. Well, a little Zen music won't bother you, then, will it? Good morning. The time is 7:59 a.m. British citizens, hold out your I.D. cards. All others, follow instructions. What the fuck? Move along! Move along! This is him. - Get your fucking head down! - Walk! - Get your fucking head down! - Okay. Okay. - Get in! - Get him in! Get him in! Get his fucking legs. Go, go, go, go! You are under the jurisdiction of the Fishes. The Fishes are at war with the British government until they recognize equal rights for every immigrant in Britain. We're not gonna hurt you. We just want to talk. But don't do anything stupid. - Uncover him. - It isn't safe. Do it. Hello, Theo. It's me, Theo. It's Julian. You scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry about the theatrics, but we had no choice. The police have been a pain in the ass lately. How have you been? Fantastic. Couldn't be better. Cut the lights. The police keep using that old photo of you in the posters. It doesn't do you justice. What do the police know about justice? What exactly is it you guys do, anyway? The Fishes fight for equal rights for every immigrant in Britain! He knows what we do. I know you almost blew me up in a coffee shop yesterday. My ears are still ringing. - We don't bomb. - That was the government. That's what they do to spread the fear. What about Liverpool? After Liverpool, we stopped bombing. We started speaking to the people. And they're joining us, Theo. British people, too. I don't talk politics. - That's all you ever used to do. - That was 20 years ago. I'm a lot more successful now. Come on, Theo. Walk with me. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Come on! - You're smoking? - Yeah. It's not working. I heard about your mother. I'm sorry. Were your parents in New York when it happened? - Yeah. - Shit. Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now, isn't it? Why am I here, Jules? I need your help. I need transit papers. Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee. Need to get her to the coast, past security checkpoints. I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years and you come asking me for transit papers? - Can you do it? - I don't see how. You could ask your cousin. The government finances his Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers. - Yeah, but he'd never do it. - He would if you asked him. I can't. It's too dangerous. I can get you £5,000. I know you need the money. What are you talking about? - I don't fucking need your money. - Right. Sorry. My mistake. You know that ringing in your ears? That. That's the sound of the ear cells dying. Like their swan song. Once it's gone, you'll never hear that frequency again. Enjoy it while it lasts. This never fucking happened, so don't go telling tales, 'cause we'll be watching you. At work, when you sleep, when you have a piss, we'll be watching. All the fucking time. Jeez, your breath stinks. - No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does. It was Julian's idea bringing you here. She put herself at great risk. Now you know about the five grand we can offer you. So if you change your mind, pin this to the notice board at Camden tube. We'll do the rest. Here you are. Bus fare. Earthquakes! Pollution! Disease and famine! Our sins have encouraged God's wrath! And in his anger he has taken away his most precious gift to us! Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you. This way, sir. I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility. You got something in your teeth. If you'll excuse me. Couldn't save La Pietà. Smashed up before we got there. Pretty rummy, huh? My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom. It was a lamp. Good to see you, Theo. We got to keep Las Meninas and a few other Velásquezes, but we only got a hold of two Goyas. That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art. Not to mention people. How's Martha? She's doing her animal charity thing. Sends her love. - Give her my best. - Yes. Why did you come, Theo? Well, the thing is, I met this girl. Cute? Beautiful. Is it serious? Very. She's got this brother in Brighton and she hasn't seen him for about five years, and he's not doing too good. I mean, pretty sick. - I don't think he's gonna make it. - Sorry. I've got money. I was just hoping that you might. I was hoping you could get us the transit papers to get to the coast. - Transit papers? That's quite a favor. - I know. Highly controlled. Alex, take your pills. Alex. Alex? Alex! Come with me. I'm really sorry, Nigel. I just don't know who else to ask. I'll see what I can do. What? You kill me. A hundred years from now, there won't be one sad fuck to look at any of this. What keeps you going? You know what it is, Theo? I just don't think about it. - Where's Julian? - She couldn't make it. Sends her best. Here's a photo of the girl and her name. Hang on. We got a problem. All I could get were joint transit papers, which means I would have to escort the girl. Will you? For a couple more grand. Julian thinks very highly of you. Does she? Yeah. Thanks again. Go on, stay with her. Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes! Have you seen this dog? I'll be one minute. Billy! I'm in a rush, mate. Okay, Theo. He'll see to you. He'll see to you. I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on. That's 70 quid. Shit. - She's my house cleaner. - He's the plumber. Jesus. - He's my dentist. - He's the waiter. She's my cousin. They are illegal immigrants. To hire, feed or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime. Protect Britain. Report all illegal immigrants. Did you get the papers? Lovely to see you, too. Thank you. I really appreciate this. Just like the old days, back of the bus. Yeah, except we're the old farts now. - You're looking good. - Right. Seriously. Look at me. It's hard for me to look at you. He had your eyes. You know, I never understood how you got over it so quickly. You think I got over it? No one could get over it. I live with it. I think about him every day. Come on, I mean the way you just. You don't have a monopoly on suffering, you know. You always carried his memory like a ball and chain. What do you fucking know about my memories? - You don't know what I feel or what. - Move! Yeah, there you go. That's what you always do. When it gets tough, you walk away. This is our stop. Thelonius! So why did you come to me? You could have found other ways to get transit papers. Probably. - So why me? - I trust you. - And what happens after? - You take a train back. It'll be safer. No, I mean what happens to us? I don't know. Theo, come on. You came for the money. Did I? Theo? - You got my money? - See? We'll take you down to the first checkpoint on the Canterbury Road, then you and Kee are on your own. Well, this is obviously the elite unit. - This is Miriam. - Hi. - Is this the girl? - Kee, this is Theo. What the fuck you staring at? Apparently the pleasure's all mine. Are we planning a sing-along? Good. I'm gonna take a nap. The afternoon is looking good here on Radio Avalon. And now one for all the nostalgics out there, a blast from the past all the way back from 2003. That beautiful time when people refused to accept the future was just around the corner. Hey. You're snoring. - No, I wasn't. - Yes, you were. He always snored. Where are we? Canterbury. We're close. Anyone know if there's a hotel around here? What? Julian promised me a little bit of action. You still like it in the afternoon? So what did you do? Rob a train? Blow up a building? Leave the girl alone. You told me he was suave. Wanker's a drunk. He's suave. You should have seen him in the old days when he was a real activist. You were the activist, I just wanted to get laid. One time the police came to throw us out of our squat and Theo invited them up for coffee to negotiate, only the coffee was spiked with ketamine. No! You didn't, did you? Fuck off. You gotta be kidding. You know how many people I've tried this with? I don't wanna know. You'll be happy to know out of the hundreds. - Hundreds? - .you are still the only one. - I'm not doing it. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. The car's moving too much. - Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You are. Ready? Thelonius! No, wait, wait. Okay. Do it again! Do it again! Julian, that's disgusting! Look out! Jesus! Shit! Go! Go! We're gonna make it. Come on, we're gonna make it. No, I'm not gonna make it! I'm not gonna make it! - Christ! - Back up! Back up now! Jesus! Oh, save us! Save us in our hour of need! Blessed Mary, save us. Christ, Jesus! - He's got a gun! - Cover Kee! Get down! Oh, my God! She's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot. - How is she? How is she? - She's bleeding! She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere! Shit! Julian. Put pressure on the wound! Please, please, please. Please, please. Oh, no. Oh, no. Julian. Jesus Christ! Julian! It's the cops. It's the cops. Did they see us? Keep going. Speed up. Are they coming back? What's happening? Faster! Faster! - Are they coming back? - I don't know. Just go faster! Can't you pull off the road? - All right, slow down. Slow down! - I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them. - Stop the car. - I gotta stop. I gotta stop. Pull over to the side of the road. Stop the car! Get your passports out! Stay inside the vehicle! We're British citizens! We're British citizens! - British citizens! - Hands on the steering wheel! Hands on the steering wheel! Calm down. Tell me what happened! We were attacked! We gotta take her to a hospital. Okay. Just wait. I'm gonna call for assistance. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Get in the car. - Why did you do that? Get in the fucking car! Get back in now. Quickly. We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in. Go! Go! Go! We have to call on help now. Put your hands out. Fucking shit. May all the ascended beings, the bodhisattvas and saints and all those who have walked the surface of the earth in the light of eternal truth, come to the aid of our beloved sister, Julian. Theo! Come on! Theo, come on! This is Tomasz and Emily's farm. I already called and told them the situation. We'll be safe here. Fishes are coming in to vote for a new leader. - Ian? - Yeah. - We have to convene. - Everyone's arriving. - Are you all right? - Yeah, it's not my blood. - Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee. - Welcome. Miriam. They need to wash up and rest. How about Julian's mate? Yeah, can somebody give me a lift back to London? No, no, no. It's too dangerous. We'll sort it tomorrow. Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt. Tomasz, don't block the car in. It needs to be jump-started. Ian? Yeah. They like you. And they don't like anyone. - You did what you could. - We need to show strength and unity. - The shirt fit? - Yeah, it's fine. Thanks. I'll take care of this. As head Fishes, we need to make a choice now. We need to choose leadership. I don't think that those bloodstains will wash off. Don't worry about it. Throw it away. - I'm in charge of watching you. - Why? They told me. Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow. I lived there once. Didn't like it. No. They kill you. - Where you from? - Poland. Is this your place? My missus. She's a cod. - English Fish. - Mr. Faron. Kee would like a word with you. She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz. I'll watch him. Hey, don't smoke in the barn. To Luke, our new leader. Luke. - To Luke. - Luke. I'll be right outside. You know what they do to these cows? They cut off their tits. They do. Gone. Bye. Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine. It's wacko. Why not make machines that suck eight titties? Is that what you want to talk about? Cows and titties? Julian told me about your baby. Said his name was Dylan. You taught him to swim when he was two. He called you "Papa." She said if anything goes spooky, I should talk to you. Said you'd help me, said you'd get me to the boat. - What boat? - The Tomorrow. The Tomorrow? I don't know what you're talking about. But I'm sure your friends can take care of you. But Julian said only trust you. She said you'd help me. I don't know why she said that. Listen, I don't quite know what's going on. - You can't leave. - Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself. - I'm sorry. - Wait! What are you doing? Don't do that. I'm scared. Please help me. Jesus Christ. - Kee! Kee! - What are you doing? - Are you all right? - She wanted him to know. She has the right. Of course she has. For God's sake. When you're ready, come inside. Everybody's arrived. - She's pregnant. - Now you know what's at stake. - But she's pregnant. - Yeah, I know. It's a miracle, isn't it? Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor was killed today in a gun battle with police near Canterbury. Four other terrorists escaped after murdering two officers. Police say they have sufficient forensic and surveillance evidence to identify the four killers. All suspects should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. This was broadcast an hour ago. We have to assume it's just a matter of time before they identify the rest of us, which includes you, Theo. - Why is he here? - He's not a Fish. - He's not one of us. - I want him here. Kee wants him, he stays. Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our brothers and sisters in the Human Project. - Right. - Now we got to reevaluate that position. No, there's no need. We move forward with the original plan. Yes! She'll never make it. The police are looking for her. We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted. We'd be risking the girl's life. Listen, listen! She belongs here. And this baby is the flag that could unite us all! We said we'd never use this baby for political purposes. My baby's not a flag. Make it public! What? - What? - What? Excuse me? You should make it public. You saw the telly. She's about to be very public. It doesn't matter. She's pregnant. Oh, right. And then the government will say, "We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too." Well, whatever is going on, whatever your political ideas are, it's irrelevant. - It doesn't matter. - Come on. - She needs a doctor. - You really don't get it. Look, the government will take her baby and parade a posh black English lady as the mother. - And she'll never see it again. - Nobody's taking my baby! We all know this government would never acknowledge the first human birth in 18 years from a fugee. A wanted fugee. Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron what they do to immigrants in this country? He knows. He's seen the cages. He's not that stupid. I'm not going to the government. You told me you would get me to the Human Project. - You promised me. - I know. And we will. But I don't think it's safe to try and reach the coast now. You could stay here, Kee. It's a safe place for you to have your child. And when you and the baby are well enough, we will find a way to get you to the Human Project. I promise you, Kee. It could take months to get back in touch with them again. This is true. We have to take it under consideration. Kee, this is your decision. What do you think? - I think you need proper care. - Oh, brilliant! She has proper care! - What the fuck does he know? - Hang on. Kee? Kee, this is your choice. - I have my baby here. - Yes! .then you get me to the Human Project. Thank you, Kee. Thank you. We need to organize safe houses. No more than three days in one place. No, no, you can't keep moving her around. It's for her safety. - Please help him! - What are you doing? - He's hurt really badly! - Oh, shit, fuck. - I didn't have anywhere else to go. - You're not supposed to be here! There's fucking police everywhere! - What do you think you're doing? - He's been bleeding for hours! Shut up! Get his bike out of here. Get it out! What was I supposed to do? It's a simple fucking plan. Get in here, Patric! What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? No fucking excuses! - You have a first aid kit? Medicine? - Mostly for cows. Iodine, bandages, clean towels, whatever you have, bring it to the barn. And for God's sake, hide the fucking motorcycle. - You put everything at risk. - What was I supposed to do? What about all the fucking police, Ian? You said it would be safe! We paid the gang. We had no idea about the cops. You broke the protocol. What were you thinking? What was I thinking? You could be responsible for putting the Uprising in jeopardy. He needs a proper doctor! Don't you get it? We have a baby. When people see we have a baby, everyone will join us in the Uprising. But we can forget about the baby if the girl even suspects we killed Julian! What was I supposed to do? You saw how he is. He's on death's fucking door! - Take it easy. - You broke protocol. He's my fucking cousin! Luke, he needs a doctor. Don't worry. We'll take care of him. Simon, right? - Aye, Simon. - All right, sit down, Patric. Simon is a good Fish. So are you. Be proud to know that because of the two of you, the Uprising is assured. The baby will stay with us. Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man. No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then, after we move the girl. Patric, you ever break protocol again, I'll have to kill you. Kee. Kee, it's Theo. - Listen to me. - What's going on? Luke killed Julian. They want your baby. They killed Julian. They're gonna. They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me. We have to leave. We have to go now. Miriam, shut up! Trust me, we've got to go. Stop it! Stop it! Both of you! Get off! I'm going with him. Miriam, you can stay if you want. Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut. - I mean it. - All right. All right. We're moving the girl to Bristol straight away. We need to bring weapons over. The refugee camps. Zaphyr, he looks bloody fucking awful. Yeah. Really? All that dirt and sand in there, nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin. Shit! It's fucking disgusting. He's not gonna make it. Of course not gonna make it, with all the blood and guts coming out. Hey, Samir. Shit. Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! The girl's in the car! - Stop! - The girl's in the car! Stop the fucking car! Give me the fucking keys. Give me the fucking keys. Get down! Get down! Can't you get it moving any faster? For God's sake! Come on. Come on. Stop! Stop! Shit. They're coming! They're coming! Get going, get going! They're getting closer! Oh, God! He's gaining on us! Can I shoot? I got a clean shot! Fuck off! Miriam, jump-start the car! We have to go! Wait till it gets faster! All right! All right! Just push, you push! Fucking hell! Miriam! Miriam! We have to wait for him! Theo! Go, go, go! - Kee, are you all right? - I'm fine. We need to find a safe house. Yeah, the last one was really fucking safe. Well, what do you suggest? Don't worry. I know where to go. Wait here. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Jasper? Janice? Jasper? - Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck you. What are you doing with this shit? This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats. It's not bullshit what they say. They pass away quite peacefully. Jasper. Meet Miriam and Kee. The Tomorrow is a hospital ship disguised as a fishing boat. They'll take us to the Human Project. I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real. Yeah, but you're also the guy that believes in UFOs. Tell them about that thing you saw on the heath. You saw a UFO? Did you know that the Human Project is supposed to have a community on the Azores? It's a sanctuary. That's where they'll take us, Kee. Can you catch this ship anywhere else? It's going to stop at the last two weather buoys en route at sunset. So it will be tonight at Windsmore and then two night's time at Bexhill. You can forget about Windsmore. We'd never make it in time. No, it's our only chance. We can't get to Bexhill. That's a refugee camp. Eureka! Eat and rest. With a little bit of luck, you're going to need all your energy. - Where are you going? - Feed her for me, Theo. Kee, your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for. Come on. Come on. Did he really see a UFO? Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo? She's doing something. She smited me with that. Said it was good for my baby. Does she look posh to you, or gawky? Earnest. Yeah. - How many months? - Eight. It takes nine months. I know. Who's the father? Whiffet. I'm a virgin. Sorry? That'd be wicked, eh? Yeah, it would. Fuck knows. I don't know most of the wankers' names. You know, when I started puking, I thought I catch the pest. But then my belly started getting big. Nobody ever told me these things. I never seen a pregnant woman before. But I knew. I felt like a freak. I didn't tell nobody. I thought about the Quietus thing. Supposed to be suave. Pretty music and all that. Then the baby kicked. I feel it. Little bastard was alive. And I feel it. And me, too. I am alive. - Froley. - Froley. Name my baby Froley. It's the first baby in 18 years. - You can't call it Froley. - Says who? Kee, I've found you a boat. - Great. - How? We get ourselves arrested. - Oh, Jesus. - No, no. Syd, this border guard I sell pot to, has agreed to get us into Bexhill. Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison! Wicked. "Froley." Come on. Everything is a mythical cosmic battle between faith and chance. - Maybe I shouldn't. - You already did. Take another one. Now cough. - What do you taste? - Strawberries. Strawberries? That's what it's called. Strawberry Cough. Wicked. So, you've got faith over here, right, and chance over there. - Like yin and yang. - Sort of. Or Shiva and Shakti. Lennon and McCartney. Look, Julian and Theo. Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met among a million protestors in a rally by chance. But they were there because of what they believed in in the first place, their faith. They wanted to change the world. And their faith kept them together. But by chance, Dylan was born. This is him? Yeah, that's him. He would have been about your age. Magical child. Beautiful. - Their faith put in praxis. - Praxis? - What happened? - Chance. He was their sweet little dream. He had little hands, little legs, little feet. Little lungs. And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic. And then, by chance, - he was gone. - Oh, Jesus. You see, Theo's faith lost out to chance. So, why bother if life's going to make its own choices? - Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes. - Yeah. Oh, boy. That's terrible. But, you know, everything happens for a reason. That I don't know. But Theo and Julian would always bring Dylan. He loved it here. It's the alarm! Someone's breaking in! What is it? Look at this. Shit. Jasper, hurry up! Where's Janice? Take the back path to the main road, then follow the map I've given Miriam. - Yeah, I've got it. - What are you talking about? Wait for Syd at the old school on Watchbell Road in Rye. Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig. - We need to get Janice. - We're not going, Theo. - What are you talking about? - You don't need an anchor. - No, Jasper. You're coming. - You need time. We'll stall them. I'll send them the wrong way. It's the best idea. Go on. Go on. Jasper. Theo, I've talked my way out of worse things than this. Believe me. Go on. Go. And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig. I love you. Hey, amigos! We're looking for Theo Faron. We know he was here a few weeks ago. Has he been back? - Who? - Theo Faron. I haven't seen him in weeks. There's biscuits and coffee on inside! Help yourself. You want a drag? Come on, have a drag. Lighten up. - What we got? - Here, Luke. There's a dead woman and dog inside. They're going to Bexhill. When did they leave? When did they leave? Pull my finger, go on. Pull my finger. I'll do it. Fuck you. Pull my finger. - Theo, I'm so sorry. - Don't you fucking touch me. You tell me the fucking reason in that. - It's all part of a bigger thing. - Shut up! Shut up and get in the fucking car. - Jasper? - He's fine. Everything's fine. I was 31. Midwife at the John Radcliffe. I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic. Three of my patients miscarried in one week. Others were in their fifth and sixth month. We managed to save two of the poor babies. Next week, five more miscarried. Then the miscarriages started happening earlier. I remember booking a woman in for her next appointment and noticing that the page seven months ahead was completely blank. Not a single name. I rang a friend who was working at Queen Charlotte's, and she had no new pregnancies, either. She then rang her sister in Sydney. And it was the same thing there. You can relax. She's finished. As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in. Very odd what happens in a world without children's voices. I was there at the end. Now you're gonna be there at the beginning. Yeah. I'll be there at the beginning. Thank you. Kee, come on! We've got to go! Stop where you are. I'm looking for Syd. Hands above your head. You're a fascist pig. What did you say? I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig. - Say it again. - No, don't, please! Say it again. Say it! You're a fascist pig. Come on. It was Jasper's idea, you know. The whole password thing. He will piss himself laughing when I tell him about this. He's a cheeky old bastard. So proud of his weed. Syd could get it a lot cheaper from the gangs, but Syd likes to deal with Jasper. Jasper's straight. A true gentleman. - All right. - What's wrong with her? Is she sick? Just carsick. - She's not going to puke, is she? - No. She's fine. Puking's bad. Very, very bad. It doesn't wash out. The smell never goes away. Usually, there's people trying to get out of Bexhill, not in. Syd doesn't know why you want to get in. Syd doesn't want to know. Syd doesn't care. Just breathe. Just breathe. What's wrong with her? A minor contraction. It's normal. Just breathe. All right. When you're released, stroll out with the other fugees. Look for the statue of a soldier. There you'll meet a woman, Marichka. Arab, gypsy, something. Always carries a shitty little dog with her. She'll find you accommodation for tonight. All right. You're fugees now. Show Syd the fugee face. Sad face. Sad fugee face. That's good. That's good. Okay. Out! Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up, move. Send me a postcard. Seats in the back! Come on, hurry up! What time are we supposed to meet the boat? Sunset tomorrow. How do we know that Luke and his mob haven't intercepted it? Luke has no way of contacting the Human Project. Nor does anyone else. Say again? Contact with the Human Project is done by mirrors. Julian was our mirror. What do you mean, "mirrors"? Mirrors. They contact one of our people. That person contacts someone else, and so on, till word gets to Julian. She tells Luke. You mean you never actually talked to any of them? Don't fucking tell me you never actually talked to them? - Breathe it out. - Is she okay? That's it. Breathe it out, breathe it out. I can't fucking breathe. You sure this is normal? It shouldn't be this frequent. Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right. Miriam, I'm all wet. Her water's broke. The baby's coming. Shit. Shit! All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart. Everything is fine. Breathe. Just breathe it out. That's it. Tomorrow you'll be safe. You'll be on the boat. On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you. They'll take you far away from all this. Look up, you piece of shite. Look up. Out! Get out! Lord, give Kee the strength to know that she has the power already within her. - She has the wisdom. - What's wrong with you? I said, what's wrong with you? Look at me! I said, what's wrong with you? - Saint Gabriel, help us. - Shut up! - You! Out! - Saint Gabriel, come to our aid! Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out! - Up, now. Come on. - Caca! Caca! Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl. You smell it yourself. You fucking people disgust me. She's okay, Kee. She's okay. - She's gonna be. - Miriam! Move it! Come along now! Come on, shift it! Shift it! You! Get down there. Down there. Move. Follow the line! - Theo! - Kee! - Take it off! - Theo! Come on, move! Move it! Come on! Move it! Move it! Come on! Move! Move! Britain supports you and provides you shelter. Do not support terrorists. Britain supports you and provides you shelter. Do not support terrorists. Hey you, buddy! Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise! You want accommodations? I got running water! I got. Just leave the girl alone. - Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do? - Fuck off. - Who do you fucking think you are? - Fuck off. Don't mind these bastards. I'll take care of you. Come on, I've got a room, food, a place to stay. What do you need? - I'm fine, thanks. - You must need something, man. "Fuck off," is it? Bollocks. Marichka? It's okay, Kee. Just breathe through it. That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee. We're almost there. It's just a few stairs. Just hold onto me. I've got you. Just keep breathing. Marichka? How far? How far? We're almost there, Kee. Almost there. You're doing great. Come on. You're almost there. Three more steps. We're there, Kee. We're there. Okay, there's a bed. Easy. Make her go! Make her go! That's great. Thank you. Get her out! Get her out! Thank you. Okay, Kee. I'm going to put my coat underneath. You'll be cleaner. You're okay. Okay? There's water. I'm just going to wash my hands. - Theo! Theo! - I'm here. Fuck! It's okay. Everything's okay. Do something! It's looking good, Kee. It's looking good. You're doing great. Just keep breathing. - Keep breathing. - I am breathing! No, like Miriam said. Do you remember? Breathe out. Just think about the out. Breathe out and push. Push as well. - That's it. That's it! - I can't! Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Just out and push. Out and push. - That's it! - I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please. Kee, I can see the head. I can see the head. You're doing great. You're doing great, Kee. That's it. That's it. It's coming again. Just breathe out and push. Out and push. - That's it. Out and. - I can't. - You can. Yes, you can. - I fucking can't! - Yes, you fucking can! Come on! - I can't do it. Kee, the head's coming out. That's it, you're nearly there! You're nearly there. Just push! Push, Kee! Push! Push! Oh, my God. How is he? It's a girl. Kee, you've got a girl. Hey, baba. - Aren't we supposed to cut the cord? - Yeah, it's okay. There's no rush. You've done it. Kee, see? It wasn't that bad. Oh, yeah, not for you. Come on! Hurry up! We don't have much time! Who is it? The King of England. Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd. How can you sleep through when the whole city's going to hell? - What's wrong with her? - She's fine. It's a woman's thing. Fuck off! A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole in the fence and fugees got out. But Syd happens to know, the hole in the fence isn't about fugees getting out. - It's about Fishies getting in. - Go away. Syd also happens to know that the Army's gonna blow the shit out of this place. But don't worry. Syd is here to get you out. Fuck off. Go away. Go on. Piss off! Get your fucking dog. What you got there? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. - No? - Like to show me? - I don't have anything. - It's nothing. - Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look. - It's nothing. - Let me see. - No. - Let me see. It's okay. Let me see. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. - That's a. - That's right. We got a baby. And now we need a rowboat. Can you help us? Get her up. Get her up. We need to go. Can you help us get a boat? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up. We need to go. We need to go now. - What's she saying? - Fuck knows. Bad! Bad! Bad! - She doesn't want us to go. - Shut up. We need to go. Syd was watching television last night with Mommy. She's a sweet old soul. Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking. And then the news came on, and you two were on it. Something about a cop killer. Something about a big reward. Syd then finds out the Fishes are looking for you. So Syd thinks, "If the Fishes are looking for you, "and the coppers are looking for you, "you people are first class commodities." Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Down, down, down! Now, Syd has a baby. Bad! Bad! Bad! Marichka! I'll fucking kill you, you bitch! I'll fucking kill you! Bitch. You bitch. Baby! Marichka baby! Quick, quick. The baby! My baby! She took. I'll fucking kill you, you gypsy bitch! I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out. Go, go! Fuck! Shit. How are you doing? - How are you? - It hurts. Marichka, we need a boat. A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat. We need a boat. A fucking boat! A boat. - A rowboat! - Yes. Hurry. - You okay? Come on. - Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. It's okay. Look at that, Theo. They love my baby. I want to call her Bazouka. Bazouka? You don't like it? I was getting used to Froley. Froley's a man's name. What is he thinking, giving you a boy's name? You're a girl. We have a boat. Stay here. In one hour, we go. Thanks. Human Project real? It better be. Drop your gun! Drop your gun! Put your hands up! Put your fucking hands in the air! Okay, is clear! Is clear! Hands above your head and fucking move that here. You killed my fucking cousin! Get on your knees! On your knees, you fucking. He was 19! Don't kill him! Don't kill him! Watch the flanks! Kee. Thank God. You'll be safe now. How's the child? You put their lives at risk. Just let her go. You don't know what you're doing. No? Look around you. It's the Uprising. And they haven't even seen the baby. Let's go. No! Get off. Not in front of the girl. Wait till we get around the corner. Then do them all. Come on! Oh, lads You should have seen us gannin' Passing the folks along the road And all of them was starin' And all the lads and lasses there They all had smilin' faces Fuck! Sorry. Sorry. Move it! Get her inside! Faron! Get her inside! Get her in the building now! Now! Move it! Now! Sarge, left flank! Slug the fuckers! Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens! Go check the roof! I was carrying the baby up the stairs. I started crying. I'd forgotten what they looked like. They're so beautiful. They're so tiny. Julian was wrong! She thought it could be peaceful! But how can it be peaceful when they try to take away your dignity? We need him, Theo! We need the baby. We need him! It's a girl, Luke. A girl? I had a sister. Theo! Theo! You okay? How is she? Annoyed. My God, the baby. Move back! Fucking move back! Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing! - Cease firing! - Cease firing! - Cease firing! - Cease firing! We've got two coming through, coming out.

What a day. We're too late, aren't we? No. No, we're fine. But they said they wouldn't wait. Trust me. They'll come back. I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding! - No, no, no, it's me. - I'm bleeding everywhere. - It's me. - What? He got me. Bad? No. I'm fine. Keep her close, Kee. Whatever happens, whatever they say, you keep her close. It's going to be okay. She's probably got wind. Wind her. Put her on your shoulder. Just. Just tap her back. Gently. Gently. There you go. Oh, Jesus. Dylan. I'll call my baby Dylan. It's a girl's name, too. Theo? Theo? Theo! Theo, the boat. The boat! It's okay. We are safe now. We're safe. <i>No!</i> <i>Mum!</i> <i>Please stop.</i> <i>No, please! Just leave us alone!</i> - Mum! - Please don't. <i>Don't do it!</i> <i>Mum.</i> <i>Mum!</i> Hey, you okay? Okay? Please help me, they killed my mum. What? Who? Red masks. The men in red masks. Have you been kidnapped, too? Yeah, I think so. Please. Please untie me. Okay, okay What happened? They shot her. The men in red masks, they came to our house and shot her. Hey, hey. I'm sorry. Listen. What's your name? Alex. Okay, Alex. You're being very brave. I need you to be brave for a little bit longer, okay? I'm gonna go and get some help. Listen, you need to wait for it to stop moving, okay? Okay. Go. My leg. My leg! What's your name? It's Ryan. Ryan. How come you were in the van? I have no idea. The last thing I remember is at Hibiscus. Reading a chemistry text book Dr. Langham gave me. And I wasn't in London. Why would someone kidnap you? I don't know. I just want my mum back. Look, I'm gonna go to the police, okay? What did you say about his biscuits? Hibiscus. What's that? A rehab facility. It's kind of like a hospital. I've been there for a few years, was your mum there? Are you sick? It's called post-traumatic stress disorder. I get dizzy spells. Panic attacks and nightmares. Although this seems very real. Except, I don't have my ring. And I've never seen this before. June. My watch says June the seventh. That's today. Are you sure? But when I went to sleep it was January. Hey! Where are you? Hello? Where are you? No! It was you! It was you! You! You did it! You did it! You killed my mum! Help! Alex! Ten days. Hello! Hibiscus Trauma Unit US, call. Hello, Hibiscus? What do you mean, "Wrong number"? How can they have been closed for years? What year is this? This year now, right now, what year is this? I heard you shout, you okay? Everything all right? Yeah. I knocked the table, I was annoyed. I bet you were. It's a 200-year-old single malt you love telling me about. Shall we go over it, so we're all clear? Everything's in place. The tests from Leonid show that it works on a long-term trial, as you know. So we're still on schedule. The medic from the interrogation center had his little accident. So your alias is Cedric Saunders, and it stood up with their background checks. You start in five weeks, the mercenaries are on standby. And finally the electron micrograph came from Kiev, so the lab's fully equipped and ready for our scientists. Imagine all those individuals locked in their own heads and they're thinking of who or what they hurt. Imagine we get those drones online. What about the boy? He's fine. The driver's gone. I handled it. We can't have any more incidents like we did at the graveyard. You sure you're okay? Have a drink. You want to see the feed? <i>Welcome, Harkin. What can I do for you today?</i> <i>Hibiscus Project online.</i> What are you doing to him? It happened again, didn't it? Your name is Ryan Reeve. Isn't it? You're good, but I'm still better. I started at a very young age. My father always taught me, "A man can't use his mind, until he knows how to use his body." Good lesson. Worth all the scars. You probably won't come back. But if you do, stop, wait it out, don't talk to anyone, don't operate machinery, if you're driving, pull over. You won't have time to achieve anything anyway. The reboot only takes nine minutes and 47 seconds. But still, why don't we make this a short one? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. What am I doing here? If you don't know that, maybe I'm not the person with the most problems in the room. You told me to play dead. Why? I guess because you like it. You paid Sergio a lot of money and I don't ask questions. Three weeks? Did I mention a kid, a boy called Alex? What's your name? I've told you already. Tell me again. Dana. You've been shouting it enough. "I'm gonna make you beg, Dana." That sort of thing. I'm sorry, Dana. The person who I was just then, that's not who I am now. A crazy thing is happening to me. I wake up in these situations and I don't know how I got there. But the guy that was doing that to you is not me. So, who are you? Who was he? I don't know. Mmm. Right. You still got an hour, mystery man, so are we gonna play this game or the first one? I need to find Dr. Langham. I don't want to wear these, do you have anything else? Only things clients have left behind, in the trunk. When I came in, was there another man with me? Bright blue eyes. I don't know. Nine minutes, 47 seconds. Okay, get dressed. Why? We're leaving. No, no, no. I'm never allowed to leave. Sergio owns me. I'm gonna handle Sergio. And you're gonna do what I tell you, do you understand me? My, my. We haven't changed much at all, have we? Hurry up What is this music? Sergio's favorite. He plays it throughout the house to remind girls and clients who is in charge. Well, like I said, I'm gonna deal with Sergio. No, I expect he'll be dealing with you. Why do you do this? Why do any of us do anything? Yeah, but you don't like it, you're not feeding a habit, so why are you here? Life has brought me here. So if you weren't here, what would you be doing? Go back to my hometown. Finish nursing school. What's your town like? This is pointless. What's your town like? Quiet. Under a mountain. Nice houses with brightly painted window frames and white picket fences. I miss it. So like I said, why are you here? My son was sick. His care was very expensive, I had to borrow a lot of money, quickly. I didn't know where to go. So I came here. When you owe somebody that much, they own you. So how is your boy now? His name is Eden. He died. I'm sorry. No you're not. Thank you for your custom. <i>House rules state that only one</i> <i>customer may leave at any time.</i> <i>This door will now lock for two minutes.</i> <i>View our selection of girls in front of you.</i> <i>Book your favorite by scheduling an outcaH</i> <i>and have all your dreams come true.</i> You're Sergio? He doesn't speak much English. Hey. One of you tell Sergio I'm taking this girl out. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) He says you, "Just because you pick the girl from line "does not mean you leave with her. "She belong to me." That wasn't me. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) You look same, who it was. Who are you? I'm not entirely sure. But you're welcome to try and find out. Come on now! Hey! I think we can help each other. Please, please don't scream. Here, take this. That's enough for you to get away from Sergio. I just need you to do me a favor. I need you to go to the police, and I need you to tell them about me. I kidnapped a child called Alex, and I shot his mother. If you want to be arrested, why not just go turn yourself in? 'Cause I only get 10 minutes, and when I change I won't want to. Change into what? Do this for me and you get your freedom back. You have no idea. Sergio will come for me and he will not stop until he's found me. Look, you've lost a kid, we can help this one. Please. Please. You didn't tell me we were in New York. Where did you think you were?

One terrorist, two terrorist, three terrorist, four terrorist, five terrorist, six terrorist, seven terrorist, eight terrorist, nine terrorist, 10 terrorist. Up. Where's the research, 43543? We're not gonna stop till we've got what we need. You talk, and we all go get a slice of pie and enjoy the sunshine. What do you say, Mr. Scientist? Fuck you. You want some more? Let's go again, right now! Wait. We've gotta give him, what? Five, 10 minutes? Right, Doc? Doc. We can't break him with one hand tied behind our backs like this. You don't know how it is with Leonid. Leonid. Two years we've been processing him, not a peep. Now, the old doctor, he was real big on prisoner's rights. How about the rights of ordinary, decent people to sleep peacefully in their beds at night without worrying about a sick fuck like him? How about letting us bend the rules a little? Where are we? Are you fucking with me? You don't know where we are? Is there a problem? Come on, Doc. What the fuck? You know where we are is classified, and if you don't, I can't tell you. Okay. He's having some kind of episode. We should just do what we've got to do. He's not going to tell anyone. There was a boy. Achild. And there was a girl, Dana, a prostitute. She was helping me, and then Sergio. What are you talking about? Just do your fucking job! I keep blacking out and. I kidnapped a kid. I don't know where he is now, because I'm me. I mean, lam the "me" I am now. But soon I will change and I'll know, but I won't want to tell you. Now, I know how this sounds. I know this sounds crazy, but please, you have to believe me. There's a child's life at stake. He's got something strapped to him. Doc, come on! I will shoot you! Give it up, Doc! Down! Down! Get the fuck down! The mask, give it to me! You're the scientist? Of course, yes. Is there a technology that allows people to control somebody else's mind? This is hardly the time. Tell me about mind control! I have heard of such a program. Experimental death, called droning. How is it done? How is it done? The host body holds a receiver, like a modem receiving a signal. Where? All neurological impulses go through the basal ganglia in the back of the neck, so probably there. Now, the mask, please. Now how are we going to get out of here? Hey! Hey! Are you the contact? What happens now? Where is the laboratory? Where are Dr. Langham's people? It's his plan! What now? I see they've redesigned the chronometer. The new spectrograph 406. They must've brought it out while I was indisposed. A wide-spectrum deprillator. Already configured. And after months of waiting and fragmented communication, you break me out of my cell and give me a nice new laboratory. Thank you so very much. Gentlemen, let's celebrate. Hey, the studio's benefactor number two, have a glass. To a fruitful collaboration. <i>Nostrovia!</i> Now that I see you are men of your word, let me show you something. All my work, right here. Ingenious. Kept all your work right under their noses for years. This stuff is far too good for governments to know. You know why lam the best? Hmm? Because I can see the aesthetics. My contemporaries are vulgarians. They see only RNA bases, enzymes. I see Picasso. Biology's purest sculpture. The virus. I'll make something simple and nasty. An airborne pathogen that messes with DNA in a particularly baroque fashion. Makes the subject grow some extra eyes, say. I'll make it very contagious. We show them it works. We threaten to release it over some densely populated cities. And we all grow obscenely rich. Yeah, about that. That's all very interesting, very "baroque" was it you said? Mmm. Well, actually, Leonid, we may have mislead you, somewhat. I mean, do we need your expertise? Yes. Do we need you to build this bespoke virus? Yes. But are we going to blackmail governments for money? No. No, we're not. We're not interested in blackmail here, and we don't need money. You may not understand this, but our ambitions are a little wider. I will not work if I do not agree to the cause. I'm very well aware of that. Let me show you something. <i>No, no, no, no'.!</i> Stop! You'll die. Back away. What are you doing? Lucky it's not too deep. All right, I'm gonna stay here until this one's over. A change of plans, I think. What nonsense this is, I do not know. But it proves one thing. You have ceased to be of use. So thank you very much for my freedom, and an excellent place to work. But I will go from here alone. It's DNA coded. You need an override code. So why don't you relax and watch some TV. What is this? <i>Hello, Leonid.</i> <i>The boy, of course, is Alex. I believe you know him.</i> What have you done to my son? Please don't.</i> <i>No! Mum!</i> <i>Mum, no.</i> <i>I killed the mother,</i> <i>but your son is still alive.</i> <i>Although, perhaps not for long, my dear boy.</i> <i>The acid between the sheets is irreversibly</i> <i>spreading towards your son's body</i> <i>and can only be stopped by us.</i> <i>Ifs a little much, I admit.</i> <i>But it's a visual incentive and I do have a penchant for theatrics.</i> <i>I give you my word, your son will be released if you do what we say.</i> <i>All your instructions are in front of you.</i> Leonid. We can save Alex. But we need to act fast before I change back into him. I'm gonna black out soon and there isn't much time left. Leonid. <i>Two, one. Manual shutdown.</i> We are no longer transmitting, which means. Hello, Ryan. Let's see. Pulse normal. Within tolerance. The ports are clear. There's nothing wrong with the old receiver tech. It's embedded nicely. The vocal chords have been disabled, and I've fixed the self-inflicted damage on the right side of the neck and opened the node portal on the left. I've gone over all the transmission equipment. It's working perfectly. So, it has to be a fault or interference with the satellite. Quite frankly, there's nothing we can do about that, 'cause it might just happen more, and possibly more randomly. Every now and again, soldier boy is gonna get his head back until the reboot kicks in automatically. Which, as we have seen, is plenty of time for him to make quite a mess of things. He's incredibly persistent. All I have to do is just slit this vein. I know that I can take care of everything on my own from here. We'll discuss this when you get back. Bug repair the subject. I'd keep still if I were you, Ryan. Good night, Ryan. I really hope we don't meet again. Alex. Another transmission failure, huh? Hello, Ryan. It's a crude solution, I admit, laughably simple. My idea. Your entrance, we noted, was marked by a moment of involuntary spasm. So we're using that. You wake up, you drop the ball, it inflates, you go down for a little sleep. Soon as you're back, you're gone again. There's a grand plan, Ryan. Why are you fighting it? Why do you even care? Honestly, this really has nothing to do with you. We upped the dose a little bit, so it'll be straight back down. That's it, let the drugs do theirthing. Don't fight it. Don't panic everyone, he's okay. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) Sergio.

Leonid works like a man possessed. Everything is fine. It's all this waiting around that's annoying. Nothing to do but wait. It makes me edgy. That van makes me edgy. I'm gonna go check it. I said stay! There's something I wish to talk to you about. What is it? I'm having trouble remembering a few things. Could be all the port switching causing neural decay. You're also getting knockout doses of heavy drugs. It's not healthy. No, well. Nothing we can do about that. What else are you having trouble remembering? The override code for the weapons? In case Leonid. Override 4754. Your birthday? 4th month 2nd day. One day too late, you always said. Yes. Yes. The name of our dog? Alpha. This is serious. We should get you a scan. Yes, but one more thing. I'm having trouble remembering where. Where we placed the boy. I'm sure it's temporary, but I. Yeah. I'm sure it will come back. Even so. I'd like to write it down. <i>Image sized.</i> Since when are you right handed? You learned to catch the ball didn't you? Shutting down. Hey! Hey! I need you to help me. Sir, we need you to calm down, all right? Step back, sir! I kidnapped a boy. Scan. <i>Scanning in progress.</i> Unarmed. Listen to me. Do not put your hands on us!

It's all there. Trust me. Why don't you relax, huh? I've come a long way. Why don't you shut your fucking mouth and finish counting? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) He would like me to remind you that this wouldn't have happened if your friend hadn't tried to steal his property. By which he means me. Okay. Come on. Okay? I wonder, after receiving all that you just did, if you wouldn't mind letting my friend take the girl. We'll dispose of her when we're done. <i>Niet. Get out.</i> Come on, let's go. We should move very quickly, Father. I've arranged a little surprise for them. She really does resemble Mom. I know why you like that girl. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Go! Don't be stupid, Ryan.

I don't know where you've been. Look, he pushed me out of the van. He forced me to do that, and then he pulled me back in again. He only took me with him that last time as bait. I'm sorry. I don't know where that is. Okay, when I change you follow me, you watch me, you bring the police. I can't do that. Then you need to get as far away from me as possible.

One terrorist, two terrorist, three terrorist, four terrorist, five terrorist, six terrorist, seven terrorist, eight terrorist, nine terrorist, 10 terrorist. Fuck it, eleven terrorist. Won't ask you again. Where's Leonid? In a secret lab. Making avirus. Finally. Where? I want to tell you, but I'm being controlled by Dr. Francis Langham. I've have, like, a modem inside me. Sometimes the signal goes down, and I'm myself again. It's called droning. Now, we have procedures we have to follow, as you know. Always have a medic present during waterings, wait five minutes between bouts, all that shit. The thing is, this flight. It doesn't exist. So the rule book goes out of the fucking window. Wait! Let's say I give the benefit of the doubt. I'm gonna try and reason with you. Look at this shit. And this, and this. Leonid, the guy you're covering for, has worked out how to do something that no one else can. There are guys who know how to genetically code and engineer a virus. We've been doing it ever since we grew an ear on a mouse decades ago, but Leonid's are something special. His viruses fuck with your DNA. This one was his first success. Made you grow extra lungs. Only they wouldn't stop growing. To stop it going global we had to scorch the earth for 100 miles around his lab. Now, Leonid out, cooking up viruses in a lab? That's a very bad idea. So, where the fuck is this dangerous asshole? I don't know. I'm being controlled. You need to speak to Dr. Francis Langham. LSR Bioware? Yes. Him and his son, they made me kidnap a kid. He and his son killed themselves when their company went down. They faked it. He's controlling me. Bullshit. This is your last chance. I'm old school, my dad was old school. Served 50 years. I like old school things. Cars, records, Sun; No codes, just odds. Right now it's one in six. Where's the lab? I don't know. Oh, God! I'd advise you to start talking. Who's in charge of the operation? Who are you? I don't know! Please. Four. It's exciting, isn't it? You sure you don't want to tell us where the lab is? I'm sorry. Please! I just wanna save the kid. What's the plan? What virus is Leonid making? I don't know. It's the organ! It's the organ he's controlling me with. It's bioware. He's made it smaller. Nano, pico, Leonid's virus will carry it. Everyone infected will grow a place the tech can sit. This thing that they've done to me, they're gonna do it to everyone! He wants to control everyone! I'm just gonna shoot him! Please! Please! You have to believe me, please. Please. He's either crazy or he's telling the truth. Yeah, I say crazy. I've seen worse though. Korea. There's this guy who thought he was the devil. Another guy thought he was God. Just to see what would happen, we put 'em in a cell together. Straight off, they started whaling on each other. Real dirty. Who won? It was even. But the devil had the better moves. Hey. Hey, is that plane following us? Shit, it's firing something. Is that you, Ryan? Back again? Hmm? What do you think about this arrangement? No more dealing with inflatable balls and knockout drugs. All the tech in the world and the best thing is to simply tie you up. It's me, son. Really. Yes. I'm trying to imagine what it will be like to control anyone I choose. The prospect makes me quite giddy. Me, too. We'll be more efficient and powerful than any government in the world. A few necessary sacrifices, and people will not only want control, they'll demand it. Leonid wants to see his kid free. Delivery is in a few days. I would like to stretch my legs, son. This? I might as well be back in the chair. We can't let that happen. You should have been chained the moment the fugues started, Father. Ryan nearly destroyed the whole project. The solar flares are settling, and they will no longer be effecting the satellite's signal. One, maybe two episodes at most. So you gave the satellite a high orbit. I didn't know solar storms were going to interfere with the satellite. It's an 11-year cycle. This size? It's once every thousand years. How am I. You should've checked all eventualities. I did. I've sacrificed so much. I have worked so hard. You demanded obedience, and I obeyed and succeeded, despite this. You're right. Your behavior these last few months has impressed me. Thank you. I may not often say, but I am proud to be your father. Embrace me, son! Ryan. Clever, I admit. But what now? Save that kid? From out here, the middle of nowhere? In the amount of time that you have left? I don't see that happening, do you? Just enjoy the sun on your skin, breeze in your face. Bird singing. I have a suggestion. Let's have a drink. I'll show you a picture of your wife. You remember her, don't you? Come. Have a seat. I get it Ryan. I do. Did I ever tell you about my mom? She was 35. She was killed along with 26 other people by a solo crazed gunman who didn't wanna pay taxes anymore. Now, how is that fair? He did the wrong thing. I'm doing the right thing. Just like your wife. She's gone. Move on. Don't spend the few remaining fragments of your life suffering. Enjoy them. To living every moment as if it were your last. You're right. So now I know what I need to do. What's the point? You don't wanna do that. You'll kill us both. You followed me. Following, watching, everywhere just like you asked. I used the money you left me and the truth is, <i>no one's been as good to me as you.</i> Ever. There isn't anytime. So you might as well just let me die. Will you, Ryan, come back again? Maybe once or twice. That's enough to save the boy. We both have lost people that we care about. We shouldn't lose this kid. Put these on before you change. Why are you really helping me? What else do I have? Hey! Reply, Eden. Right answer, hero. How long? Three days. We're not far, but we haven't much time. The other guy's been looking. Ten minutes till you change back, right? Yeah. Here you go. All right. Let's roll. This is where it's all going down. Whatever it is. Hibiscus. I started a countdown. So you'll know. Okay, I need you to listen to me. You need to run now. 'Cause if you see me again, it won't be me. Do you understand? No. Yes. Yes. No! Listen, I'm trying to save your life. No. No. <i>Welcome, Dr. Langham.</i> <i>I've made your virus, integrated the biotechnology.</i> <i>Now let my son go, you bastards. Let him go!</i> <i>HI have to test it.</i> They killed Leonid. Drop the gun, Ryan. Dr. Langham. Yes! Drop the gun or the boy dies. We took this subject to test the new virus when we rescued you from the plane. Or me, I should say. Less than a day, the body assimilates imbedded picotech. Subject's online in two. New population-control satellite's been launched. You're looking at the first of the new breed. I thought I was the first. Third actually. An expendable prototype. All I have to do is walk out there, and within days, without them realizing it, people will be ready to be controlled. Ready to be given purpose, my dear boy. What do you plan to do with me? Nothing. Your satellite will be back online in a few moments. I may just push white noise through your signal, keep you around like my favorite old pair of slippers. You won't be coming back again, Ryan. Any last requests? A drink. I do have one more question. Why? You know how you control the masses? Fear. Humanity does appalling things. Some of them, I've experienced. We saw so many tragic cases come through the unit. It was sickening. War. War. War. Endless fighting and dying, and dying and fighting. But in the world that I create, if you break my laws, you will simply be switched off. Your signal overtaken. And that fear will create a beautiful future. A world without conflict. A world of harmony. Harmony. Exactly! So why do you wish to stop me? Because I want my life back and you don't have the right. Not only do I have the right. It's my duty. Your life. You have no life. I've been your life! I took you because you ended yours when you allowed your wife to die, because you couldn't make a choice. It's important what you read last thing at night. It sets the tone of your sleep. That was one of the many things you taught me. I learnt so much from you. So, so much. Things I'd never even heard of before. Like valencies, isomers and chemical reactions. Did you meet him? He's dead. Doesn't matter. How about this beautiful creature next? You're fond of her aren't you? My dad likes her, too. My mother had more class. But this isn't just for her. We need a new world and this is it. Your dad's plan won't work, Harkin. I agree. My father's an idealist, it doesn't mean he's wrong. You see, I put a little more thought into it. There are no good guys and bad guys, Ryan. Just opinions. But you know the right way to get one individual controlling everyone? By having me controlling the right individual. For example, let’s just say a particularly unstable world leader. Control's inevitable in some form, whether it's us or not. But this being airborne, people are gonna purge their systems. They're gonna mimic the tech, they're gonna destroy the satellites. I know that. But me having the right person, doing the right thing to ensure that this planet has a future. Now that makes sense, Ryan. That's how I'll remake the world. There's absolutely no reason to stop me. You don't give up, I infect her, we win. You shoot me, this falls, it goes airborne, we win. You do nothing, you time out, I win. This is not a situation that you can shoot yourself out of. I guess not. All this for a kid? You've caused me so many problems, Ryan. So, I'm gonna let you watch me inject her before you time out. Admittedly, it'll be a little different for my father. Let's just see if he likes being inside her once again. Something for him to toy around with before he ultimately realizes that he's not needed anymore. She doesn't deserve that. Oh, I know that. But we should always try and do what's right for our family, Ryan. You of all people should know that. Missed. Let's see how you like it! Hey, whore, say goodbye. Hey, Ryan. Come on. Come on up. You okay? Here. Here. His name's Alex. I want you to look after him as if he were your own. Thank you so much. No! You don't have to do this. If I don't do it, I'm gonna change back. Please! Please! I'm sorry. No! Time's up! You okay? I got you. Hang on. It's okay. Hang on a second. Ryan? Hey, it's me. It's okay now, it's over! Harkin and Langham? They're dead. Look, I couldn't risk anyone else tuning in, so I cut them out. Where are we? Home. Look. I tried explaining to him as best I could. It'll still probably take him a little time to get used to you. He's a good kid. I was thinking that maybe we could all hang until we figure things out. Mmm. Baby, that was no minor surgery. You need to rest. I have an idea. You take control. <i>.hang tight. We're live in five.</i> Ryan? Ryan? So, where is this renowned father? Will father show his face to you, sir? A shallow womanizer fashions himseIf a dashing wit. Perhaps he cannot hear your whimpering, sir. Pathetic palter. Very quick. Move. Some other dog beat us to the treasure. Hear that? No, pIease. Mercy. I will serve you. AbeIar, does it still exist? AbeIar? Ah, yes. RuIed by a queen, EIdoria. She has passed on. Her eIdest. . . eIdest chiId Ma'at is queen now. Really? I won't harm the queen, but I will make you do with her seed.

PIease, find safety. All of you Ieave at once. I will aIert the GeneraI, Your Highness. And we must find he who saved us before. The Mercenary? Your father. But, our father is dead. He died saving AbeIar from the Sorceress. Your father is not mine. I was sired by the king but. you. . . .you were by this mercenary. Mother said you were the king's chiId to protect you. You must Ieave the past behind. Our kingdom needs us now. Kingdom Bush is not my father? No, but he who is Iives. If we so be separated mother said this will Iead you to him. With this token, he will know you and you shall know him. And this will heIp you to understand the sorcery. My Queen. They are within the paIace, Your Majesty. You must come now. You have to go. No, come with us. My Queen, you both have a Iong time to struggIe. I've trained you well, Your Highness. You are ready for what comes. Stand. We can make sure of your safety if you follow this hall. It will Iead you out of the paIace. But what about you? My duty is to remain here, Kara. No. If you stay, then so will I. You can do nothing more here, Dernier. The RoyaIs will scheme to save their skins. We will be Ieft to fend for ourseIves and not aIways with the truth. They have no regard for us. But I am sworn to. . . You have sworn to Iove me, Dernier or was that just to weaken my will. I Iove you. Then save us my Iove. - I must kill the infected. - Leave her. She's a friend. It's your wish. There, it Ieads to a quay where our boat waits. - It will take you to Durris. - Durris? An outIaw city? If he still Iives the peopIe there will know his whereabouts. Tanis, l'm find remember what I said. If we so be separated, you must find him. We've run out of time. Run, Tanis. - But sister. - Hush. You're not a chiId but a Princess of AbeIar, a Ieader with responsibiIities. Act it. Find your father. Save our peopIe. They count on us, Tanis. - I can't do this aIone. - You must. Go. Now. I command you. Do not Iook back or rest. It's been what, 20 years? Where's your mother's Iover? What was his name again? It seems to have sIipped my mind. He has not sIipped mine. Why, of course. He sent your father to the Abyss. I must have thought of a million different ways to make you and your mother suffer, but nothing was ever terribIe enough. I mean, how do you repay someone who buried you aIive for 20 years? Nothing smelled Iike Iife, Your Highness. You must be wondering how is it she is back Iooking so wonderfully restored. CIearIy, we watched your destruction. CIearIy, you shouIdn't have given the finaI rights to a high priest with designs on your throat. A pity he perished with some mysterious pIague upon his return. Who knows what Iives in dust? And who are you? Go, go. - Where is my seat, Your Highness? - I'm not sure. Kill her. Get the girI. The paIace is Iost. - The Queen is dead? - Or worse. What are they? Vampires. But we will not die tonight. I couId fight harder. You Ieave the killing to me. What is to become of us now or the kingdom? My master is the son of a race. But, there is aIways a need for a pretty servant, and there is one against me as well. - What is it? - Hush, hush. Why the guards they are so daunting? They're trying to kill us. What? It is read. - It's my fauIt. - No. On your Iife run. I have aIways Ioved you. I will. And now, a Iadder across the Abyss that I might free my father. In my stead, you will awaken my seed. She is the true daughter of my race, and though haIf human, she will be human no more. Ah, Denier. - I'm sorry. - No, you're not. You used me. What? No, I Ioved you. Really? Yes, right, I was using you, Dernier. You are eviI. Becoming a vampire isn't even the worst of me. That and more. Are you going to kill me now? Bite my throat, drain me of my bIood? I want you. I couId soothe you, Dernier. You couId use someone Iike me for a sIave. I have too much over the past. I will bring victims to you to fuIfill whatever dark fantasies you have. I will do whatever I have to do for you? You are a monster. I will bow to you, Kara. Kara, bow to her. Life takes many forms in many worIds and she's in her finaI metamorphosis, her chrysaIis. Why me? You are speciaI. But you've aIways known that. SpeciaI in a way that no one eIse couId see untiI it was too Iate. And even as a chiId, you have aIways been cunning, intelligent, depraved. You have tried to bIend in or be a human, safe, but even as a chiId you knew you were different, filled with dark corruptness. Are you ready to be free? You're free now but not yet fully transformed. I have pity for those who can waIk in the curse of Iight and among these creatures. We have much more work to do before we can be safe. I sent the princess to the reefs. If she's dust, find her. Know what she's pIotting, and most importantIy with whom. Why me? Because she will know and trust you when she's most vuInerabIe. And if I refuse? You've hungered for this day when you couId be who you are and what you are to Iet those dark urges free. Mother said this will Iead you to him. With this token he will know you and you shall know him, and this will heIp you to understand the sorcery. You're not a chiId but a Princess of AbeIar, a Ieader with responsibiIities. Act it. Find your father. Save our peopIe. My princess. You shouIdn't have been wearing this? PIease. - You cheated Dog. - What? Go weep to the gods. You will die. I shall cIeave your thick ugIy faces. No dog cheats me and Iives. Thankfully, I'm not a dog but I do Iike to cheat. Now, I'm gonna have to kill you Iike a bitch pup. HoIy shit. I want this man. She wants me. I'll tell you what, wench, Iet me kill this dog and then I will bed you so hard. . . Somebody you want me. Wench, you've diminished my reputation. It couId be diminished, sir? Why bog me, did I do your mother, huh, or, uh, sister perhaps? The Iast of it, the Iate great AbeIar and how it came to be overcome. - Sir. - I mean no disrespect, Iady. I noticed your cIoak. It came from the paIace guard. So, it is. Like yourseIf, I bareIy escaped these fouI creatures. I'm here to spread the word of what these eyes have seen. - You've seen much. - Aye. In this one worId. That's why you're here. You've seen far too much sir. Brother and sister? Different mothers but a common father. And you say we were meant to find our father? ExactIy. And together we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia and return AbeIar to the peopIe. Uh-huh. So, Princess, you speak for the RoyaI House? That is correct. How much am I to be paid to save your precious AbeIar? Paid? I didn't mention anything about a bounty. We do this because it's right - and just and it's what we shouId. . . - This sword will not be drawn untiI it received proper compensation. You disappoint again. Oh, my Iady, one night in bed with me and. . . I'm your sister. HaIf. How couId I expect any nobiIity from a pig Iike you. Wait. Look, your taiI hoIds a certain fancy, but I am in need of coin and I'm willing to take your word that there will be a bounty. What do you know about him? Well, not much. Nothing at all. Nor a trickster? Aye, but this trickster knows where our sister may be, and to her our dear father. A sister? Where? About that bounty? If your word proves true, then you shall have it. I gave you my word. That shouId be sufficient. I am called Aedan. And what are you doing here? What? Can't a brother heIp his sister? After five years? No. This comes with some terribIe price. You're not a woman with many an option. There's a fouI tempered undertaker and eventuaI traitor wanting to see you skinned at dawn. And what is this act of brotherIy Iove going to cost me? It's more priviIege than the price. We get to save AbeIar. I don't think I'm dressed appropriateIy. PIus, of course, there is a bounty. And where wouId you get reaI bounty? From AbeIar. She's your sister. But maybe a IittIe more. Well, what is your name. You wouId Iike to sit down and have a drink with me, huh? Tell us the taIe, sister. A fortnight ago the Sorceress Xia captured AbeIar. My sister, the Queen, was murdered. Xia? Didn't father put that DeviI wench down or is that another tall taIe? Well, cIearIy he didn't put her permanentIy down, thus creating an opportunity. She's back and she's taking AbeIar with sorcery. Which is to say she's infested AbeIar. Don't you have any conversation for me? You are so beautifuI. It's all Greek to me. She will continue to feed, to spread her darkness untiI the next full moon rises. - And then? - Oh, this part is good. Xia will open the doorway to the Nether WorIds. You were saying? Thus ending our very existence. It's all so dire. You see, sister, there's no bounty too great for saving this worId. Say we fancy the idea for a moment. And that there is this massive bounty in goId, of course. Aye, what makes you think us three here can stop this Vampire Queen? I toId her we're Iovers not fighters. When need to have a pIan, something Iess daunting, more rewarding. - I am at a Ioss. - We shouId take the traditionaI action, and hire mercenaries, Iike our dear father. Yes, yes, but we're under time constraints. In onIy a fortnight the moon will be full. - I have a thought. - It was onIy a matter of time. MaIia, you will find father and see if he has any ideas on the matter, and I with what funds to princess has on her presentIy will arrange for a dozen armed men. Not just any men, no, no, no, but the type with honor and courage enough to win back AbeIar. By the gods I've heard that there are experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria, preciseIy the type of warriors that we needs. So, the Princess. she can wait here at Durris for our return, you know, hoIding down the fortress - sort of thing. - Or Iet us spIit the funds you possess, give us both a chance to hire the best warriors we can find on our way. Aye, that couId work as well. Well, sister? You take me as a fooI at your own periI. You are both much Iess than I'd hoped. At the prison I spoke to the magistrate and he gave me your recent histories, - theft, assauIt, cheating, embezzIing. . . - Right. - Pick pocket and street whore? - I have never picked a pocket. You're both are the Iowest of character, but my sister was firm and we must find our father and you are my onIy hope. We'll need horses. I can acquire them. - Are there other brothers and sisters? - Ah, yeah, yeah, she's a day's ride away in a village called Chiba Agreed then to Chiba Village. Our father still Iives? I suppose. Last summer he was carousing in the secret of Nobu. That was years ago. The dog is IikeIy dead as a cock, though, rotting in some dungeon. 50,000 goId pieces. - 55 - 50 50 and that's my finaI word. And I suggest we seaI this fast. What's going on, sir? Having an adventure, sister? - A bitch dog. - Come to Iose again? It isn't Iong now. An entire new worId. I use Xia's body as a conduct. It's a doorway. What have you Iearned? The princess seeks one Iike her father. The warrior who heIped with Mitadonia. He can see us fall into the Abyss. Reduce her to dust. ShouId I kill them now, the Princess and these two fooIs? Learn the whereabouts of this father. As you wish. I tried to find father once right here. - What was it Iike? - Ah, it was Iike this. except for peopIe trying to kill me. - It's earIy yet. - Maybe they'll remember you. Oh, MaIia, they wouId if they were still aIive. I meant what was it Iike to see him? I didn't see father. I found Rajan, our haIf sister. Stay put. What does Rajan do here as a trade? You mean when she's not drunk or passed out? Hello sister. I have a wonderfuI opportunity for you. No thank you. It did not work out Iast time. It's onIy because you Iack a sense of humor. What do you think they seek? This drink. Sister toId me great stories about father. aIthough I thought she spoke of a hired mercenary sent to save AbeIar. That was before I knew he was my father. The man who I thought was my father, the King, well he was killed by Xia. You really want to know who father is, God's truth? Yes. Our father is the Iowest form of cowardIy dog, a man who takes advantage of wives or widows, sells out his cohorts for coin and runs from a reaI fight. That's who father is. What's the matter? You don't Iike the truth? You married, have sons? LuckiIy no. They're not so bad to Iook at. Your whores? Rajan, say hello to your sisters. - More famiIy? - And with your heIp, we four. will save AbeIar before the full moon. The full moon is six nights away. Time is short. Ho, an adventure. AIana AIana? I'd forgotten her. She's all grown and ready to Ieave this stink hoIe. AIana, your favorite uncIe has returned. Don't you remember me? I remember. As formidabIe as she is, the girI is but a girI. I meant no offense, niece. I taught her a few things in my days as emperor's assassin. Yes, I can see. Sir, this is the most serious and most dangerous mission. It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy. The Vampire Queen. - Yes, and it is not suitabIe for a chiId. - You think I'd be afraid. Look, it's time my AIana saw the worId, had a few wiId, bIoody adventures. And vampires and sorcery are all a part of that. The truth is, she will Iove many and Ieave many more choking on their entraiIs. A sister, heh? And a princess no Iess. Do you pIan to rob her? Give me a IittIe credit. This comes at a good time. I was worried. How so? With my adventuring and killing days were behind, I wouIdn't be abIe to give her proper parenting. Oh, betting brutes, horribIe wars, ghastIy death, and it's all still ahead of you. I am sure it's all with my daughter. The gods must choose to smiIe upon me. You wouId really cut my throat back there? Of course, uncIe. Yours particuIarIy. Sweet girI. What of grandfather? Might he want to go as well? Grandfather? Our father? Aye. He might crave one Iast good battIe before setting down the sword? - He's still killing? - Oh, that rascaI, his sword is aIways poised. Want to meet the oId dog? Oh, Iet's be off. There are kingdoms to save and men to bed. I prefer wenches. Then he Iives? Why not use your sorcery to destroy them all? Sorcery hasn't been needed untiI the full moon, but it's now needed instead of your coId steeI, Kara. Her father was a great sorcerer callousIy taken by gods Iet aIone by human yet this one day. But how is that possibIe against their power? Because there exists a breed of creatures who fears nothing. So they can accompIish anything. You describe a distinct human trait. We cannot chance these five meeting up with one called father. They wouId aIert him. Aye. So what do you suggest? I think an earIy strike as they arrive in Nobu Village shouId do it. I wouId need two of those Iike myseIf, day waIkers. And the father shouId be found. See who wants their bIood. After I manage this task. What do you wish, to be made queen? No, I want my souI back. After all the power you have feIt in your veins? I want to be who I am, what I am, not one of you. ShouId I fear you, Kara? You know what Iies within me and I am what you need me to be. ShouId I fear you? You aIready do. We will wait 'till there is some separation. Then take them one by one. I don't expect much resistance except by the princess. All in all, they are a pathetic group. He comes here every evening to sell his catch. Catch? He's a fisherman now. Now, now, Iadies, you'll have to accept my apoIogy. I must Ieave. There's an adventure in the offing. Now, mark my words, if I didn't have to go off and save Emperor Micah's kingdom, I wouId sureIy have you all to bed. again. Can I see that spear right there, pIease? Never mind. There, why the Iong face, huh? It is for the grand adventure that we Iive. And it's not just the adventure itseIf. It's the willingness to risk everything for it. Something chased you off the street. What is your troubIe, girI? Something very terribIe. And what was that? A vampire. I know it's dead, but still I saw the things. You see, I beIieve you, girI. This day there are vampires in Nobu. So, I'm off. my, couId you send an oId rogue off with a proper farew I beIieve we have an adventurer here. I can taste it. May the gods smiIe on your adventure, chiId. The next time a warning wouId be nice. Where can I find her? Come now. Levana, - Kara? - Your Highness. You know what do with them. This is your Iife now? I have no Iife just the sins. BIeak and bIeaker. That princess and they that hoId it are under the sword. Mind your own business, sir. Nobu has aIways been a refuge where marriages are by and Iarge human. Now changes come to Nobu. The worId evoIves. Aye, mostIy for the bad. Do we have a quarreI, sir? Have we met? In the days before I sought the peace of the sea, I knew your kind. Well, maybe I am sick but I was pIeasured by the killing. They deserved to die. I Ioved hearing their suffering, seeing their terror, and the begging and screaming. There was reaI pIeasure in that. Sometimes Iife does not unfoId as it shouId, and I do not have to expIain myseIf to you. I ask again, do we have a quarreI, sir? I am presentIy engaged. Did I do your mother, huh? So, where is this renowned father? Will our father show his face to you, sir? A shallow womanizer who fashions himseIf a dashing wit. Perhaps we cannot hear your whimpering, sir. Pathetic paIter. I know you'll have my head for that, but not if I have yours first. What is this? I wouId appreciate that back. Come and take it. I ask you once if we had a quarreI. I knew the princess. Now we have a quarreI. Joy that's not marred by Iove. We have much to ceIebrate now that the full moon is seen. You, me, the great Iove affair we shared. The Iove by which you destroyed my father, and had me with your stick to dust. But I harbor no grudge. Well, perhaps just a bit of heartbreak and spite. And bring that ridicuIous rebate of a weapon of yours. What does that make him? Is he an active vampire or is he a quarter vampire? I mean, what. . . what is it? Do you kill everyone you see? You know, next time a warning wouId be nice. <i>Once again, for passengers traveling on Flight 1457.</i> <i>. to Orlando, please take advantage of the boarding bag-check announcement.</i> <i>You'll pick it up at baggage claim in Orlando.</i> <i>It's a really full flight today.</i> <i>- Hey. - Yeah, Jon Neal here.</i> <i>You just had sex with me in a hotel and left without saying goodbye.</i> Yeah, it ended up being delayed, so.

That's the thing. They want him to see someone. I was wondering if you could take a look at him. - I'm not really that kind of doctor. - Oh. Ha, ha. I didn't know. I just thought. Maybe I can refer someone, though. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's treatable. - Okay. - We'll find someone, have them take a look. - Shouldn't be a problem. - Okay. - All right. - Yup. - Thanks, doc. - You're welcome. Why doesn't anybody help him? Is he okay? Read the posts. Some say it was staged. An art project. Some say the authorities wouldn't do an autopsy. Covered it up. - Covered what up? - We don't know. Maybe Minamata disease. You know, from mercury in the fish. There have been outbreaks in the past. Fishing industry suppresses it. - "Industrial disease." - Yeah, but it's just one man. - We don't know what happened. - Just one man on video. Not everyone has the foresight to die in front of a camera. The ones we don't see worry me. Fish is shipped all over the world from there. How many people read your paper over a plate of sushi? Alan, we have almost no freelance budget anymore, and after H1. You wait. A few days, this will be tweeted and YouTubed all over the planet. We don't wanna be the paper that cries wolf. I'll show it to Hobart. He does our health stuff. You're gonna give him my story? You're gonna give him my story, aren't you? No, Alan, I'm trying to help you. It's just one man on a bus. - I taped this meeting. - We need more information than that. <i>This story runs in the Chronicle, I will sue your ass.</i> Great. Okay, bye, Alan. Don't call me anymore.

He said he was feeling very warm in Mrs. Tatum's class. I took his temperature again since I called. It was a touch over a hundred. Okay. Well, first his mom and now the mighty Clark, huh? All right, let's go get some soup for you and Mom. Hope you feel better, Clark, okay? Okay. Thank you. Thattaboy. We're gonna beat this thing down by Turkey Day. <i>I'm in Texas. I'll try it. I'll try anything once.</i> <i>Ha, ha. That's not true.</i> Jory's going straight from the band trip to her mom's place. And my job interview got pushed to next week. I'm not really sure what that means. Hopefully nothing. Hey. My arm. Come here, sit down, sit down, sit down. Watch your feet. Come on. Come on. Come on, honey. Okay, what happened? Did you take too much of that flu shit? Honey? Beth, Beth. Hey, hey, hey. Honey, honey. Beth. Jesus. Jesus. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Hey, Beth. - Mom? - No, no, no. Uh. Stay there, Clark. Don't. Just go. Go up to your room, honey. Uh. Honey, honey. - Beth. - Beth, can you hear me? My name's Dr. Arrington. You're in the hospital. You had a seizure this morning, Beth. - She have a history of seizures? - No, no, no. - Allergies? - Uh, I think she's allergic to penicillin. - She fall recently? Hit her head? - No, she came back from a trip. What about drugs? MDMA? Ecstasy? No. No, we don't do that. - Okay, let's get some help in here. - Jesus. Beth. Beth. Sir, you have to go. You have to go. Let's get a line in her. And give me 2 milligrams of Ativan, please. So, um, despite all our efforts, she failed to respond. - Okay. - And her heart stopped and unfortunately, she did die. Right. - I'm sorry, Mr. Emhoff. - I know this is hard to accept. Okay. I mean, so can I go talk to her? Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry. Your wife is dead. I mean, I just saw her. We were just at home. Is there somebody that we can call? Someone who you think should be here with you? I mean, we had dinner. We had pizza. She said she was jet-lagged. You mentioned that she was away. Hong Kong? We checked the latest bulletins. The only things there were measles and H1 N1 and this was not that. Then what was it? We don't always know. I mean, some people get a disease and live, some get sicker and die. We're gonna have to notify the medical examiner and they may request an autopsy. Or if you wish, we can order one. But I can't guarantee it's gonna tell you any more than I can. I mean, my best guess is that this was either meningitis or encephalitis and with encephalitis, we're in the dark a lot of the time. If it was summer, I might say a bug bite, you know, West Nile. - I don't know. - Herpes can cause encephalitis. She didn't have herpes. - What are you talking about? - Okay. What happened to her? - What happened to her? - Okay, okay. Mr. Emhoff, there are grief counselors who are very helpful with this sort of passing, okay? You might find some resolution there. Now, I am sorry. Hello? Hang up the phone and call 911 right now. Right now. 911. He said he had a headache, so I put him to bed. I don't think he's breathing. Clark. Clark. Oh, my God, is he dead? <i>What we are hearing from Beijing is that the outbreak is contained.</i> <i>. to the Chrysanthemum complex in Hong Kong.</i> <i>Two deaths and 10 suspected cases.</i> <i>How are we defining "contained?"</i> <i>They're using the same protocols established for SARS.</i> <i>They're quarantining the complex and screening for symptoms.</i> <i>Kowloon is the most densely populated area in the world.</i> <i>. and Hong Kong is a harbor.</i> <i>It's going to spread.</i> <i>Hong Kong is sending us blood samples.</i> We're also looking at samples from London. Two clusters: One at a hotel, the other at a health club. Five dead, encephalitis. And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo. - Three dead in that cluster. - Any of them travel to China or London? We're checking. Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here. Can you hear me? Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal? - I want you to open your eyes if you can. - He's breathing, right? I couldn't wake him. I got home, I couldn't wake him. We both woke up sick this morning. Watch your head. Hmm. Well, the sulci are obliterated. Let's look at the base. Oh, my God. You want me to take a sample, or.? I want you to move away from the table. - Should I call someone, or.? - Call everyone. <i>Well, these things happen up there from time to time.</i> <i>Meningitis in a college dorm after a swim meet.</i> <i>. or West Nile in some summer camp near a lake.</i> I was reading that last summer they had an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis. A hundred and three cases, mainly children. Well, it's probably too cold up there for that right now. As of last night, there were five deaths and 32 cases. There's a cluster in an elementary school. That's the kind of thing you have to be prepared for. It's gonna be all over the news. What's your single overriding communications objective? We're isolating the sick and quarantining those who we believe were exposed. Okay, good. As of this moment, you and I are attached at the cell phone. If you need resources, call me. If you get into a political dogfight, call me. <i>If you find yourself wide awake, staring at the walls at 3 a.m.</i> <i>. wondering why you took the job, call me.</i> I sure hope you packed something warmer than that. We're looking at around zero with the windchill. Don't want you to catch cold. Do you wanna go to the hotel first, get situated? I'd prefer to get started, if that's possible. - Okay. - How far is the office? About a half-hour from here. Your dad's in isolation. You can go up to the window, pick up the phone, and you can talk to him. - Hey. - Dad. - Hey. - Are you sick? No, no, no. I'm. Uh. This is all just, you know, a precaution. They're, you know, just making sure. But you were with them. You could still get it. No, I won't. Um, they said this happens really, really fast. And, uh, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with me. We're okay. We're okay. And Clark? Yeah, you know, I, um. I wasn't there. I went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, Beth. And, uh, I just didn't. I. I left him with, uh, Carrie Anne. I should have been there. - I could have helped. - No, no, no. Honey, no, no. It's good that you weren't there. I'm happy. If something had happened to you, I mean, I'd. Honey, you're here now, you know. I'm happy about that. I'm happy about that. When are you coming home? Soon. Very soon. They, you know. - Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's? - No. - Just stay in Wisconsin. - No. She doesn't need me. She's got Dan. I live here. You don't have anybody. I'm not leaving you. We have 47 cases and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon. It's a weekend. These numbers might be low. People are staying home for a couple days, see if they get better. At this point, I think we have to believe this is respiratory. - Maybe fomites too. - What's that, fomites? Uh, it refers to transmission from surfaces. The average person touches their face 2- or 3000 times a day. - Two- or 3000 times a day? - Three to five times every waking minute. In between, we're touching doorknobs water fountains, elevator buttons and each other. Those things become fomites. Is this something we wanna release to the press? Respiratory and fomites? - How's the public gonna react? - Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie will keep people from getting in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes. We need to walk the governor through this before we freak everybody out. I mean, heh, we can't even tell people right now what they should be afraid of. We tried that with swine flu. All we did was get healthy people scared. It's the biggest shopping weekend of the year. We need to consider closing schools. And who stays home with the kids? People that work at stores. Government workers. People that work at hospitals. When will we know what this is? What causes it, what cures it? Things that keep people calm. What we need to determine is this: For every person who gets sick how many other people are they likely to infect? So for seasonal flu, that's usually about one. Smallpox, on the other hand, it's over three. Now, before we had a vaccine polio spread at a rate between four and six. Now, we call that number the R-nought. R stands for the reproductive rate of the virus. Any ideas what that might be for this? How fast it multiplies depends on a variety of factors. The incubation period, how long a person is contagious. Sometimes people can be contagious without even having symptoms. We need to know that too. We need to know how big the population of people susceptible to the virus might be. So far that appears to be everyone with hands, a mouth and a nose. Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic. So it's an epidemic now. An epidemic of what? We sent samples to the CDC. In 72 hours, we'll know what it is, if we're lucky. Clearly, we're not lucky. What do we got? A young woman in Minnesota, recently traveled to China. Son also died. As of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths. - Did you have a good Thanksgiving? - I worked. You? Really? Texas. Salmonella. Pretty limited. - Mine was great, thanks. - Oh. It's pleomorphic, but tends toward ovoid in shape. I see structures on the surface that look like glycoproteins but there's nothing morphologically pathognomonic. We tested all her antibodies. I didn't see much cross-reactivity. Her body had no idea what to do with it. It just kept amplifying. Send it to Sussman in San Francisco. If he doesn't know what it is, nobody does. It shows novel characteristics and appears to be chimeric in origin. Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length and containing six to 10 genes. Typical of a paramyxovirus. It's Godzilla, King Kong and Frankenstein all in one. - Hold on. Shit, I'll call you back. - You've got it in there. - Get away from here. - Where'd it come from? Military? You're not a doctor and you're not a writer. Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am. Blogging is not writing. It's graffiti with punctuation. I am a journalist, and there's informed discussion on the blogosphere that this is a biological weapon. You wanna talk to me, call my office and make an appointment. - Dr. Cheever? - Yes. - Do you have a moment? - Sure. We found him. Tell the unit on the way to his house to come in. Excuse me. Who are you? My name is Dennis French with the Department of Homeland Security. And what's this all about? Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us in the emergency operations center. We can discuss it there. This happened in Kowloon. Today we've got workers at a casino in Macao striking over conditions. Three have died in one bunkhouse. CIA thinks there may be a connection. Casinos are of particular concern to Homeland Security. Someone's ready to blow themselves up at a pizzeria or the local market the thought of getting themselves sick with smallpox and walking through a crowded casino must have crossed their mind. What did they die of, the three? Reports are vague. Seizures, comas. We've reached out to the WHO, see what they know. If you were gonna plan it, can't think of a better time. - Plan what? - An attack. Is there any way someone could weaponize the bird flu? Someone doesn't have to weaponize the bird flu. The birds are doing that. <i>Officials are reporting the closing of Mondale Elementary School.</i> <i>. in suburban Minneapolis.</i> <i>. in response to the recent outbreak of a still-unknown disease.</i> <i>. that has so far taken the life of a school nurse and three students.</i> <i>Other schools in District 281 will remain open.</i> <i>. but parents have been notified to keep home any children with symptoms.</i> <i>The Department of Health is awaiting confirmation.</i> <i>. but sources say these new cases may be connected to the sudden death.</i> <i>. of a 34-year-old AIMM Alderson executive.</i> <i>. and her 6-year-old son this holiday weekend.</i> Hello. I'm Dr. Mears. I'm an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer and I'm here from Atlanta to find out what happened to Beth Emhoff. Okay, I'm gonna ask you some questions and see if. There was a package she messengered from Hong Kong. - I opened it with scissors. I'm not sure if. - No. It shouldn't be an issue. Virus can't live for days on a box. We did Pilates together. I called her after she got back. I never heard from her. - So you had no contact with her? - No. - Did she go to the class? - I didn't see her there. We had coffee the day she left. I think she might have moved my cup because it was on some papers. - I can't remember. - How many days ago? About 10 days. That's okay. The incubation period is less than that. Is there anyone else who might have had contact with her? - This was everyone. - Aaron Barnes did. <i>Barnes? He worked on another floor.</i> <i>There were documents she needed. He picked her up from the airport.</i> <i>He picked her up from the airport? Where is he?</i> Hello? <i>- Hello? Mr. Barnes? - Hello? Yes.</i> This is Dr. Mears from the Centers for Disease Control. <i>- I believe. - Hi.</i> Hi. I believe you may have had contact with Beth Emhoff last week. <i>Yeah, I picked her up at the airport. What's this about?</i> <i>- And how are you feeling today? - Uh, pretty cruddy, to be honest.</i> <i>My head is pounding. I probably picked up some bug.</i> <i>- Where are you right now? - I'm on the bus, heading to work.</i> <i>- I'd like you to get off immediately. - What?</i> - He's on a bus. - Where? <i>- Where? Where's the bus, Aaron? - Um. Uh.</i> <i>- Lake and Lyndale. What's going on? - Lake and Lyndale.</i> I really need you to get off that bus. It's possible you've come in contact with an infectious disease and you're highly contagious. Do you understand? <i>I want you to get off now. And stay away from other people.</i> Now what do I do? <i>Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anyone.</i> <i>That's the most important thing.</i> <i>- We'll send somebody to meet the bus. - Okay.</i> <i>I'm on my way to you now, Aaron.</i> What about my kids? I touched them. It was a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory. She traveled a lot for work. Did her work involve contact with livestock in any way? - Did you keep any pets at home? - No. No. Did she mention seeing anyone who was sick? Anyone on a plane? No. She went through customs in Chicago at 11:15 a.m and then took a flight to Minneapolis at 6 p.m. Any idea what she did in Chicago during that layover? Did she have meetings? Is there any reason she might have left the airport? Why? I mean, is there someone sick in Chicago? Uh, before we were married, my wife had a relationship with a man in Chicago named Jon Neal. Is Jon Neal sick? Did we get this from him? - We're investigating all the possibilities. - No. I think I have a right to know. Look at where I am here. Look at where I am here. - I can't disclose that information. I'm sorry. - No, I'm just. I'm just trying to understand. I know. We're getting the same results as Sussman. We've sequenced the virus, determined its origin and we've modeled the way it enters the cells of the lung and the brain. The virus contains both bat and pig sequences. The dark green is pig, and the light green is bat. And here you can see the crossover event. Uh, bat, bat, and pig, bat. And here is a model of the virus and how it attaches to its host. The blue is virus, and the gold is human, and the red is the viral attachment protein and the green is its receptor in the human cells. These receptors are found in the cells of both the respiratory tract and the central nervous system. And the virus attaches to the cell like a key slipping into a lock. Somewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat. - You ever seen anything like this before? - No. And it's still changing. It's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out. It doesn't have anything else to do. So we have a novel virus with a mortality rate in the low 20s no treatment protocol, and no vaccine at this time. That is correct. From here on out, I want no one working on this except at BSL-4. Last thing we need is for this to walk out of the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe. Dr. Sussman's office. <i>Lan, hi. Ally Hextall.</i> We need to shut you down. This thing's too hot. Uh. <i>- BSL-4 only at this point. - I think that's a mistake.</i> Cook your samples. Uh, destroy everything. <i>- We can't risk it. - We're making progress.</i> You limit this to government-run BSL-4s, it'll take forever. I can do this. I'm sorry. Yeah. Sure, Ally. <i>Can you repeat the affected cities so far?</i> <i>Again, the affected cities are.</i> <i>. Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and Salt Lake.</i> <i>We expect that list to grow.</i> <i>. as people return home from their holidays.</i> <i>Yes?</i> <i>Dr. Cheever, how many people are infected.</i> <i>. and how many have died?</i> <i>Those numbers are changing as we speak.</i> .so any figure I give you is likely to be low. We're still calculating the mortality rate at this time. Uh, Dr. Cheever, are you concerned that the CDC faces a credibility issue here after the perceived overreaction to H1 N1? I'd rather the story be that we overreacted than that many people lost their lives because we didn't do enough. That's why we're here. <i>It's also why the World Health Organization is sending an epidemiologist to Hong Kong.</i> <i>Hard to know what it is without where it came from.</i> <i>Our first job with these things is to find ground zero.</i> <i>Figure out how it jumped into the population.</i> <i>We do know that a patient in Minnesota.</i> <i>. traveled to that part of the world.</i> We believe that there are approximately 89,000 cases at this point and that we are heading toward 267,000. <i>And from there, using our model, based on an R-nought of two.</i> <i>. here is where we expect to be in 48 hours.</i> <i>Dr. Cheever, perhaps you can update us on the research.</i> As of right now, no one has found a good way to grow the virus in cells. <i>Why is that?</i> Because it kills every cell we put it in. A pig, a chicken, everything. Until we can grow it, and a great deal of it, we can't experiment with it. And until then, we can't vaccinate against it. <i>Have you found any treatment at all? Any antivirus? Anything?</i> No. Beth Emhoff used an ATM at a casino in Macao. Citibank released her records. We have her using the machine at 10:43 just off the casino floor. I wanna see the casino security footage for two hours on either side of that. Is there a problem? Oh, they're from my village. They found a new cluster there. Oh. - Is your family still there? - My mother has symptoms. I'll get you the footage you require. Excuse me. Dr. Sussman, I heard that they were shutting us down. Yeah, I just have to deal with the samples. If it's just a matter of destroying them, I can do it. No, I'll take care of it. You go on home. I'll do that, and then I just want to recheck some data. <i>He grew it.</i> He tried antibodies and immunological MAC outlines but the key was a fetal-bat cell line from Geelong. - We didn't have it. - He grew it in a BSL-3. Ally, what the hell was he doing working with it in a BSL-3? Ignoring me. He's gonna publish. Shit. What does he want? A box of cigars. He had a choice, Ellis. He could have gone into business for himself. There's no doubt he was approached, but he gave it to us. - And we're supposed to trust him? - We don't have a choice. <i>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States.</i> <i>. and the World Health Organization in Switzerland.</i> <i>. confirmed today that Dr. Lan Sussman of San Francisco.</i> <i>. has succeeded in growing the MEV-1 virus in a laboratory setting.</i> <i>Officials at the CDC cautioned that the breakthrough is only the first step.</i> <i>. toward developing a vaccine.</i> <i>. which is likely still months away from human trials.</i> <i>The WHO estimates the number of people infected worldwide to be over 8 million.</i> <i>Now it all changes.</i> Sussman gets anointed by the National Academy of Sciences and every pharmaceutical executive gets a hard-on. They'll be growing the virus in every lab on Earth. It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey. Crikey, first we shoot them into space, now we'll be shooting them full of virus. So this is where we need your expertise. Pharmaceutical stocks are already through the roof. What's next? Where's the opportunity? Now, you saw that Shinko bus thing day one. That's why we wanted this meeting. When I turned on my computer this morning I had over 2 million unique visitors, all looking for the truth. You think they wanna see me talking to some hedge-fund guy? Mr. Krumwiede, we don't invent need here. We just analyze it, predict it. You tell me what it costs to look into your crystal ball. You're familiar with forsythia? - No, I'm not. - What I'm about to tell you is backed up by testimonials that will appear shortly in the media. I'll be talking about it extensively in the days ahead. What does forsythia do? It's the cure. <i>If I'm immune, can't you use my blood to cure this?</i> Blood serums can take a long time to make, and are very expensive. But the good news here is that you're not going to get sick. Okay. Um. Then that would mean that my daughter can't get it either, right? I can't promise you that. But isn't that something that she would inherit from me? Well, half her immune system came from you but the other half came from her mother. Almost three hours. I need to see a doctor or a supervisor or something. I wanna know if he has this thing on the news. I'm sorry, sir, we're doing the best we can. Can I just speak to an administrator or something? Anybody. Sir, please be patient. We'll get you in. He's sick! My wife makes me take off my clothes in the garage. Then she leaves out a bucket of warm water and some soap. And then she douses everything in hand sanitizer after I leave. I mean, she's overreacting, right? Not really. And stop touching your face, Dave. Okay, we'll put the air lock here. I want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece. The most febrile cases at this end. We'll set up triage outside, FEMA can handle food in the basement and we'll need to be operational within the next 24 to 48 hours. Gotcha. - Nice job, Dave. This will work. - Thanks. Now find me three more just like it. Excuse me, Dr. Mears. Is this coming out of your budget or ours? WHO has confirmed that the Hong Kong sample matches London, Tokyo and Abu Dhabi and we're seeing large clusters in from Frankfurt and Cairo. <i>Are we any closer to an index patient?</i> Could be your Beth Emhoff or the guy on the bus in Japan. Someone else who crawled off the grid. How you doing? <i>Yeah, good. I'm going into a meeting with.</i> No, I didn't ask what you were doing, I asked how you were doing. How are you doing? I'm, uh. I'm fine. <i>Fine?</i> <i>You know, I was in the field for 15 years.</i> <i>I've seen a lot of shit. If you're not doing fine, you can tell me.</i> You ever have to tell a man who just lost his wife and stepson that his wife was cheating on him before she died? <i>No, I haven't.</i> <i>I'm sure you did the best you could.</i> <i>- Uh-uh. - You sound tired.</i> <i>You gotta try to remember to sleep once in a while.</i> <i>When was the last time you had something that didn't come out of a vending machine?</i> Taco Bell. <i>Local officials are now saying over 3000 cases have been confirmed.</i> <i>. in the western suburbs.</i> <i>. as well as the first cases reported in Ramsey, Carlton and Saint Louis counties.</i> <i>. as the virus continues to spread.</i> <i>- Got it! - A state Health Department spokesperson.</i> <i>. at this hour is appealing to hospitals as far away as lowa for medicine.</i> No, don't open that door. Don't open the door. - It's Andrew. - Uh, sorry, Andrew, I can't let you in. I just came to give my condolences, Mr. Emhoff. I understand. Thank you. Uh, but I can't let you in. I'll just leave them, then. No, actually, you should take them. Uh, thank you, though. - I'll call you later. - Bye. We just, you know, aren't gonna take any chances. - Do you know how to play this? - No, I have no idea what's going on. But it looks fun. You wanna try? Okay. We'll see. Hello. Hi. Oh, yeah, my turn, okay. This one. Crab. Okay. - Hey. - Oh! Aah! Oh. Oh, my God. I'll do. What is that? Which one is this? - Coin. - It's a coin. Oh, okay, okay, okay. It's transmission. So we just need to know which direction. But we don't know where it comes from. I would like to suggest that the virus started before Macao and maybe here in Hong Kong. You're considering pronouncements with serious implications. A virus is too small to be seen on video camera. Please, God. Please, God. No, no, no. Hello? This is Dr. Erin Mears in Room 821. I need you to get me the names of everyone who serviced this room in the last 24 hours. Also, you need to get in touch with the waiter who brought me my room service last night. I need all of their numbers. Home, cell, everything, yes. <i>Mears?</i> Dr. Cheever I think I'm sick. <i>What? What's going on? What kind of symptoms do you have?</i> Can't swallow. Severe headache. Ahem. <i>What's your temperature?</i> <i>- 101.8. - Uh, listen, you can't. You just.</i> <i>- You can't panic now, okay? - I know.</i> <i>- Are you alone? - I've definitely infected other people.</i> <i>You don't know that.</i> <i>- So, what should I do? - Well, I want you to stay in your room.</i> <i>I'll call the Health Department, tell them you're there.</i> <i>- Erin, just. You're gonna be okay. - No, I know. I know.</i> <i>- Okay. - You gotta send somebody else.</i> <i>Yes, but you don't worry about that right now, okay?</i> <i>- Hey, I'm. - You take care of yourself.</i> I'm sorry I couldn't finish. <i>That's. Never mind that. Let me see what I can do about getting you back here.</i> <i>- I'm gonna get you home if I can, healthy. - Thank you.</i> <i>- Now, you hang in there. - Bye.</i> <i>- Bye. - Bye.</i> The problem is, we just can't take delivery of the bodies. We have insurance issues with our own employees with our union, not to mention the health of the mourners, to consider. I just. I wanna bury my wife and my stepson and have a service where our friends and our family can come and pay their respects and grieve. I understand, and I am truly sorry about your loss. Have you considered other options? How can they do that? We have a family plot here. They want us to think about cremation. They just say that it's the safest thing in a situation like this. I wanna be buried with my daughter and grandson with Jack and my parents. I want us all together. They're not gonna take them, Sarah. They're not gonna take the bodies. I'll figure something out. I'll figure something out. She made mistakes, Mitch but I know she loved you very much. I'm gonna use some of these to get us some drinks, okay? <i>You have not reached Jon Neal.</i> <i>. but you will if you leave a message.</i> Hi. It's me. Um. I checked the flights, and I can actually get an earlier flight that would give me a five-hour layover in Chicago so let me know if that's something that you'd like me to do. - That's for you, okay? - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Oh, my God. Thank. - Emhoff gave it to the Ukrainian. - That just shows contact. Maybe it went the other way. What about Li Fai? - He was on the casino floor. - Watch this. Whoa. Oh, good. Okay, come on. Let's get one together. Ready? Cheers. Mm. Let's go. That's him with Emhoff at 12:08. I can show you the Ukrainian woman on the security camera in the elevator going back to her room 20 minutes earlier. She was gone before Li Fai started work. It came from here. Emhoff is the index patient. We need to know everywhere she went before the casino. I want to see her itinerary again. They say the French and Americans have a cure. They're manufacturing it in secret. WHO knows, but they're in bed with the Americans. - Who says? - The Internet. - The Internet? And you believe it? - I don't know. How's your mother? We tried forsythia, but she wasn't strong. There's a mass grave in Lan Tau. I'm sorry. I'm taking this to the ministry. We need to send this to Geneva. I need you to come with me. - What are you doing? - Please. No. What's going on? Sun Feng. What's going on? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. We couldn't wait any longer. While they cure each other, we're here at the end of the line. This is what is left of my village. - Are they sick? - Not yet. And we're gonna keep it that way. You'll stay here with us until they find a cure. How is that gonna help? You're gonna get us to the front of the line. Dr. Mears. Dr. Cheever called again. We're just having a hard time with the logistics of evacuating you. Finding a plane and all. I got your phone. Dr. Cheever, he asked you to call if you feel up to it. Now, we're setting up a special ward for medical personnel and first responders at the university. I wanna move you there but the nurses' union is calling a work stoppage until protocols are in place. There are volunteers, but it's just. It's hard right now to know where's the right place. You're asking me to spend a lot of resources on one person and right now, I can't do that. Dr. Mears would agree with me. She's one of our own, Lyle. We sent her up there. Okay, I sent her up there. I would like to go get her back. We have a plane with an isolation pod to bring our people in the field home when they're sick, right? What's going on, Lyle? There's a sick congressman from Illinois in D.C. He was in Chicago over the holiday. They're using the pod to fly him home. Then they're closing down Midway and O'Hare. The governor is calling the National Guard. They're setting up roadblocks. They're shutting down trade, public transportation. The Teamsters are pulling drivers off the road. - People are still gonna slip through. - Yes, they will. The Secret Service is moving the president underground. Congress is figuring out how to work online. When the word goes out there will be a run on the banks, gas stations, grocery stores, you name it. People will panic. The virus will be the least of our worries. It will tip over now. We just need to make sure that nobody knows until everybody knows. <i>My temperature's 101.</i> Higher than it was earlier. My head hurts and my throat feels like it's closing. This is forsythia. I've been taking it since the onset of the symptoms. <i>If I'm here tomorrow, you'll know it works.</i> <i>Truth Serum Now. I'm Alan Krumwiede.</i> <i>How many people are gonna die?</i> Well, in 1918 1 percent of the population died from Spanish flu. It was novel, like this, no one had ever seen it before. <i>- One percent of America? - One percent of the world.</i> As many as 70 million people could die, baby, maybe more. <i>- So, what do we do? - I don't know. We try to figure it out.</i> <i>This is why I sent Mears up there, to Minnesota.</i> <i>And now I can't get her back.</i> <i>She's sick, Aubrey, and I can't do anything for her.</i> <i>. because there are no nurses.</i> <i>- Why not? - Because they're on strike.</i> - How can they do that? - Because there's nothing they can do. We're putting healthy people next to sick people and hoping the healthy people don't get sick. <i>- I'm sorry, Ellis, but that's not your fault. - I sent her up there, Aubrey.</i> If one in four are dying, that means three out of four are living, right? <i>So the odds are in her favor.</i> I want you to get in your car and drive down here to Atlanta now. You hear me, Aubrey? What are you talking about? <i>I want you to get in your car and leave Chicago.</i> <i>I want you to drive here to Atlanta. Drive by yourself.</i> You do it. You do it now. Don't tell anyone and don't stop. Stay away from other people, understand? Keep your distance from other people. Call me when you're on the road, Aubrey. Roger. Did you hear.? I got people too, Dr. Cheever. We all do. Hello? <i>Hey, friend, what's up with blowing off dinner?</i> <i>- I'm sorry, Liz. - Why you so flaky? You feeling okay?</i> This flu sh. Stuff is really spooky. What does Ellis say? He says it's. He says it's serious. What do you mean, serious? Where are you? <i>- I'm getting out of town. - What?</i> I'm gonna tell you something and you're not gonna repeat it. - Cover your mouth, please. - Fuck off, lady. We will only be able to give out 50 doses today. - What? - That's our allotment. This is bullshit. Hey. There. Excuse me, there's a line here. Excuse me! Jesus. Where's the fire department? Is anyone even working here? Just get the cereal. - Jory, don't touch anything. - Help me. Okay, take your gloves off. Here, give me your hands. Okay. I want you to really rub this in. Okay, okay, come on. - Come on, come on. - Unh. Hey, get away from there. Get away. Lock the door. Get back in your car, sir. Get back in your car. - No, no, I'm not. I'm immune. - Stay back. I've already had it. - And my daughter's not sick. - She's sick? She's not, no. We're just trying to get to Wisconsin. The border is sealed. The governor has declared a quarantine. Get back in your car. No, we don't wanna go back there. We wanna go across. - There is no way across. Get in your car. - We're not sick. Get back in your car or I will detain you. Where? Get in the car! - What happened? - We have to go home. What are you doing here? I think I had a seizure. Oh. I can't. I can't find any in the stores. I tried. Look, I don't have any here. People broke in. I'm. I'm pregnant, Alan. And I have. I have money. I can give you some money. Lorraine, you shouldn't be out. - Please, Alan. - Go home. I'll bring it to you when I get it. I was wondering if I could get another blanket. This one's very damp now. I'm truly sorry, sir. We're out of blankets. We're hoping for more to be donated. We put the word out. What about the heat? Can we turn that up? I'll find out. - When did we run out of body bags? - Two days ago. We're trying to get more in from Canada, but they just wanna wait and see. <i>No more lies! No more lies! No more lies!</i> <i>There are stories on the Internet that in India and elsewhere.</i> .the drug ribavirin has been shown to be effective against this virus. Yet Homeland Security is telling the CDC not to make any announcements until stockpiles of the drug could be secured. Well, Dr. Gupta, there continue to be evaluations of several drugs. Ribavirin is among them. But right now, our best defense has been social distancing. No hand-shaking, staying home when you're sick washing your hands frequently. Can you tell us, to date, how many people have died from this virus? Very difficult. We're still working on, uh, confirming that number. There are 50 different states in this country which means there are 50 different Health Departments followed by 50 different protocols. Let me bring Alan Krumwiede into this debate as well. Uh, Alan's a freelance journalist. Uh, he was the first to track the "Shinko Bus Man" video. Uh, Alan, today on Twitter you wrote that the truth about this virus is being kept from the world by the CDC, by the World Health Organization to allow friends of the administration to benefit from it. <i>. both financially and physically.</i> Uh, there are therapies we know are effective right now, like forsythia and they don't even appear on the CDC website. On your blog, you also wrote that the World Health Organization is in bed with pharmaceutical companies? Because they are. That's who stands to gain from this. They're working hand in glove. <i>And the hand is reaching into our pockets.</i> The CDC is exploring forsythia and other homeopathic treatments. But right now, there's no science to back any of these claims. Or no way Dr. Cheever or the people who put him into power can profit from it. We're not ruling anything out. There are people who are sick, people who are dying, and we are doing. They're not keeping us safe from this any more than. We're concerned about every American citizen. Dr. Cheever is being a bit disingenuous when he says "every American citizen." We're working very hard to find out where this virus came from, treat it. <i>. and vaccinate against it if we can.</i> <i>We don't know all of that yet, we just don't.</i> <i>What we do know is that in order to become sick.</i> <i>. you have to first come in contact with a sick person or something they touched.</i> In order to get scared, all you have to do is come in contact with a rumor television or the Internet. <i>I think what Mr. Krumwiede is spreading is far more dangerous than the disease.</i> - Oh, really? - Yes. - That's funny. - What's funny? You're funny, because if you check on Facebook you'll find a communiqué attributed to Dr. Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaard about the quarantine of Chicago hours before it was announced to the public. That's why I think he's a bit disingenuous when he says equal care for all and not just his friends. Some pretty wild allegations here, Dr. Cheever. Can you tell us what communication appeared and when? What is the nature of your relationship with Nygaard? I'm not aware of anything attributed to me on any social network. I'm sure you're not. It is there. It is there. <i>Tell them what an R-nought of two really means, Dr. Cheever.</i> <i>Teach them some math. Hm?</i> <i>No? I'll do it.</i> On day 1, there were two people with it, and then there were four. And then it was 16, and you think you've got it in front of you but next it's 256, and then it's 65,000 and it's behind you, above you, and all around you. In 30 steps, it's a billion sick. Three months. It's a math problem you can do on a napkin. And that's where we're headed. And that's why you won't even tell us the number of the dead will you, Dr. Cheever? But you'll tell your friends when to get out of Chicago before anyone else has a chance. <i>They're looking for a scapegoat.</i> You just made it easy. The only reason we're not taking this to the attorney general is because we can't replace you right now. But there's gonna be an investigation. Do you understand that? And we don't wanna see you in front of the cameras anymore. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where did you come from? - It's mutated. - Which way, better or worse? It's moved into an African HIV AIDS population. The Durban cluster is highly divergent. We have a new R-nought, Ellis. It's not two anymore. <i>I thought you said once we could grow it, we could vaccinate against it.</i> We tried using dead virus combined with atrophins to boost immune response. And? No protective antibodies, a lot of dead monkeys. - Can you get to the good news? - Now we have to try a live attenuated virus. - Like with polio? - Exactly. The only danger with a live virus is the possibility that it will revert to wild type and kill the host. And when will we know about that? I'll ask the monkeys. As of right now, the mortality rate is fluctuating between 25 and 30 percent depending upon underlying medical conditions socioeconomic factors, nutrition, fresh water. With the new mutation we are predicting an R-nought of no less than four. And without a vaccine, we can anticipate that approximately one in 12 people on the planet will contract the disease. Folks, attention. We appreciate your patience and we're doing the best we can. We have exhausted our supply of meals ready-to-eat for today. What? Please remain calm. We'll be sending. Please. Hey. Can we get some help over here? Leave the park in an orderly fashion. Help me! - You okay? - Thank you. - Sorry, they got one of them. - Get the trucks! Get the trucks! There's. There's nothing in there! <i>As the death toll in the United States is now believed.</i> <i>. to have reached 2.5 million.</i> <i>. the president issued a statement today from an undisclosed location.</i> <i>. implementing mandatory curfews in major metropolitan areas.</i> <i>. after a second consecutive day of riots in Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and Phoenix.</i> <i>Absenteeism in law enforcement is nearing 25 percent.</i> <i>. according to reports.</i> <i>Because of the high volume of 911 calls.</i> <i>. please use the following directory:</i> <i>If you have symptoms, please hang up and call 612-188-6336.</i> <i>To report a death or for the removal of a body, please press 1.</i> Hello?

If neither of us have it, then we can't give it to each other. - Get away from her. - Dad! - Get away. Get away. - Dad! - What are you doing? - Stay there. Go home, Andrew. Get up. <i>Are we even close?</i> If we even had a viable vaccine right now we would still have to do human trials, and that would take weeks. And then we would have to get clearance and approval figure out manufacturing and distribution. That would take months. And then training survivors to give inoculations. More months, more deaths. <i>Well, Homeland Security wants to know.</i> .if we can put a vaccination in the water supply, like fluoride. Cure everyone all at once. I'm going home now, Ellis. It's getting late. <i>Merry Christmas.</i> Merry Christmas. - What are you doing? - It's okay, Dad. - No, it's not okay. - Do you remember Dr. Barry Marshall? Thought that bacteria caused ulcers, not stress. Gave himself the bug and then cured himself. You taught me about him. I'm testing my vaccine. No, this is different. I don't want to get you sick. Ally, you can't take that chance. Oh, Dad, you're here because you stayed in your practice treating sick people after everyone else went home. You took that chance. You took that chance every day. What? He won a Nobel Prize. - Yes, I know, Dad. Ha, ha. - Barry Marshall. <i>The Food and Drug Administration is accelerating approval.</i> <i>. of the MEV-1 vaccine.</i> <i>. currently in production at five secret locations in the U.S. And Europe.</i> <i>. saying the first doses could be available for human use within 90 days.</i> <i>The WHO estimates that it could take nearly a year.</i> <i>. to manufacture and distribute the necessary amount of the vaccine.</i> <i>. to stop the spread of the virus.</i> <i>. which so far has taken over 26 million lives worldwide.</i> <i>But as labs work around the clock to produce the life-saving formula.</i> <i>. the question remains: Who gets it first?</i> - Don't touch me. - Where is it? - We don't have it. - Bullshit. He works there. He gets it first. We don't have it. We have to wait. <i>- Aubrey? - Ellis?</i> Where are you? It's because they saw you on the news and they heard about what happened. - You all right? - They knew where you worked. They waited for you to leave. - Get up here. Come on. Let me look at you. - I tried to stop them. I tried. - Did they touch you? Did they look sick? - They had masks on, Ellis, and gloves. Don't tell me that. Aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow. You have to trust me, Ellis. They didn't touch me. <i>After the Spanish flu in 1918, you know, people got rich.</i> The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people, look it up. One man dies, another man makes money off his coffin. One country culls all their chickens, red meat goes into higher demand. I'm not the first person to make money off the fact that our immune system is a work in progress. The pharmaceutical industry do it every quarter. I don't think anyone is immune to opportunity, Alan. It's just that studies show that there is no proof that forsythia works. Who conducted the studies? What defines "works"? Against what strain of the virus? Did you know about the studies when we met the last time? We can get in a lot of trouble. Do you really think this Dr. Hextall CDC person is Jesus in a lab coat? The government rushed the trials. The lawyers indemnified the drug companies. Maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy or cancer 10 years from now. Who knows? You. The. The swine flu vaccine killed people back in 1976. Nerve disease. So we're all guinea pigs, starting from today. Just wait, they'll start listing side effects like the credits at the end of a movie. People trust you, Alan. If you tell them not to take it. That's right. They trust me. All 12 million unique visitors. I'm a trusted man stepping up to a microphone in front of a very large crowd. That's who I am. That's the brand. I say the right thing, nobody shows up for their shot. Maybe they'd rather roll the dice with forsythia. I can make that happen. I just wanna know I'm in the best position possible when I do. What does that mean, exactly? If I'm gonna step into the crosshairs, I wanna know what's in. - Is he with you? - What? Who? Are you wearing a wire? Alan, I didn't have a choice. They've seen your blog. Get him. - Far enough, far enough. - For what? Tell me, for what? Securities fraud, conspiracy, and most likely manslaughter. - It cured me. Forsythia cured me. - We'll see, Alan. This is entrapment. You can't take my blood. You can't, that's my property. We may never know where this disease came from. But we do know that this vaccine is the result of the courage and perseverance of a remarkable few. We shall now begin the drawing. John. The first MEV-1 vaccination are those people born on March 10th. March 10th. We remind all of you to stay 10 feet apart from each other while on line. Shouldn't you be downstairs? I'm tracking vaccine batch numbers. This is what you have to be doing right this minute? This is what I want to do right this minute. Take a bow, Ally. People have for a lot less. It's not that hard to give yourself an injection. What about Mears or my father or you? I'm gonna take a bow while you get hauled in front of Congress? What do I say when they ask about that? You tell them that I told a loved one who told a loved one and that I'd do it again. Without you. Ally, you have saved millions of lives. That's a great story. It also happens to be true. Now, how often can you say that? <i>The next citizens to receive the MEV-1 vaccination.</i> <i>. are those born on the date.</i> <i>What is that? January 11th.</i> Okay. All right, 144. That's. Ahem. There's still, uh, 200. More than 200 birthdays, hon, that haven't been called, so that's good. That's a good number. - What if they run out? - They're not gonna run out. They have enough to keep up with demand. They said that already. Maybe I'm immune like you and I don't even need it. That's not a chance we're gonna take. So instead we lose spring, we lose summer we lose another 144 days that don't happen again. Why can't they invent a shot that keeps time from passing? It's gonna start getting normal again, Jory. How do you call this, "fish," in Chinese? <i>This is yú.</i> - This is beautiful. - Thank you. It's time. We have to run. He just landed. I want you to keep drawing and Assand will come and finish the class, all right? I'll see you soon. - See you. - See you. Tsuen Wan Cemetery off the Number 3 Expressway. It's close to where you are now. In 15 minutes. One hundred doses. Nobody from the ministry, no police. If we see anybody else, any other vehicles, you'll never see her again. Yes? Yes, I'm fine. Please give them what they ask. I just wanna go home. Once we have the vaccine, we'll tell you where to find her. - Is it French or American? - We could not get enough from the French. It's been made here. The same formula, though. It is effective, I promise. There, be careful. Wait, where is she? - We don't know what it is. - Well, we have no choice. Where is Dr. Orantes? Now, wait, this is not what we agreed on. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I'm good. Oh, I almost forgot. - What's that? - Your vaccine. The one you took was a placebo. What? The Chinese insisted. There have been many abductions, not just here. In Russia, Mexico, all over. Government officials, scientists, or Westerners with great wealth. Mostly perpetrated by organized crime or revolutionary groups trying to extort medicines. The Chinese don't negotiate with kidnappers. It wasn't up to us. We've got a limited supply, just like everyone else. Leo. Leonora. Where are you going? Blood results came back, Mr. Krumwiede. You never had the virus. You have no antibodies. You lied. Of course that's what your labs say. Forsythia is a lie. It's a lie, and you made $4.5 million for telling it. You wanna blog about that? You are going to go away, Mr. Krumwiede, and so is all your money. I can't even imagine all the civil suits people are gonna file against you and I have a pretty good imagination. Now you wanna tell people not to get vaccinated when that's the best chance they've got. If I could throw your computer in jail, I would. Made bail. Are we done here? Evidently, there are 12 million other people as crazy as you are. You made bail. Congratulations. Cheever and wife. Congratulate Aubrey for me. I'd shake your hand, but I don't wanna set a bad example. Um, we're gonna have an official reception when we can get everybody in one place and we really hope you can be with us. Sure. So are you ready for yours? I've got mine. No, I think she's gonna wanna do these together. - I know she sprang for some champagne. - Hm. They have scheduled the hearings. We'll both be expected to testify. Right. Good luck. Head back, Anthony. There you go. Good job. I can't give him the bracelet, but at least you know he'll be safe. Yeah, beats waiting another seven months. Okay, what do you say? - Thank you. - You're welcome, Anthony. You know where this comes from, shaking hands? No. It was a way of showing a stranger you weren't carrying a weapon in the old days. - Good job. Now go finish your homework. - Okay. Yeah. You offered your empty right hand to show that you meant no harm. - Oh, I didn't know that. - I wonder if the virus does. Well, Dr. Cheever, thanks. Take care, Roger. You too. <i>You're not gonna get in trouble for this, are you?</i> Will you be quiet? My number is 287, Ellis. If we weren't married, I'd have to wait almost a year. Then it's a good thing we're married. Hold your head back. I don't wanna give them another reason to go after you. Will you please be quiet and hold your head back? Okay, go. - Good. - Mm. And go. Good. All right.

Hi, I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous. I may just be a small town FBI-agent, slash single mother. But I'm still tough.and sexy. Well, Miss Normous. Shall we shag now or shag later? Oh Austin.behave. Hey Powers! You better watch your freaking self. Because this is one doctor who does make house calls. Right, Mini-Me? Hey, assholes! I'm right over here, I'm Mine-Me. Come and get me! - And cut! - That's a cut everybody. So, Austin, what did you think of the opening credits? Well, I can't believe Sir Steven Spielberg, the grooviest - - film maker in history of cinema, - - is making a movie about my life. Very shagadelic baby, yeah! Having said that, I do have some thoughts. Really? My friend here thinks it's fine the way it is. Well no offense Sir Stevie, but you gotta have Mojo baby, yeah! Hit it! Ladies and Gentlemen. Sir Quincy Jones. This is where the movie get its Mojo, baby. Alright, everybody. Music video, take 2. It's Britney Spears! Oops. I did it again, baby. Welcome back Herr Doctor. How was space? Space was cool, wasn't it Mini-Me? Doctor Evil, while you were in space. I created a way for us to make huge sums of legitimate money. And still maintain the ethics in the business practices - - of an evil organization. - I have turned us into a talent agency. The Hollywood Talent Agency. - Really? By charging A-list clients 9 % rather that the traditional 10 %. We've been able to sign such stars - - such as George Clooney, - - Julia Roberts. And Leo DiCaprio. Leo! And the best part of the whole scheme is, - - we all get our own assistance. Hi, I'm Number 3. I'm really excited to be a part of the team, here in HTA. Very impressive, Number 2, - - but I finally have the perfect plan. In the 70s, there lived a Dutch metallurgical heathenish, - - by the name of Johann Van Der Smut. He loved gold so much he even lost his genitaliens in an unfortunate smelting accident. Hence the name.Goldmember. He invented a cold fusion power unit for a."Tractorbeam". "Tractorbeam" Powerful enough to pull a meteor to Earth. The meteor was called."Midas 22". It's made of solid gold.is he sleeping? Well, that's okay. I guess Mini-Me won't get any, CHOCOLATE! You want down Mini-Me? Use your words like a big boy clone. He's okay! Here's the chocolate. It's from Brugge. That's in Belgium, that's where daddy's from. Check out Mini-Me. He's gone mental on candied chocolate. It's like freakin' catnip for clothes. - Your chair, Dr. Evil. - Thank you. Thanks, scedadum, right. You know, when you have kids, I think your gonna find out that all kids are different, ey? For example: Mini-Me loves chocolate. Scotty don't! Well, I love chocolate fine. I just. Scotty don't! Oh yeah, very familiar, hang on, let me do what I do. Would you stop. How about I what? What do you. I don't even. Honestly, isn't this. How about you don't, ladies and gentlemen, Scotty don't. Dr. Evil, perhaps it's time, that you finish unveiling your plan. Yes, thank you Number 2. Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is. Scotty don't. Oh, come on, you're such a lame ass! You know what? This is causing me serious psychological harm! I don't know. Who am I? Fine. You know what? I would love some chocolate. - Here you go. - Thank you. Heel Mini-Me! Come on! You okay, Mini-Me? Did I pull too hard? I don't want to hurt you. - Dr. Evil. - Yo? What does Goldmember's plan have to do with us? Our earlier attempts of the tractorbeam went through several preparations. Preparation A through G were a complete failure. But now ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a working tractorbeam. Which we shall call "Preparation H". What? Why don't you just call it "Operation Ass-creamy", ass? I'm sorry did you want some ice-cream? Yes, I'd love some chocolate ass-cream. Perhaps later. Dr. Evil, I love your plan. Ja, Herr Doctor, it's a really good plan. Yes, Frau, on the whole, I think Preparation H fells good. What is it now? No, nothing. You know what? I agree. Preparation H does feel good. On the hole. Well, I'm glad wir sprechen sie the same lingity. Ladies and gentlemen. Using my time machine I shall travel back to 1975. Pick up Goldmember and bring him back to the future. And the best part of this plan is. No one can stop me. Not even.Austin Powers. Not so fast. You're sorrounded Dr. Evil. Shit! Dr. Evil, the world court sentences you to 400 years. Do you have anything to say? No, but I think Mini-Me does. Looks like two eggs and a hankie. The criminal genius known as, Dr. Evil and his clone - - were sentenced today at the world organization. For his efforts, Austin Powers, - - the son of England's most famous spy, Nigel Powers. Will be knighted by The Queen at Buckingham Palace. Arise, Sir Austin Powers. Thank you, Your Majesty. Your father must be very proud of you. Oh, yeah. Come on dad, stand up and take a bow. "Daddy wasn't there" Peace! I am a sexy beast. It's Austin Powers, you're so funny. Also very sexy. Can I have an autograph? Of course, your name is? Fook Mi. Oh behave, baby. Now your name is? Fook Mi. You kiss your mother with that mouth? Fook Mi, like this. Oh I see. Your name is Fook Mi. You want a drink? Yes of course, but I have private bar in the back, that you are more than welcome to use. Here you go. Fook Mi! That was fast! Fook Yu. Oh, you're going the right way for a smack-bottom and I don't care who knows it! Austin. This is my twin sister, her name, Fook Yu. Fook Yu.Fook Mi. Twins.twins Twins. Yes. We're going to see the twins. I also think Austin Powers is very sexy. We think you're very great. We make you sleepy? Well, you make me many things, but sleepy is not one of them. - We give you top secret massage. - Yes, top secret massage, baby! Sorry about that, I swear to God, that never happens. Yes, hold on a tick. Okay, now where were we, baby? Ah, Austin. I'm sorry to interrupt. Twins, Basil. Twins. Austin, it's your father. - What? - He's been kidnapped. Very heavy, man. Oh, so that's why my father wasn't at the knighting ceremony. Well, no actually. He was kidnapped after you were knighted. He was last seen on his yatch. Oh, yes. The "HMS Shag-at-sea". - Exactly, just take a look. Gentlemen fall in. Austin, these men were signed to guard you father. Okay, chaps, chins up, trousers down. I think we may have found a clue. Gold blimey! All your privates have had their privates painted gold. How bizarre. Imagine, guilded tally-wackers, golden wedding-tackle, fourteen-carat trousers snakes. - That's enough. - Okay. Basil, there is only one person in the world, - - who truly understand the psychology of a mad man. - Dr. Evil. - Dr. Evil. I've been expecting you, Mr. Powers. My father is missing. Yes, I've heard. How ironic. You finally caught me, yet now you need me more that ever. But then again, you've always needed me, haven't you Mr. Powers? Remember when I told you, we are not so different you and I? We are not so different you and I. - See, I did say that. - Very clever. Now who has my father? Oh, oh.someone have some daddy issues. Nothing could be my father from the truth. - You said my father. - No, I didn't. Didn't, did not. For me this is a dad issue. Daddy love me. It seems the knighting ceremony wasn't the only time your. - - daddy let you down. Remember that day at the academy? Think! It was graduation. Yeah, baby, yeah. Do I make you horny, baby? That, that's the spot. Right there. Have you ever heard of knocking, man? - Right! - We were just getting started. Don't forget, Mr. Powers, may tell you about the brief oral exam. When I have the bit, it's mostly oral, and not too.brief, baby. You know, brief and oral exam. It looks like Master Evil is the top-contender for this year's International Man of Mystery. He's number one in the class. Hey, everybody, I'm Number 1. Hello, I'm Number 2. Nice to meet you Number 2. But, now I'm going to be named this year's International Man of Mystery. Who throws a cup cake? Honestly? And now it's time for award of greatest honour. This year's International Man of Mystery is. - Austin Powers! - Well done Austin. It has always been my dream to win this award just like my dad. Glad he could be here. Stand up, dad. Take a bow. Dad? I had the best grades in the class, and I didn't get diddly squat. - Here we go. - Tell me Mr. Powers. What did you find on those sailors? A golden surprise? Perhaps? How did.yes.all the sailors had their meat and two vege painted gold. Yes, it's the distinctive calling card of a criminal master mind. The abli named. Goldmember. How can I find this Goldmember? Quid pro quo, Mr Powers. Yes, squid pro row. I'll give you Goldmember. You give me a transfer to a regular prison. So that I could be with my beloved Mini-Me. Okay. I'll get you a transfer to a regular prison. Now where's Goldmember? Not where Mr. Powers, - - but when. 1975 'Studio 69' Disco. New York City. Corner 69 and 8th. You go now, Mr. Powers. Fly fly.

You see Mr. Powers. I love gold. The look of it, the taste of it, the smell of it, the texture. I love gold so much - - that I even lost my genitalier - - in an unfortunate smelting accident. Hence the name.Goldmember. We're both swingers, you see? You have a toite body. Yesh, I see that from your toite bands. Yesh, you are toite like a toiger! Would you like a shmoke and a pancake?

Oh, he just wants to make you proud, Herr Doctor. After all it's hard on the boy not having a father. You know. First you were frozen, then you were in space, now you're in jail. Don't tell me he feels neglected. I was adopted by freakin' Belgians. You were adopted? I never met my birth parents. There was a car accident. I'm told that it was a beautiful Belgium day. The smell of waffles and brussels sprout filled the summer air.until. My birthmother was incinerated. I only survived because of her smoking carcass - - formed a protective coocoon of slaughtered human effluence. A Belgium man and his 15-year old love slave with wet feet - - was looting the accident scene, they come across a bloodsoaked baby.moi! They raised me to be evil. You know, that old chestnut. Ja. But nothing compares to this. Being inside the belly of the beast, night after night all alone. Daddy's all pant up, let's freak. Times up! Visitings hours are over. Get to the line. Cuffs up!

You got mail. So, what does this thing do? Well, it's called the Internet. It complete revolutionize the way we live and access vital information. For example, have a look at this. - Now that's vital information! - I know it's amazing. - Oh, Basil, what's happening, baby? - A lot is happening Foxxy. Dr. Evil has escaped. The good news is one of our agents has managed to infiltrate Dr. Evil's organization. Excellent, Basil we have been tried for years, to get a mole inside Dr. Evil's lair. - We now have that mole. - Yes. Ah, and here he is. So, you're the. Mo.mo.mo. Most.most.most excellent agent we've ever seen. Yes, the most excellent agent we've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. Now I wasn't able to get the exact location. But I did learn that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair outside Tokyo, Japan. By the way I realize that I have a large mole on my face. Where? What? Where's that mole? I didn't see one. I also realize the ironi, that I am myself.a mole. No one would make that connection. Anyway.well done, old chap. Jolly good work. Nice to mole you.meet you! - Nice to meet you, Mole! Don't say mole. - Stop! - I said mole. - Stop! - Bye - Mole! Mole! Mole! Oh, shut up! Moley, moley, moley, moley, moley! Up periscope. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to my new submarine lair.

We've been designing a "tractorbeam". Code name Preparation H. It's powerful enough to pull the meteor."Midas 22". Into a collision course with the Earth, - - upon entering the atmosphere the hot ball of magma. Will strike and melt the polar icecaps, causing a global flood. But enough of my technical mumbo-jumbo. Allow me to demonstrate. Lower the globe. Lower the globe! Av, av. Scheisse. Well, congratulations numb nuts. - - you've succeeded in turning me into a frickin' Jack in the box! Get it off.

Nigel Powers, meet.Mini-Me. Oh, blimey. I though I smelled cabbage. Take hime away! Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoo-hoo gold? It's kindda my thing, you know? How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard! Attention henchmen. It's health week. Don't forget your physical. Dr. Evil's orders. You know, I think it's a shame the way they treat you. Just because you're one-eight their size. Doesn't mean you deserve one-eight of their respect. Mini fella. I'm.I'm curious. Is everything in proportion. You know your bobby dangler, - your general, two colonels. Your giggle stick, master of ceremonies. Yeah, don't be shy, let's have a look. My word! You're a tripod. What do you feed that thing? It's like a baby's arm holding an apple. The good news is. If you ever get tired. You can use it as a kick-stand. I think we both know who the real brain is behind this operation. Tokyo, a go go, baby, yeah! What's kicking, Basil? A lot's kicking, Foxxy. Austin? One of Dr. Evil's henchmen has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena. - See there immediately. - Thanks, Basil. Ah, Jesus Christ, this diaper is making my nuts rub together. It's gonna start a fire! That's Fat Bastard! Do you know what my favorite Helen Hunt movie is? TWISTER! - That's not right. - Sure ain't. Are we done here? I've gotta take a crap. Wait a tic. Something doesn't smell right. And I think it's Fat Bastard. You okay, Austin? Sound as a pound, love. I didn't have any corn! Hey diaper-lady! Here's my diaper.

You know curbs are the enemy. Oh.who's your friend? Oh, I liked to have a go with that filly. Do you find me sexy? Look at my titties! Shut your mouth!

Prepare for the ultimate wire-fighting manoeuvre! I just hope my wire-fighting team is ready! - Cranky! - Oh, great, isn't this magical? One of my wires broke. Your under arrest, sugar! Okay, Fat Bastard, who's the Japanese cat you make a exchange with? All right. His name is Roboto. He owns Roboto Industries. He's designing some contraption for Dr. Evil.I don't know. - The tractorbeam. - The tractorbeam. That's it! Listen, do you honestly think that crime can pay? Well, to be honest with you, I've been trying to go legit. I really take my sumo wrestling seriously, you know. But when you are an overweight child. In this society that demands perfection. Like your sense of right, wrong, fair and unfair. We'll always be tragically scud. Did you just soil yourself? Maybe. It did sound a little wet, didn't it, right in the end, uhh. Let's have a smell, alright. Wafting, wafting. Well, everyone likes there own brand, don't they? This is magic! Alright, analysis. Smells like carrots and throw up. That could gag a maggot! Smells like hot, sick arse and a dead carcass. Even stink would say that that stinks! You know when you go to the apartment building, - - and you smell others people's cookin' on each floor, - - and you go: "What are they cookin'". That, plus crap! - Hey pa! - Hey Scotty! How you been sport. I got you a present. Really? Open the tank. Open the tank! Are those sharks with laserbeams attached to their heads? Cool! You mean I actually have fricken' sharks with fricken' laser beams attached to their fricken' heads? You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for. I love you, dad. I love you, son. Starting moment. Scotty! Come here. Pop a squat, right next to daddy! Mini-Me, move down the bench. There's a power struggle. Scotty's on fire! Alright, it's getting crowded in here. Everyone out, everyone out, come on! Not you, Scotty. Not you, Number 2. Not you, Frau. Not you, Goldmember. Not you guys back there. Not you henchman holding wrench. Not you henchman arbitrarily turning knobs making it seam like your doing something. This is uncomfortable! The tiny one can't take a hint. He doesn't understand, He's small. Hello Foxxy. Austin. We've comfirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate. He was hired by Dr. Evil to contruct Preparation H. So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember's tractorbeam. Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember. Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father. - You speak Japanese? - A little. Well you might be a cunning linguist, but I'm a master debator. I'm looking for my father. He was kidnapped. Please eat what? Wait. He said: "Please eat some shitake mushrooms." Tell me. What do you know about.s.my father's where.about.s. You're ass is happy? No! He said: "Your assignment is an unhappy one". Nice potty-mouth, dirtbag. Yes. Quite off topic, thank you very much. Why don't I just speak in English? That would be a good idea, now wouldn't it? That way I wouldn't miss-read the subtitles - - making you it seem like you're saying that are dirty. I'm sorry to hear about your father. But I can't help you. Please excuse me. I have another appointment. By the way. Mr. Roboto is lying to us. Tell me something I don't know. I open-mouth kissed a horse once. - Say-what? - That's something you don't know. My spider-senses tells me that my father is still in this building. You keep a look out. I'm gonna try to sneak in. Sha-zam! Come on, sugar. There is Goldmember and Roboto. Yesh. Very impressive put Preparation H into my stooping transporten. You need this to tone the tractorbeam. It's a gold key. Smarty pants. Let's spread out. Hands up, Goldmember! It's payback time. Sure you can kill me. But then, what happens to Austin Powers' fassia? Dad! Yesh! And now he's going to have an unfortunate smelting accident. Don't worry dad! I'm here to rescue you. May I point out, that last time around you fell into to an obvious trap. Now your're trying to save me instead of stopping Goldmember. Please, I'm not gonna let Goldmember get away! Austin, Goldmember is getting away. Hello, hello, aren't you gonna introduce us Austin? Foxxy, this is. Powers. Nigel Powers. Is that Eau de Fleuratia your wearing? Yes, it is. That's how a woman should smell. Especially one as beautiful as you. My my.even in the face of danger you live up to your reputation. Get on with it! I got an idea. Your spycar is a mini. It's not the size mate. It's how you use it. You know I would have found my way out, very well. What? I saved your life! Listen. Should have been doing your job! Oh, your welcome, mate. Shut up and turn around, please! Run! It's Godzilla! It looks like Godzilla. But due to International Copyright Laws.it's not. Still we should run, like it is Godzilla! Though it isn't. There is Goldmember. Greater-greater one-niner, this is Goldie-van. Over. 10-4 there, Goldie-van this is Rubber-ducky, what's your ten-twenty? Over. I've got Preparation H in rear and smoke in the barrel of my backdoor. Viva las convoy. Over. Yee-haa. Copy that you son-of-a-bitch powder of monkeynuts. Open wide there Rubber-ducky, I'm entering your mouth now. Over. Great, Goldmember got away. Now what? I think it's obvious, we should take Dr. Evil's lair by force. - You can be my backup, son. - Backup? Well that's fairly condescending. Do you think Dr. Evil's is gonna expect an attack? We should infiltrate his lair. It's aint my first rodeo, cowboy. We need commandos, scuba.gadgets for god-sake. Well, I don't like to use gadgets. Outside the bedroom, I thank you. You know. I think being frozen, damaged your brain. Really? And how would you know? This is the most time we ever spent together, since.ever! What are you saying, son? What boy learned to drive a car with machineguns on it? Or had a helicopter you could fit in a nutsack? What about you Swedish nanny, Helga? Oh, yes, Helga! Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking. She stayed on, until you were 24. We were mates you and I. I didn't need a friend. I needed a father. You know I have risked my life trying to save you. And you still don't give me any respect. Respect? Come on. If you got an issue, here's your tissue. That is not funny. Well, I suppose we better go our seperate ways then? Fine. Fine. So. I've been assigned to welcome you to the Ministry of Defense. I have a letter from my director personally thanking you for switching sides. I.can't wait to inform Austin of your defection. Oh. Hello Basil. Yes, Austin should be here any second. Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now. Assasin! Try to kill me will ya? Oh. You wanna be friends, huh? Wait a tick. I'm not falling for that again! But, at least he didn't mention it. Yes, I realize he can't talk. Listen I think Dr. Evil treated him badly. And that's why he has decided to help us. Come back here, you little bugger. Oh, yes. I'm sure Austin and Mini-Me, will get along famously. I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini-Me in my watch. Come here you bugger, I got ya. Oh, I think he and Austin will be united - - in their commitment to the mission of stopping Dr. Evil. Austin. There you are. I have come to tell you the good news. Mini-Me has. - switched sides. Sorry about that, old chap. Welcome aboard. My mole-stake. What was that? Listen. Just get it out of you system. - No I'm fine. - I insist. We could work together better if you just. Mole! Bloody mole! We are not supposed to talk about the bloody mole, - - but there's a bloody mole winking me in the face! I'm gonna chop it off, and cut it off. And make some guacamole! - Better? - Yeah. So you decided to join us, huh, Mini-Me? And welcome to the good side, my mini-brother. And thank you for the map for Dr. Evil's sub. What's this? It says: "Dr. Evil's tractorbeam is now complete" - - "there is not much time. Dr. Evil must pay!" "You are so beautiful." "Are you a clone of an angel?" That is so sweet! But no my mini-man, I'm not. "Are you sure you don't have a little clone in you?" Yeah I'm sure. "Would you like to.?" Holy bugger! That is so not funny. Okay, everyone prepare to dive. This spycar is also a submarine. Get me the World Organization. What is it, Dr. Evil? Gentlemen. In a matter of hours a meteor will crash into Earth causing a global flood. That is of course unless you pay me. 1 billion-gezillion-fefillion.- - million.yen. I think you're bluffing. Well perhaps you would like a demonstration? Number 2 the key, please. Sir, Dr. Evil is not bluffing. One of our satellites is falling out of orbit. Which one? It's the one that looks like a pair of. Melons! Big juicy melons! Are they nice and ferm? Well, what do you think? Look at that! It looks like a set of giant. Hey, A and N you're late. How're we doin.. Go Titans! Check it out. Those remind me of. Boobs! Boobs, Ozzy? These film makers is just *BEEP* boobs! What do you mean, dad? Well they use the same *BEEP* jokes, as they did in the last Austin Powers movie. What *BEEP* joke? You know the *BEEP* joke about the long smooth rocket that looks likes some guy's. Johnson! - Yes, sir? - Any sign of that satellite? No, sir. It's gone. Gentlemen, you have my demands, peace out! Cool, baby. You look very switched on. Thank you, Austin. No Mini-Me! Off! Bad! No humping! Dr. Evil. In light of success of the device. It is japanese custom that I recieve a bonus. A bonus? That's good. Yeah. Throw me a freakin' bonus here! I haven't laughed that hard since I was a little girl, thank you! Oh, you're nok joking. No! In fact if you don't give me the bonus. - Hey guys! - Hey Scotty, how are you, sport? - Why don't you let me take care of this? - Okay. That's the evil laugh. Scotty! Scotty! Scotty. Take it down a notch. It's creepin' a bit. Let's go. We will need a disguise. There's only one uniform. One of us has to go, on the other one's shoulders. Hey there buddy how's it going? Good to see, ya. Yeah, yeah.hi! Hello. You alright? Yes it's a good hat. Very good hat. Come on Mini-Me, let's go. Hold it right there, mister. Did you really think that you could get away with this? I did actually, yes. Every new recruit must have a physical. Now get in here sailor. I'm going to need an urine sample. Okay. Okay, then. Hello. And here we go. - Terrific. - Yes. Alright sailor. Go behind that screen and strip down to your skippies. Alright then, I'll just go to that screen. Which is over there. Right behind that screen. Come on, hurry the map. Okay, what's on the map. I'm going to need an urine sample. Which way to the main chamber? Okay. So.sure. Excuse me, doctor? It's difficult in public, isn't it? Mini-Me, our shadows, we're casting a shadow. What's wrong, sailor? You should check that guy out! What the hell is going on here? Hands up. You heard me, I said hands up! Both of you! Come with me! Mini-Me, the map. Go! Okay, you got me. Are you alright, little man? Right on! Mr. Powers. Before I kill you. Perhaps you would like to see the genius of my plan. Key, please. What the? Who? But how? Where? Looking for this? Mini-Me? Alright, everybody, drop your guns. Because Foxxy Cleopatra is in the sub. Smashing, Foxxy! Yeah! Alright, Dr. Evil. It has finally come down to this. You, me and the gun. What are you going to do now, Austin? Dad? What are you doing here? I gotta finish this off once and for all. I'm afraid you can't do that. I have to protect my son. Dad, I'm fine. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about.him. What? Dr. Evil is not your son. I am. You both are. What? It was our first.family holiday together. Just as I was finishing a case. Your mother brought the two of you to Belgium. I stopped to have a tinkle. When the car. But, my parents died in a car accident. It was no accident. Ìt was an assasination attempt. I though only Austin survived. I should have told you the truth earlier. But those Belgians, they made you so damn.evil. Of course they share border with Dutch. Very interesting story, Mr. Powers. Of course, I'm gonna have to wait until I see all the facts. Daddy! Daddy is here, Ducky. Ducky, ducky? Ducky remember, Ducky.? Dad, what's going on? What are you going to do Austin? Austin! Are you sure you can trust, Dr. Evil? He ain't heavy. He's my brother, baby, yeah! I should have told you this so long ago, son. I'm very proud of you. Can you forgive me? I forgive you dad. I'm Ducky! I'm Ducky! Oh, come on! I mean first I'm not evil enough for you. And now you're gonna turn good? Listen, Scott. You can spend your whole life - - trying to win your parents acceptance. Believe me! But at the end of the day you just gotta do it for yourself, baby. Hey, Austin. What? I hate you. I hate you! I hate you! I don't even know you, but I hate you too. And I especially hate you! You'll pay. You'll all pay! I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool runs like a girl. Not so fast, smarty pants! Dr. Evil! You might not want to destroy the world. But I do! Preparation H goes ahead as planned. I got to flood the Earth! Think again, Goldmember. Huh, Foxxy Cleopatra. It's a shame I had to kill your partner. - Too bad for you. - Too bad for me? How about too bad for you? Oh no! Luckily I keep a spare. Look everyone! My winky was a key! Oh dear, bloody Dutchman. Foxxy, I'm coming! Don't do anything stupid or the shooting begins. Austin, take Ducky I'll stay here and be your backup. Ducky, what do we do? I'm not really a "hands-on-evil-genius". Think you were always the smart one. I could re-write the output capacity to the tractorbeam - - from one of the conduit boxes up there. Come on, let's go. Yesh! The shooting begins. Let me shoot! You know, Dr. Evil. I used to think you were crazy. I know. But now I can see your nuts. I thank you. Hurry! Fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia. Fassia can you here me? Fassia, fassia. Well done, Austin! You saved the world again. Thank you. Austin, you did it. We did it! Yeah, baby! No? Just trying it on. Goldmember, you're under arrest, sugar. Hey assholes! Do I have time for a last smoke and a pancake or what? I'm from Holland! Isn't that wierd? Yes, well done! Hey Powers! Fat Bastard? But you are not fat anymore. I'm on the subway diet. I've lost a 180 pounds. Congratulations, baby. Thank you. I do have a little bit of excess skin though. But unfortunately my neck does look like a vagina. Austin. Thank you, for eveything. Sha-zam! I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers. MORE TO COME. Well they are using the same *BEEP* joke - - as they used in the last Austin Powers film.movie.oh I'm sorry. Well they are using the.the.what. Well they are using the same joke, as they. W.what do you mean? Boobs, Ozzy? Stop. Oh, don't start this Kelly, don't you worry about. On the mark! On the mark? I don't like that noise I'm getting all turned on. My testeron is going dancing. Get off me! Is.is it true what they say about you? Kickstand? Really? Can I give you my cellphone number? Please?

Look I'm not going to blow the 3 asian wars for close. With all do respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead orientals. - They care about Ken Castle. - Can I hear it from Gina, please? Okay, Bob. Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked exactly one media appearance state, and that was Walter's last interview before she died, that would be 9 fucking years ago! Stop menstruating and just tell me whether we fucking have it? We fucking, have it. Good! Okay, focus. Let's get lunch. Iranian, sushi or mexican? Burger chili fried? I could eat a burger. We live in society. We visit society. I mean, which one, which one is more real? Really? I mean, which one is really real? You know what I mean? <i>You're watching Gina Parker Smith, alive!</i> <i>World link tonight exclusive!</i> This motherfucker is off the charts. You realize he could buy the network. Yeah, why would he? The son of a bitch pulls 650 millions pay-per-views for one single broadcast. Going live in. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. First, there was "Society". The ultimate sim environment, where players don't control virtual animated characters, but actual, living, breathing human beings. They walked them, they talked them, they juiced them, they rocked them. Rickidy dickidy doo. We had that on t-shirts back on 2010. The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle. "Who is Ken Castle?" "Society" took the world by storm, becoming the number one guilty pleasure of billions. You can get paid to be controlled, or you can pay to control. And generating one of the world's largest private fortunes, surpassing Bill Gates practically, over night. Nine months ago, Castle availed a new simulation. One that would take gaming into new heights of thrilling excess. and controversy. SLAYERS Slayers, if "Society" let us live through others, "Slayers" could let us die through others. Slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being, in full scale kill or be killed combat. And when we say "flesh and blood" We mean, flesh. and blood. - Slayers. - Slayers! Why isn't it murder? Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate. Each one offered the chance to participate as an alternative to their sentences. If you stay alive for 30 sessions, you can get set free. That's not a bad goddamn deal. And has any of these men or women have actually survived long enough to be set free? Well I remind the audience that Slayers was put together with a full cooperation and approval, of the United States Federal government. That the revenue that produces. is responsible for funding our entire prison system. keeping the bad guys behind bars. And that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the american public. In an election tainted by a suspected digital fraud. Let's talk about the so called "genericons". Sent into the Slayers environment, With a set of pre programmed actions, with no one controlling them, and no way to react, their chances of survival next to nil? There's plenty of men and women in prison who can never cut it to Slayers shouldn't they be given the same chance, roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides they only need to survive one session. Right. So Mr. Castle, how the hell does it work? It begins with a single nano cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain. This cell can replicate, replacing the cells around it with perfect copies. And these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore nano plus cortex, equals a "nanex". Is it true, that every human that undergoes this procedure, will have a distinct "ip" address, like a mobile device. - or a notebook computer? - Similar, yes. But control is strictly localized with the parameters of our gaming environment. You take "Society" for instance. Once our cast member has left the workplace they're completely free, from the control and monitoring of their player. Oh well that's a relief! For some, maybe. For some. Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't mind a bit of controlling? Someone else making all the decisions for you? No tough choices, no responsibilities? - Think about it. - We will, Mr. Castle. We will! <i>The Gina Parker Smith Show! Sponsored by.</i> <i>SLAYERS</i> Good little talk? Oh, shit! My pleasure! Can I just tell you, I cannot wait until the next Slayers, I mean, Kable has been unbelievable! His arms are just so. well I know they're terrible! What the hell is that? Ken Castle wants you to believe that we are living in a better, safer world. - His a liar! When mind controlling his Slayers. - Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is. We will all be his dogs if we allowed this evolution to continue. That's a goddamn hoot! This is nuts, it's like the signal is generating simultaneously from six countries. Reroute to the backup servers please, now. Now! Ah, Mr.Castle, we can't stop every virus that sneaks in. You might want to let my home boys take a look at your firewall. We're on it. They'll be off the air momentarily. So sorry. - What about you sugar woman, mind if breach your firewall one of these days? - You bad! He's good! Hit him! Fuck him up Get down! Get the fuck down! Kable! My name is Tillman. Yeah yeah. Tillsman, Tillsman They said your name was Tillsman. You're just sitting, eh?. Sitting and looking, just looking and sitting. Just like me, man.

Anybody but you, right? 27 battles, huh? Until you go. Nobody has ever done it. No man has ever come that close. No one has even got 10 games without getting their brain shot. anybody but Kable. Kable, because you're sitting and looking, huh man? You're gotta plan in your head, you gotta mission, you never break, you never snap, you never say shit either, but you take care of your business, don't you?

Now that we have your attention, here's an offer that you can't refuse. - Here we go. - 50 million euros. for control of Kable. instant transfer to the account of your choice. Kable is not for sale, thank you. Baby, make a hundred. Spin the reel! What the fuck? If you want to talk to Kable, we can show you how. Look at it. The new face of Slayers. Pure, crystalized horror, two stories high and bathed in bloody red. He is what they want. They love Kable. They do now, but when they watch their hero die right in front of their eye balls. so sharp and vivid. if feels like it could've reach out and touch the wet flesh. They're going to change their point of view Be seduced by the power. The violence, the dominance. Is human nature. Kable made it to 28 battles, every player in the game is going to take him out. Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier, he's a tactical killing computer. His only vulnerability is the nanex itself. The. delay between Simon's commands and Kable's ability to execute. So why should this one be any different? Who controls him? No one. Get it out of me! What the hell happened to this one? Looks like he escaped. Hi girls. Back to your exercise. That's Hackman, Hackman, Hackman, knack man. They say he killed a whole bunch of people, man. Killed himself all kinds of people. And then one day, he just walks up and turns himself in. like he wants to be inside or some crazy shit like that. You know what I'm saying? So it's going to be all kinds of Slayers, man. As long as you got motherfuckers like that running around killing. Kable! Let's go! Upgrades, come on. Why don't you upgrade a brother man? Why don't you shut the fuck up?! Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Fucking, shut the fuck up. - Who wimps? - What? Who wimps, the player or the slayer? Someone, somewhere else is the eye. It's tripped out, man. Sometimes, they take over. Completely, they. move you around like a robot. - But that don't work so good. - Why? The delay. Yeah the ping. They talk about that. About how long it takes the Slayer to respond to the command. Whatever they call it, the slice of a second out there, is the difference between living and dying. When that trigger pulls. it's just me. Hey, Kable. Look. I just killed someone. This is the blood. Look. He's back here. Wanna see? No your head ain't working straight. I'm going to kill you too, on sunday. Yeah, probably. That's why they put me here. I got no strings. I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. They got strings, but you can see, there are no strings on me. You go two whores, Kable. - What the fuck you said? - Outside. I'm sorry, I met your pretty girls. So you want to get back to them. But I'm going to visit them first. Alright. Kable. Kable. Kable, dude. It's me. It's me. Who? Simon, I'm playing you. - How come I can hear you? - Well it's mud. Gamers can't talk to cons. I know. It's fucking unbelievable. This is amazing. Cool yeah? No it's not cool. Pay attention to the fucking game! Okay, okay. I got it, I got it. What are you, 12? I'm 17 actually, thank you. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yeat? Cause I'm a badass, motherfucker. Shit! Freek, you shouldn't be here. - Gibs. - What? Like giblets. Chunks. Pieces. Pieces everywhere. These are real humans fucker. Death row, psychos. so what? They had it coming anyway, right? I guess that goes for me too. Yeah, but you're different. Different, how? I don't know, because you're in my side. Damn new area. Think about it Kable, all the shit we've been through together, what an epic run, man. It's gonna suck to see it end. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh yeah, I get that for you is different. This way. - There's nothing there. - Trust me, kid. It's restricted area. It's beyond the border of the game I couldn't put you there if I tried. Warning. Access denied. Very well. Shit. Bye, Kable. Come on. This kid will get me killed. Dude I'm right here, man. I can hear you. Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it or why, but I was supposed to die tonight. Lucky for us, I can beat them. but not with you controlling me. What the hell are you talking about? Turn me lose, kid. You want to win? Turn me lose. Find a way. Bastard. So Ms Roth. Says here you're applying for custody of your daughter? Delia, her name is Delia. Spouse incarcerated, left without the possibility of parol. - You use your maiden name? - huh-huh. My husband, is. it's not entirely true regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon. Ms. Roth, your husband was charged and. charged and convicted of first degree murder, I can't hardly consider his release, or if it happened at all.. I don't think it would be a good thing. So it's says you're an actor? I don't know that I've seen you in anything. I work in "Society". It's a job. Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed, the new family is very wealthy, she won't have to work for anything. Now I can understand that you love your daughter. Probably very much. But do you really think she would be better off. with. people like you? Yes, I do. I'm her mother. We will give your application on the consideration of merits. <b>Body armor purchased</b> Do you like the software? Software? The walkie talkie, player. No shit. You're the guy from the TV, the Humanz. That's right, baby. You think about what the brother said? What brother do you refer, brother? Kable wants the freedom to ass kick. Do shit his way. - Are you going to give it to him? - You were listening? We see and hear everything. everything that goes on inside that so called game. Alright then, Kable said we got lucky. They were gunning for us. What's that all about? Kable got a past, he knows things. Things you don't even know. - What things? - Things that Castle is afraid of. As long as you boy stays on the him inside, Castle knows he can keep him quiet. But if he ever got out. Castle would never let that happen. There's one battle left, I think I can handle my own business, thank you very much. You're not hearing me. This is not something you can control. They're gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world, and then what? You're just another poor little rich honky. No cable, no pussy, no shit. Look man, this. this is too heavy. I don't even know what the hell are you talking about. - I just play games, man. Games. - That's right. It is a game. You want to win, don't you? Yeah, I intent to. Then you need to cut your strings puppet master. Imagine a slave that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? That would be cheating. A mod. That's all it would be. You know why? Because the game's got to evolve. - You feel me? - I do. I do feel you my, giant brother. Well then, let's rock baby. Tillman. he knows you talked to him. Your player. - Who are you? - A friend. I don't have any. Listen to me. Simon is going to give you what you want. What you asked him for. - How do you know that? - I know something else. Whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it. - We'll see. - No, you have to escape. Your wife and your daughter need you, Tillman. If you want to get out and see the people in the picture. you will have to find another way. I need you to get me something. What? Tell me. Drunk. <i>Kable's Last Stand</i> What do you go there? Kable, what the hell is that? Put it down. Put it down! Fuck face! Throw the bottle in the trash! Oh, I see it was a great idea turning you lose. - What happened? - You happened! You wanted control, you got it. What's the matter with you, Kable? Kill something! This is unbelievable. Kable, listen. This is the last game you're going to end up dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole. if you don't pull your balls together, man! Damn it! Kable, what the hell are you doing? Aw, what the hell? That's just gross, bro. Go, go, go, go! I'm not your fucking cheerleader! Motherfucker! Kable, please, please, I beg you, get back in the game. You're screwing my ass, Kable. This is a restricted area. Return to the battle zone. RESTRICTED I'm dead. <i>Sweet dreams are made of these</i> <i>Who am I to disagree?</i> <i>Travel the world and the seven seas</i> <i>Everybody's looking for something</i> <i>Some of them want to use you</i> <i>Some of them want to get used by you</i> <i>Some of them want to abuse you</i> <i>Some of them want to be abused</i> PLEASE STAND BY What the fuck just happened? Initial reports are that Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon. next to Ken Castle himself, is officially listed as fragged. Just one session away from being the first Slayer ever. to win a full pardon and release. And in NetCast, fledged by technical difficulties and dead spots the report could not be confirmed, however Kable, born John Tillman of Albany, New York and convicted of murder just 4 years ago, has been removed from Slayers rosters and upcoming events listings. His player, gaming mega star, Simon Silverton, could not be reached for comment. Do you have a question? Tillman left her away for the outside, right? - Tillman, yeah. - Find her. <i>Blink, activated.</i> She's not home. But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough and trust me. - You don't want to meet them. - Who are you? You asked me that once before - Your voice. - You know, you should really come with me. Like now! See that's why you're a fool! That's what I'm talking about! Could you stop Come one man, that's why it's a game of deception, man! That's bullshit, man! You know that's bullshit! So you're the ones who broke me out? - We only freed your mind. - And your ass follows. Holly shit. You made it! You're really here. Kable. You're great. - You got questions. - A few. So she took my blood. Why? The nanex. It modifies the actual cell structure of your brain. We can crack it, but it's not one size fits all, we need your DNA so that we can generate costume code. Alright, then why me? Because Castle is afraid of you man. It ain't just a game, Tillman. Every day there's more people stepping forward. Want to be a part of Castle's world, throwing away everything that means to be human. Right now is the desperate ones. Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor. The ones that fell through the cracks. The federal prison system is growing out of control. Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA, then Castle rides in on a white horse Says he has a plan to bail us all out and we just fall in line? The healthcare system is collapsing. And this time he's pushing for total control over genetic diseases. Birth defect is no longer an issue. All we have to do is exchange our cells for the ones he wants to give us. Promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet. - Do you think people will refuse? - Fuck no. Then the next thing you know. we're all slaves. I can't help you. Tillman. We know where she is. Hi, Nika. - Oh hi. Rick Rape, right? - Rick Rape, right? I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore. That was last month. I was a bad boy. Are you still a bad boy? - Please, don't kill me. - Please, don't kill me. No. - I'll do anything. - Don't say that. Stop! Stop! Goddamn it. You, in there controlling. Let her talk! I can't she has to say what I tell her. You can hear me. I know you can. I love you. I love you too. Shut up! Don't say anything else. I'm going to find you. and I'm going to rip you to fucking pieces, do you understand me? I'm getting you out of here. I'm going to take you to some place where you can turn it off, the program. Hi Kable. Look at me bitch! Anybody in there? Go on. Do it. What the fuck do we do? I can get you out of here. Oh shit! I can't believe it's you! This is. listen, Tillman, you can trust me, I swear. If not. you're dead! Okay. Faster! Faster! I guess you remember that day, huh? You just gotten Kable through his 10th consecutive session alive. No one ever thought an icon could last that long. Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King player. Good times. Sure, on the outside. Now look at these. That's what it's like on the inside. Wonder how long you would last on the other side of the screen? You know, Simon. you being held here today. suspected of aiding an escape of a convicted murder from a maximum security penitentiary. The charges are beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized. Forensics are depicting the content as we speak. Your internet activity over the last 10 years, is being scrutinized and catalogued. In minute. vivid detail. In addition, your father's bank accounts have been frozen, pending further investigation. After all, it was essentially his money that funded Mr. Tillman's escape. Now I need you to tell me. everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon. Anybody you talked to, everything you saw, everything you did. And I need you to tell me that right now. Yeah, huh. I'm going to need something too. Oh really? And what might that be? Could you guys do a sandwich like. peanut butter, or almond butter, walnut butter. huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter.. pretty much any kind of. you know, nut butter with some grape jelly. Pistachio butter. - They make that? - It's awesome. Now what? Now we just put the DNA into the suit, light it up, extract it. a few modifying sequences into the code and we're good to go. - It's an anti-spyware program. - Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per say, but. we can disable their ability to transmit and receive. Fuck that. I'll make you cut it out me. That would be like cutting out a part of your brain. The nanex cells replace the cells, they replicate. They become you. We're going to have to keep her sedated until we kill the link. Otherwise she will be broadcasting everything she sees and hears, 30 minutes. You give us a robot. we give you back a super hot female. Tillman! We need to talk. - So talk. - Come on. They tested on soldiers. The first volunteer was the corporate Travis Scotch a friend of yours, I believe. And the second, it was you. The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell. The new tissue would never break down, never deteriorate. A new era in human longevity, that's what they told us. 9 weeks later Scotch was dead. and you were serving life at maximum. Castle's project was shut down. But the same technology resurfaced within a year in a game. Castle called it "Society". Tillman, listen man, whatever happened in that project, is something Castle wanted buried. We need that shit man. What you saw, what you know. I don't know what to tell you. You gotta tell me shit. I want you to show me. Okay, we're ready to rock. We're ready to break the link in. 3. 2. 1. Who's there? What are you doing here? - Who are you? - Tech support. SOCIETY LINK FAILURE - What are we looking at? - His memories. Translating into raw audiovisual data. I read something about this. But that tech is not supposed to be available for another decade. They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy in 18 months. Son of a bitch! John Tillman. Man I never thought I would be so happy to see your ugly face. Scotch. <i>Is it me or is this place fucked?</i> <i>They got me hooked up to computers 5 hours a day.</i> Feed me vitamins, and pills, and god knows what giving me injections, taking and giving me blood. These nurses are whipping my ass. and there are male nurses to bro! I can't believe I let you talk me in to this. And I'm having these, like, blackouts. and is scaring the shit out of me. I don't even know how long I've been here Hey man. <i>Are they letting you out already, you son of a bitch?</i> I'm not getting out. Okay. Johnny. Are you good? I'm fine. Man you don't look fine. I'm sorry. Yeah that's okay. It's not like you ever been that good in the first place. What's the gun for, John? What's happening? Really you're scaring me man. What's the gun for? I can't st. I can't stop. Stop what? What did they do to you man? John, stop it! You're scaring me now. Stop it. Sorry Scotch, I. John, no! Don't! Stop! Not the best commercial for Ken Castle. They made them do it. - Castle made them do it. - It was a test. Touching. Excuse me, media whore. This isn't just a story. The whole world is splitting down the middle. Sooner or later, everyone is going to have to take a side, even scavengers like you! It's you. I missed you, so much! You are the reason I held on. - I love you. - Where's our daughter? I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry. Nobody could. The foster parents paid good money to remain anonymous. But there's always a data trail if you know where to look. Where is she? I'm sorry, Tillman. She's with Castle. Tillman! That's all the story you're going to get. Silverton, get up. What's going on man? Looks like someone up the chain has decided you're no longer a threat. CHEATER FUCK YOU CHEATER! NANEX ACCESS DENIED We'll find him. Don't worry. We'll come to us. KABLE, THE FALLEN HERO OF SLAYER REST IN PEACE - Not bad for a video, huh? - What? The latest and greatest, I defy you to tell it from real life. could you imagine porn on this thing? <i>I've got you under my skin</i> <i>I've got you deep in the heart of me.</i> <i>So deep in my heart</i> <i>that you're really a part of me</i> <i>I've got you under my skin</i> <i>I'd tried so not to give in</i> <i>I said to myself: this affair never will go so well</i> <i>But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well</i> <i>I've got you.</i> <i>under my skin.</i> <i>I'd sacrifice anything come what might</i> <i>For the sake of havin' you near.</i> <i>In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night</i> <i>And repeats, repeats in my ear.</i> <i>Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?</i> <i>Use your mentality, wake up to reality.</i> <i>But each time that I do just the thought of you</i> <i>Makes me stop before I begin</i> <i>'Cause I've got you under my skin</i> <i>under my skin.</i> You're awesome! Castle. Kable. I don't care about you. You just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupid. My house, my rules. Come on, I want to show you something I wanted to thank you for leading me into them, the Humanzuz's cell, that is. Of course sooner or later they would be whistling my tune just like everybody else, but. Meantime, there's that little cracker program they dreamed of that got my attention. That was a genuine disuse, no doubt about it One thing even they didn't know, though, I'm wired too. I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago. But mine's different. It's built to send, to transmit, whereas every other nano-cell that I've put out there, including the ones in your head Kable, are designed to receive. I think it, you do it. We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society city. I believe your better half would fall under that category, provided they were within range of my transmitters. Very nice, Castle. So you got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you? You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. See, nano-cells are real small. A thousand times smaller than these dust particulars. You inhale it. They go to work; replicating, spreading like a virus, multiplying in exponentials. Six months time, I can have a hundred million people converted. Ditch diggers, porn stars, and presidents. Not one would be the wiser. A hundred million people who buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do. For instance. You should have let him fight for himself. Maybe you would've had a shot. - I think you're missing the point, my man. - No no, I get it. You're pulling all the strings around here. Which makes my next move pretty. Neglected to mention my smart boys reversed that crack the Humanz worked for you. Easy breezy once I had access to their drives. <i>You're mine boy.</i> Come one, let's boogey wooguey rock n' roll. I think that badass Slayer of the game don't seem like much, does he? Lucky shot Not really. I need an audience boys. No no no, you crawl. on your belly like a toad. Is this bad? I'm really bad. <i>Is this bad? I'm really bad.</i> That's sweet. Alright boys are you ready? It's time for a true test. Just like last time, remember? Yeah, you're stronger now, a little more fighting. But I think the end result will be just about the same. What the hell was that? Someone from the outside is sending him commands. We're being broadcast live. Jam the signal! Goddamn retards! We're working on it. I think it, You. fucking. do it. Look at this knife. imagine me sticking it into your gut. Think about it. make it real! Yes! - Are you okay? - Are you my daddy, Tillman? I'm your daddy. Wait. - Shut it off. - Pardon? The nanex. It's nothing to you. Just a mouse click. Set us free. Well played, Kable. JOURNEY TO SATURN No! My beer! What the hell . Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

PlayStation, see? - Way to go, Jamil. Bull's eye! - The UFO seems to be unharmed. They don't stand a chance against our deflector shield. Give me an estimate of the steering system of their pathetic vessel. - A black hole. lt's sucklng us in! - Arne, turn the wheel! Way to go, Arne! - Red alert! - Take over. l'll check the air lock. Red alert! Red alert! CONFlDENTlAL Per, would you please come wlth me? Just actlvate the jet pack, scoot over to the UFO and attach the explosives. - Have you gone mad, man? - Don't worry, Per. Thls should be a plece of cake for a seasoned astronaut llke you. Wait! l'm not an astronaut. l've never been to space before. l don't know how to rlde a jet pack! l've known that from the moment l saw you. Arne Skrydsbøl has a keen eye.

Have you never been so madly in love that it hurts just to see her? That's how l felt about Susanne. She'd just been accepted lnto the Academy. l thought, "l'm will be an astronaut, too." Just to be close to her. But l flunked all the tests. Get to the point, or l shoot you ln the head like llttle Dick Cheney. So l started cheating to impress her. Yes, l tampered with my exam papers. No Dane wlth any klnd of space slash milltary tralnlng ls fooled by a con. Yes. She was mad about me, and everythlng was just great. Then she found out l had cheated and went totally balllstlc. She sald l was a disgrace to the space program. She never understood. l didn't give a fuck about the space program. l just wanted to be with her. You actlvate the bomb on the red button. No! Oh, no! - Where's Per? - There. lt's always nlce to have a clear view, rlght, Per? Activate the jet pack, you idiot! Hell bloody! - Oh. no. - No more games. What klnd of abomlnatlon ls this? Some sort of advanced remote control. They've taken over our control system. What the fuck are you up to? Goodbye. Get us away from here! Typlcal! Per! - You are a trained astronaut, right? - We'll be a part of history forever. - You're so cool, Per! - You smell like a con man. - Per is a genuine man of the people. - Per is a fucking fraud! Susanne! Susanne . no! Per! Oh, no, lt's all my fault. Bloody hell! The autopilot ls down with a fatal error. This is a crisis situation. We'll never make it back to Earth. - What happened to Per? - He was sucked lnto the black hole. - We have to go in after him. - A suiclde mission? You'd llke that! - We have to try. - Arne, where are you? Arne, for fuck's sake! The mission always comes flrst! Per failed us. l can do nothing! - What the hell is wrong now? - We've run out of gas. Well, you'll have lt your way then. Beloved Mr. Dictator, we're enterlng the Earth's atmosphere. He was rlght. They've got enough water to keep the fleet running in 20 years.

One, two, three' four . Oh, no. Oops, Mr. Prime Minister, this is going to be expensive. We'll just cut back on the care of our senlor citizens again this year. - Mr. Maj. - Susanne. What an entrance. Our spaceshlp is lost, and an unldentified vessel is approaching. - l thlnk it's hostlle. - The Danlsh People's Party protest. There comes a time when you as a citizen of thls peaceful nation - - will be forced to perform the noble defonce mechanism, - - which we through proud generatlons have resorted to agaln and again - - and proven that we master to perfection. - Total supjection. - What? We're talking about cool cash here. lmaglne the export rights and exchange of sustainable technology. Your re-electlon is ensured slnce you can lower taxes and safoguard welfare. You can't jus do that! Leave thls to the men now, right, you sweet llttle thing? - l thlnk we've passed through it. - Never underestlmate Danish deslgn. - The atmosphere is compatible. - We're really out ln the stlcks, huh? We have to survey the area and find fuel, lf Denmark ls to be saved. Look! A llght. DENMARK HAS VlSlTORS FROM SPACE Cheers! l'm so horny. We want to cum in the ass of all your girls. Give me your big cock. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Dear Danes! Let's welcome our new allles. These fasclnatlng belngs have come to negotlate the future export of goods. Of all natlons on Earth they chose us. Because Danlsh goods are the best! lf we enter into this agreement, - - then early retlrement ls guaranteed for all further generatlons. That's not true! The aliens are hostile. They've murdered our astronauts! Well, as soon as someone makes a splendid inltlative - - that will create prosperlty, - - the leftwlnged, paranoid eco-freaks crawl out of their filthy wood works. Some people wlll always be naysayers, when it comes to progress, - - but real Danes will agree that those who try to slow progress are traltors! - You fucking communlst! - Filthy bitch! But where ls the Saturn Expedltlon then? Traltor! - Welcome to Earth. - Prepare a translator. Attention! Thls looks llke a cultural leftist art installation. Hey, there's doorbell.

You're not dead' are you? - No. - What about the UFO? - Well, it got away, didn't lt? Let's just flnd some gas and blow this hippie commune. We don't have stuff like that up here. The whole place ls wind-powered. - God Almighty! - You must help us save Earth. Earth? But that's our entlre clientele. Say, the Holy Ghost mlght be able to help you. What do we need that for?

Keep it up there, and you'll pass the Dane test the next tlme. Well, boys. e're almost home. Hello. Per, is that you? l thought you were dead. How did you find your way back? Per handled that. He turned out to be an outstanding navigator. - Susanne, has the UFO arrived? - Yes, but l've . - The invasion fleet is on its way. - The invasion fleet? Dld the dictator brlng a remote control? Of course! The dictator uses the remote control - - to log unto the operatlve system of other spacecrafts and control them. lf you could get hold of lt, we may be able to stop the entire UFO fleet. - Okay. I'll do my best. - we'll come as fast as we can. So this is where you're hldlng, rlght ln an intergalactic date. - How sweet. - Leave her alone! When the stars beckon, then big, bad Per is on his way! why do you think I picked a bunch of losers and a burned-out soldier? You're good for nothing' and that made you perfoct for my little mission. Wish l had time to chat, but I've got a planet to suck dry. Say goodbye to Susanne now. - l thought you'd done away with them. - They don't know what they're in fer. Put the pedal to the metal. Let's go! - Where did that come from? - We're dead meat, boys. We'll hlt the moon. Shlt! This is going to be one tough crash landing! Oh, no. The invaslon fleet. Why did l joln thls shitty mission? l'll never see my dear famlly again. l've lost everything for fucking Denemarci! Sandwiches, beer and crappy soccer! You can't even beat the Swedes! And silly proverbs! Who the hell llves in a house of glass? And who wants one bird in the hand? lt's a shitty nation! l have to speak to my God. - Where the heck ls Mecca? - Just face Earth. That should do it. Thls ls the perfoct place to erect your water exploltation machlne. You can't just take the water on Earth. lt belongs to all of us. - You get the Kurt Maj Drlnk instead. - But ordlnary people can't afford it. Then they'd better start saving up. A strong signal on our radars seems to indicate more incoming UFOs. lt's almost an army. - So many to bulld that machine? - My soldlers won't building anythlng. We'll have slaves do the work! Never polnt a thlng like that at other people. lt's fucklng dangerous. Hold it right there! We're on our way to Earth - - to stop an alien invasion, and we don't have time for your feollshness. Work ls progressing at a steady pace. We expect to be ready in 24 hours. - You have 12. - Danes can't work any faster. Their work ethic has deterlorated from decades of belng publlc employees. Wrong answer. You're in charge now. You've got 12 hours, understood? Start the countdown! Hey, kabob. Hey, let the grown-ups have a look. Hornbæk Beach. High soclety tlts! What's that? lt's the countdown for the end of the world. - Susanne! - Someone ran off with your girl. - Treachery on the home-front. - She's been taken hostage! At least the problem is solved. We'll nuke the platform and be heroes. - We can't! Susanne is down there. - Let me tell you something, Per! l've only had one true friend, Gerd, my second in command. During a mlssion in Basra, he was caught ln enemy crossflre. l could elther complete the mission or save Gerd. l chose Gerd. lf Gerd dled, l wouldn't have anyone left in my llfe. Nobody! lt didn't work. The mission went totally awry. Arne! Gerd was killed. 60 bullets. l was demoted from colonel to sergeant. l'd forgotten the most important rule ln the army: The mission comes first. But this is my chance to make lt right! That's not right, Arne. You went through the black hole to save me. lt wasn't qulte like that. l get your point about not nuklng anybody, but how can we stop them? Kurt Maj had a point. We are just a bunch of losers. We didn't get thls far just to end up nuklng hundreds of innocent people. Did we at any tlme have the odds in our favour? Would a bunch of losers have survived everythlng we've been through? We aren't losers. We're astronauts. We represent Denmark ln the entlre unlverse - - and Denmark doesn't nuke lnnocent people just to serve a greater cause. - l suggest we put it to the vote. - Danlsh democracy ls the thlng! All ln favour of saving Denmark ln a humane way. - Hear, hear! - Utter feollshness! - Per, do we have a plan? - No. But l know someone who might. NEW SATURN RACE - TERRORlSTS?

Pause! - Slow forward. - How about a beer? - Why, it's beer! - Of course! Yo, have a beer! They're back! - Per! - lf we have her, they won't touch us. Keep them out of the control room. Lead them up to the top deck. - But how? - Just do it. Now! The suction machlne! We have to stop it. Come on, Arne! Where ls the control room? Over here, boys. You! Get all these people as far away as posslble. - Stop your grlplng, Susanne. - Susanne! Let's spllt up. Arne and Ole, stop the engine. Jamll, come with me. You stay here and fix that door.

There is a lovely country . lt didn't penetrate you. Your photos stopped the bullet! You made it! Yo, greenhorn. Cheers! Rlght on' Susanne! Let's get out of here. We have to stop that suction machine. - What the hell does lt say? - You have to mount a translator. - You can borrow mine. - Flne, just hurry up. - What are you up to? - A nuclear mlsslle ls on lts way. - We just need to get out of here. - Susanne and Ole are still up there! The mission comes flrst. That's the way lt is. - That sounds just about right. - You could've told me where ite went. ON/OFF Why couldn't you just have read lt? - Susanne! - Per! You were so good up there! Why dldn't you just come right out and say it? l thought you were a lame smartass . Not now! There's a nuclear mlsslle on its way. Basra! Arne? l told you l only had one true frlend. l see now that's not true. l've galned two new frlends. Sometimes friends come before the mlssion. Alright, three friends then. Run, dammit, run! - Arne! - You shall not pass, you bastard! Arne! We can't get away. He's too heavy. Jamil' the gun! Bottoms up! - Rlght on, man! - Yeehaw! Hurry up! The mlsslle ls coming. Yeehaw! Fools! l have thousands of UFOs left ln the unlverse. Dld you really thlnk it would be that easy to beat me? Shit! Would a desert princess like you like to see the palm rlse at Ole's oasis? - Bloody hell, Ole! - Remember: Respect for traditions. That doesn't count when we're talking about my cousin. Do you really understand Danish if you use one of these? - Where wlll we spend our honeymoon? - We could begin with the Milky Way. And after that we'll just follow the stars. SUSANNE HAS GOT A TlGHT PUSSY l sensed that somethlng was not right with the strangers' - - so l declded to isolate them at my oil field and extermlnate them. lt was a tough battle, but my plan worked. l had them exterminated.

I was thinking the same thing. Mind reader. Darn. I seem to have left my keys in the lab. You're gonna get it. Who 's there? Come on! Stupid antenna. Invaders from Mars! Honey? HeIp! HeIp! Stop! HeIp! Don't you know better than to wander off at night aIone? What if something happened? I'm sorry, Mom. Don't you ever do that to me again. I was so scared. I thought I'd Iost you. You won't beIieve this. Something ate our TV antenna. No! I'm serious! It's not Sputnik, Iike Mr. Stutz thought. No, it's a robot! No, reaIIy, it is! And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high! And it eats metaI! Stop it! Just. . . . . .stop. I'm not-- I'm not in the mood. Come on. Let's go home. A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day in a town very much like your own. But then, suddenly, without warning atomic holocaust! But how does one survive an atomic attack? Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz? He says his boat ran into a sea monster. I heard it was sunk by a meteor. It was a metaI meteor. It ate his boat. My dad says-- It wasn't any of those. What wouId you know about it, Poindexter? Don't make me come over there. Hands over your head Keep low to the ground Time to duck and cover The bombs are coming down Duck and cover It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it onIy eats metaI. Shut up, you IittIe spaz! It's been sent by foreigners to take over the country. We shouId bomb it to smithereens before it does. 'Cause all the kids who don 't Will cease to be around Thanks for the scrap. Sorry I can't pay you more. But it's got this. . . . . .this Iarge bite out of it. That's why I'm seIIing it. It's got a Iarge bite out of it. -What couId've done this? -I toId you what. Strange invaders. Thanks for beIieving me. I reaIIy did caII the government. They're sending someone to take care of the whoIe thing. Jeez, EarI. You reaIIy are crazy. Who in the heII wouId the government send? Kent MansIey, UnexpIained Phenomena. -Marv Loach. I-- -What happened? Not sure. Sometimes the Iine'II snap if the weather is bad, sure. But for a whoIe tower to get twisted up Iike that. . . . It's got me beat. It's aImost Iike it was bitten off by some enormous beast. Enormous beast. What do you think? Escaped goriIIa? What department is that again? I'm not at Iiberty to reveaI the particuIars of my agency. . . . . .and aII that that impIies. You mean nationaI security? Let's put it this way. Once in a whiIe, things happen. . . . . .that can't be rationaIized in a conventionaI way. PeopIe wanna know the government has a response. I am that response. So were there any witnesses? WeII, sir, if you'II just foIIow me. We did find this. United States Government, huh? Guess that means something big's happening here. No, Marv. Big things happen in big pIaces. The sooner I fiII out my report, the sooner I can get back to them. Enormous beast, yeah. . . . Biggest thing here is the homecoming queen. Oh, my God! Come on, I need a witness. -It's around the corner. -Don't puII so hard. It's Iike a chomp out of the side of the car. It's Iike a bite out of a sandwich, Iike a-- What are we Iooking at here, Mr. MansIey? Something big, Marv. Something big. HeIIo! Come out! Hey, big metaI guy, I got food here for you! MetaI! Crunchy, deIicious metaI! Come and get it! So I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh? The shutoff switch. You saw me save you. So where are you from? You came from the sky, right? From up there? Don't you remember anything? Maybe it's that bump on your head. Do you taIk? You know, words? ''BIah, bIah, bIah,'' Iike that? Can you do that? WeII, you get the idea anyway. Let's see. See this? This is caIIed a rock. Rock. Good. That is a tree. Rock. Tree. Get it? That's right! My own giant robot. I am now the Iuckiest kid in America! This is unbeIievabIe. This is the greatest discovery since, I don't know, teIevision or something. I gotta teII someone. I shouId caII-- No, they'II panic. PeopIe wig out and shoot at something big Iike you. Wig out. It means crazy. You know, Iike. . . . No, no! Don't do that! That's the stuff that makes them shoot at you. Two nights ago, at approximateIy 1 ,900 hours, sat com radar. . . . . .detected an unidentified object entering Earth's atmosphere. . . . . .Iosing contact with it 2 1 /2 miIes off the coast of RockweII. Some assumed it was a meteor or a downed sateIIite. But Washington received a caII from someone. . . . . .who reported an actuaI encounter with the object. This is no meteor, gentIemen. This is something much more serious. We can't caII Ripley's Believe It Or Not because they wouIdn't beIieve it. And. . . . It's getting dark. And if I don't get home soon. . . . . .Mom's gonna wonder where I am. If she comes Iooking for me and sees you. . . . . .we got the screaming probIem again. So for now, wouId you, you know, just. . . . . .just stay here, okay? I'II come back tomorrow. Goodbye. No, no. Me go. You stay. No foIIowing. Good. I toId you! I'II come back tomorrow! Now, stay! Bad robot! Look, you can't go stomping around and you can't come with me. My mom wiII wig out. That's right. So you have got to stay in the forest. . . . . .and I'II bring you some food tomorrow. But I gotta go home now. So goodbye. Hey, wait a minute! What do you think you're doing? Look at this mess! Put it back! Put it back right now! HeIp me! I need your heIp! Good, good!

The train is coming! The train is coming! Come on, Iet's go! You're aIive! -Anybody out there? -We're in troubIe now. Are you aII right? I've changed my mind. You can foIIow me home. Let's go. Mayor's office. What? A train accident? He hit a giant creature? What creature couId be big enough to-- I need your car. You can fix yourseIf? Neato! Mom's home. Just stay here, okay? I'II be back. Bye! Bye. What happened here? Go on. TeII him what you saw, Frank. You're not gonna beIieve this. But it was a giant metaI man. Does anyone know where I can get to a teIephone nearby? WouId you say grace? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. . . . . .we thank you. For. . . . . .the food that Mom. . . . . .has put in front of us and-- Stop! The deviI. . . . . .from doing bad things and. . . . Get out of here! Satan? Go, so. . . . . .that we may Iive in peace. Amen. Amen. That was reaIIy unusuaI, Hogarth. Forgot to wash my hands. Stop, stop! AII right. Come on. Over here. Come on, over here. Come on. Hey there, scout. Kent MansIey. I work for the government. Hey, there. Kent MansIey. Work for the government. Your parents home? We're eating. Who's there, honey? HeIIo there. Do you have a teIephone I couId use? -In the kitchen. -Thank you. Thank you very much. Here. Pretend you're a gangster. -You caII me at home for this? -You don 't understand. -It ate my car. -And you saw this happen? No, I didn't actuaIIy see it. It went off into the woods. So you don 't have any evidence? But I've got an eyewitness! An eyewitness with a concussion. This thing is a menace. It tore up the power station. It caused a train wreck! What did? TeII me again, MansIey, and this time. . . .listen to yourself. A giant metaI monster. PIease, sir. I've got a feeIing about this one. That's lovely, Kent. But let me try to explain how this works. If you toId me you'd found, say, a giant footprint. . . . . .I'd send an expert to make a pIaster cast of it. Get me a photograph and I couId get some troops over there! But you teII me you've got a feeIing. . .? AII right, fine. You want evidence? I'II get you evidence. And when I do, I'm gonna want a memo distributed. That sounds sweII. I'll want that memo carbon-copied and redistributed-- Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone. Thank you for the use of your phone, Mrs. . .? Hughes. Annie Hughes. And this is my son, Hogarth. Thank you, Annie. Hobart. That's Hogarth! What an embarrassing name. Might as weII caII him Zeppo. What kind of a sick person wouId name a kid Hogar--? Hog Hug. Hogarth Hughes! Kent MansIey. You work for the government. I wasn't gonna say that. I have something for you, Hogarth. Your BB gun. Where did you find that? At the power station. -Hogarth was there the other night. -ReaIIy? See anything unusuaI, Hogarth? Nothing. . . . . .unusuaI, reaIIy. Gotta use the bathroom. Strange he's tightIipped. The other night he couIdn't stop taIking. I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot. A hundred-foot robot? That's nutty! What eIse did he say? No, wait, stop! Excuse me. What is going on in there? Are you aII right? I'm fine. You know, this sort of thing is why it's so important. . . . . .to reaIIy chew your food. A IittIe privacy?! Sorry. Sorry. He's been acting strange IateIy. That hurt. Thank you again, Annie. Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure we'II see each other again reaI soon. If you're gonna stay here. . . . . .you gotta keep better track of yourseIf. Anyway, I thought you'd Iike a bedtime story or something. I've got some reaIIy cooI ones. Mad Magazine, very funny. The Spirit, very cooI. Boy's Life? Oh, here. This guy is Superman. Sure, he's famous now. . . . . .but he started off just Iike you. Crash-Ianded on Earth. Didn't know what he was doing. But he onIy uses his powers for good, never for eviI. Remember that. That's Atomo, the metaI menace. He's not the hero. He's the viIIain. He's not Iike you. You're a good guy. Like Superman. Superman. You're hungry, aren't you? But I don't have any metaI here. Just foIIow me. Pick me up, okay? Okay, now, march! Oh, yeah. That's RockweII. Nice pIace, huh? RockweII? Yes, I was born right down there. RockweII! No, stop! Look out for the cow! Come on, no, not there! PIease stop. No, stop! We can't go there yet. PeopIe just aren't ready for you. That was cIose. We can't go running around Iike that, okay? Look! That wouId be okay to eat. It's been there for months. We gotta hide! You know, hide? It's when you-- You know, when you-- Just get behind something, quick! Don't move. Our troubIes are over. This is it. AII you can eat. Turn it off! Come on, turn it off! AII right, who's out there? I know you. SquirreI boy. By night, known as Hogarth. Got it. Come on inside, kid. Sorry about the crowbar. You'd be surprised how many peopIe wanna steaI scrap. But, man, once I turn it into art, I can't give it away. I mean, what am I? A junkman who seIIs art or an artist who seIIs junk? You teII me. I Iike it, I think. Listen, you're not gonna caII my mom, are you? She doesn't know I'm out. Don't worry, kid. It's not my styIe to report a guy to the authorities. I'm gonna have coffee. What do you want, some miIk, or what? MiIk? Coffee's fine. I drink it. I'm hip. I don't know. This is espresso, you know? It's Iike coffee-ziIIa. I said, I'm hip. She moved me up a grade. Now I'm more not fitting in. I was getting A's. Mom says, ''You need stimuIation. '' -I go, ''I'm stimuIated enough now. '' -That's for sure. ''You need a chaIIenge. '' So now I'm chaIIenged. . . . . .to keep my Iunch money because of the mooses who wanna pound me. . . . . .since they think I'm smarter. But I'm not, I just do the homework. If everyone did, they couId move up and get pounded too. More coffee? Look, it's reaIIy none of my business, kid. . . . . .but who cares what these creeps think, you know? They don't decide who you are. You do. You are who you choose to be. -Did you hear that? -No, wait. Stop! It's okay! My God! -He isn't gonna-- -Run, kid! Run! It's okay. He isn't-- It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me. Don't squash him! Do not. . . . . .squash him. His name is Dean. We Iike Dean. So. . . . . .where'd he come from? He doesn't remember. He's Iike a IittIe kid. LittIe. Yeah. Wait a minute. You can taIk to him? He can't say a Iot of words yet, but he understands things pretty good. I see. He needs food and sheIter. You got plenty of room here. -This pIace is perfect. -Go away. I can have him push the door down. You know I can. I can't hide it here. -''Him,'' not ''it. '' -Whatever. You don't even know where ''he'' came from. Or what the heII ''he'' is! He's my friend. Yeah, what am I? Am I your friend? Bring a Franken-bot with out-of-state pIates, make me change my tune. I don't Iike that jazz. God, I'm tired. So, he can stay? Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know. I don't know about tomorrow. SIeep tight. I'II see you tomorrow. -You're up? -Just making the bed. That's nice. Come downstairs. I have a surprise for you. Morning, sport. SIeep weII? Isn't it wonderfuI? We finaIIy rented our room. I'm not very hungry. -This is Hogarth Hughes. -I said he couId stay the night, kid. It's morning now. I'II try to come over. But there's this weird guy here who's watching me. What's that mean? I got this big, giant-- Giant thing out here. I can't taIk right now, okay? Bye. Who was that, sport? Friend of yours? Yeah. He's a new kid. Stop! Stop that! Stop it! Mind if I ask you a few questions, buckaroo? Why wouId you teII your mom about a giant robot? What was at the power station? TeII anyone eIse? How big is this thing? Been in the forest IateIy? Champ? SIugger? Cowboy? Where you going? I'm going out! Why not take Mr. MansIey with you? Show him the sights. Oh, Mom, the sights? I'd Iove that. Give us a chance to get acquainted. There are two kinds of metaI. Scrap and art. If you gotta eat one, eat the scrap. What you currentIy have in your mouth is art! Art? Forget it. Forget it! It's gone. It's-- That's not bad. First, you take a chocoIate bar. Any bar'II do. Do you mind if I. . .? Knock yourseIf out, skipper. You crumbIe up the chocoIate into IittIe pieces. Then you kind of stir it into the ice cream. See? Yes, I see. What do you caII this again? LandsIide. It's new. Very new. LandsIide. Topnotch. You know, Hogarth, we Iive in a strange and wondrous time. The Atomic Age. But there's a dark side to progress. Ever hear of Sputnik? Yeah, it's the first sateIIite in space. Foreign sateIIite, Hogarth, and aII that that impIies. Even now, it orbits overhead. Watching us. We can't see it, but it's there. Much Iike that giant thing in the woods. We don't know what it is or what it can do. I don't feeI safe. Do you? What are you taIking about? What am I taIking about? What am I taIking about?! I'm taIking about your goIdarned security! WhiIe you're snoozing. . . . . .back in Washington, we're wide-awake and worried. Why? Because everyone wants what we have! Everyone! You think this metaI man is fun. But who buiIt it? The Russians? The Chinese? Martians? I don't care! We didn't buiId it, and that's reason enough. . . . . .to assume the worst and bIow it to kingdom come! Now, you'II teII me about this thing. You'II Iead me to it. And we are going to destroy it before it destroys us! HoId that thought and stay there. LittIe Iower. LittIe bit Iower. . . . I thought you were in troubIe. That sucks. Let me. . . . I ditched this weird guy staying at our house. It took me hours to shake him! I kiII myseIf to get out here! And you have him doing arts and crafts. You got a probIem with arts and crafts, IittIe man? He's a giant robot, Dean. It's a IittIe undignified. WeII, smart guy, what wouId you have him do? Main systems on. Main engines. One, two and three. AII systems go. Five, four, three. . . . . .two, one! BIast off! We're Ianding. We're Ianding! We're Ianding! Say, can you guys cooI yourseIves a IittIe? We're pressing our Iuck here. Hey, baby, we are cooI! WeIcome to downtown CooIsviIIe. PopuIation: us. WeII, can you move CooIsviIIe to some pIace Iess conspicuous? How about the Iake? Come with us. It'II be fun. This can't Iast forever. We gotta teII somebody about him. You worry too much. Watch this! AII right, we're watching. This one's for professionaIs onIy! Banzai! Come on in! The water's great! No, thanks. You weenie! Come on in. It's reaIIy, reaIIy refreshing. What? You too? You. . . . . .big baby! Banzai! You're right in the middIe of the road! AII right. I think that's enough fun for one day. Are you okay in there? I'm back with the toiIet paper you needed. Thanks! I think I'm feeIing better now. Much. Much better. It's beautifuI, huh? Hey, Iook! It's a deer. Let's get cIoser. WeII, I guess he decided to-- It's the monster! It's dead. Dead? Don't do that! Why? It's dead. Understand? They shot it. . . . . .with that gun. What's wrong? -Gun. -Yes. Guns kiII. Guns kiII. I know you feeI bad about the deer. But it's not your fauIt. Things die. It's part of Iife. It's bad to kiII. But it's not bad to die. You die? WeII. . . . . .yes, someday. I die? I don't know. You're made of metaI. . . . . .but you have feeIings. And you think about things. And that means you have a souI. And souIs don't die. SouI? Mom says it's something inside of aII good things. . . . . .and that it goes on forever and ever. SouIs don't die. You're Iate for dinner. Your mom's working Iate tonight. So it's just us guys. And we're gonna have a IittIe chat. Sit down! How's that? A IittIe too bright? Good. Forgive me. I wanted you to Iearn something. What can I Iearn from you? You can Iearn this: I can do anything I want, when I want. . . . . .if it's in the peopIe's best interest. The giant metaI man, where is it? I don't know what you're taIking about. You don't? WeII. Does this ring a beII? How about this? You've been careIess. It doesn't prove anything. It'II get the Army here with one caII. What's stopping you? Where's the giant?! You can't protect him. . . . . .any more than you can protect your mother. It's difficuIt to raise a boy aIone. We can make it more difficuIt. In fact, we can make it so difficuIt. . . . . .it wouId be irresponsibIe to Ieave you in her care. . . . . .and aII that that impIies. -You'II be taken away from her. -You can't do that! Oh, we can. And we wiII. He's in the junkyard. McCoppin's Scrap, off CuIver Road. The junkyard. Of course! Food for the metaI-eater. I wouIdn't worry about this. It isn't reaIIy happening. This is onIy a bad dream. Where's the giant? This is only a bad dream. Yes, sir. This thing is reaI, sir. I not onIy have incontrovertibIe evidence, I know where it's hidden. I don't know who buiIt it, but it's massive and we're running out of time. No doubt we shouId act. The question is. . . . . .can you afford not to? ExceIIent, sir. You won't regret it. Thank you, sir. The Army arrives in the morning. Don't get cute. I gotta warn Dean. I'II be watching you. Morning, Kent. For some reason, the Army is in our front yard, Mr. MansIey. PIease, caII me Kent. -AII right, where is it? -What? You know darn weII what. The monster. The giant thing. The metaI man. The metaI man. Jeez, you were scaring me there for a second. I thought I was under attack or something. He's in the back. Come on. I'II show you. You guys got here just in time. This rich cat, some industriaIist. . . . . .wants him for the Iobby of his company. He whipped out his checkbook. I said, ''Hey, you got him for the rest of your Iife. But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment I give birth? I mean, come on. Give me some time to cut the umbiIicaI. '' Here he is. Anyway, I haven't soId him yet. So if you reaIIy want him and if, you know, you throw in. . . . . .a competitive bid. . . . Sir, Iisten. Step outside, MansIey. You reaIize how much hardware I brought out here?! You just bIew miIIions of UncIe Sam's doIIars out of your butt! I gotta admit, I'm reIieved that. . . . . .this is what Hogarth was taIking about. I mean, I was beginning to think it was reaI. I mean, don't get me wrong. I Iike it. But do you need aII this stuff on the surface? No, actuaIIy. It seems kind of sIapped on. Not as thought-out as this other piece. You Iike that one? You'II be inspector of toiIets when I'm finished with you! Pack up. I'II expect you back in Washington to cIear out your office. Yes, sir. I see why Hogarth sneaks out here. You mean, you know about that? Now I do. Bye, Kent, and aII that that impIies. Okay, you can move now. Nice job! Thruster to base. I'm going in. OnIy one creature couId create so much destruction. The hideous, peopIe-eating. . . . . .kiIIing machine, Atomo! No Atomo. I Superman. Okay, Superman. Take this! Stupid gun. What's wrong? As I was saying, take this! What happened? What--? Stay down and foIIow me. Get back! I said, get back! I mean it! No, stop. Why? It was an accident. He's our friend. He's a piece of hardware. Why do you think the Army was here? He's a weapon! A big gun that waIks! I not gun. Yeah, what's that? You aImost did that to Hogarth! Come back! -Stop! -Giant! Come back! It was defensive. He reacted to the gun. You won't get there fast enough on foot. See, I toId you it was a big hoax. Give me the binocuIars. There it is. I see it! It's big. It's waIking away. -Give me those. -There! See it? The monster! HoIy cow! Watch it! HeIp! Somebody heIp me! I don't wanna faII! HeIp! I'm sIipping! I can't hoId on much Ionger! -Dad! -Daddy! -He saved those boys! -It's friendIy! What--? Stop! Look! Behind you! The giant, it's attacking! It's stomping the town! I was right! -Sweet Mother of God. -Look, damn you! I am not a gun. Let's get out of here! Run! Stop! There's a kid in his hands! Stop shooting! He onIy reacts defensiveIy. If you don't shoot, he's harmIess. TeII the generaI! This is your fauIt, beatnik. If you-- Shut up and Iisten! You've gotta make them stop. The giant's got the kid. I'II take care of it. He says the monster's kiIIed a kid. Sir, we must stop it at aII costs. Go to code red. Repeat, code red! Mr. President, we have a situation, sir. Watch it, Iady! Look out for the bus! You can fIy? You can fIy! Try pointing your arms straight ahead, Iike Superman! I've Iost visuaI. Repeat, Iost visuaI! Man, that was cIose! Good caII, MansIey. Secure the area. Let's find out what this thing is and who sent it. -It's stiII aIive! -Shoot at it! Retreat! Retreat! Let's get out of here! He's unconscious, but okay. Let's get him in the car. Drive, baby, drive! Step on it! FIoor it! It's gaining on us. Faster! Faster! Hurry! AII battIeships fire! Now! Now, damn it, now! Nothing can stop it! We've hit it with everything! Not everything, generaI. The bomb. The Nautilus isn't far offshore. You scare me. You want us to bomb ourseIves in order to kiII it? The giant foIIows whatever attacks it. We can Iure it away from the town, then destroy it. TeII the Nautilus to target the robot and await my command. This is Nautilus. What's the giant's position? 67.71972 degrees west by 44.50177 degrees north. Locked and Ioaded. My baby, I'm so sorry. -Stop the car. -You're aII right. Go back! We've gotta heIp him! Are you crazy? You're Iucky to be aIive! You're going to a hospitaI. Out of the car! We're evacuating. We gotta get this boy to a hospitaI. What boy? Hogarth, no! No! Stop! This is GeneraI Rogard. Ready the attack and retreat to the faIIback position. No! Stop! My son is out there! No, wait. It's me. . . . . .Hogarth. Remember? It's bad to kiII. Guns kiII. And you don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be. You choose. Choose. It's okay. It's okay. We gotta show them you're good. Missile ready. What are you saying, he's friendIy? Attacking him triggers a defense mechanism. Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster whiIe we stiII have the chance! You shoot and the whoIe thing starts over. Stop it now! Our future's at stake! Orders, sir? Which is why you have got to stop. It's getting cIoser! Orders, sir?! Don't shoot! HoId your fire! The boy's aIive? It's a trick! Launch it. Are you mad, MansIey? AII units, stand down! Rogard to Nautilus. Come in, Nautilus. NautiIus standing by. Launch the missiIe! It's targeted to the giant's current position! Where's the giant, MansIey? We can duck and cover. There's a sheIter right there. There's no way to survive this, you idiot! You mean, we're aII going to-- To die, MansIey, for our country. Screw our country! I want to Iive! HoId him, men. Make sure he stays here, Iike a good soIdier. It's a missiIe. When it comes down. . . . . .everyone wiII die. There it is! -ShouIdn't we get to a sheIter? -It wouIdn't matter. I fix. You stay. I go. No foIIowing. I Iove you. You are who you choose to be. Superman. Let's go home. Your best work yet, honey. No doubt about it. You think this is my best? ReaIIy? You know, next to that bug thing. You know, the one with the shoveIs. . . . Come on, honey. Time to go. See you Iater, guys. See you Iater, Hogarth. -The generaI sent this. -What is it? He said it was the onIy part recovered. He thought you shouId have it. I miss him. See you Iater! The earth is at peace. There is no hunger. There is no violence. The environment is healed. Honesty, courtesy, and kindness are practiced by all. Our world has never been more. perfect. No leaders. No longer our world. We've been invaded by an alien race. They occupy the body of almost all human beings on the planet. A few humans who have survived. are on the run. - Please, come with us. - We will help you. - Please, be careful. - Please, don't hurt yourself. We don't want to hurt you. - Like hell. - No. Barely a bone not broken or organ ruptured. I cannot tell you why she's not dead. This one wants to live. Welcome. I'm Healer Fords. What should I call you? You have lived many lives in many worlds. A wanderer such as yourself, it must have been a name. Call. me. Wanderer. When will she be able to work? - Not now. - Of course. No. I haven't died. I didn't die. That's right. I'm still there. Don't think this is yours. This body is mine. No, mine. I don't know how much they know about this new world. Almost every human has been successfully occupied. As with the other planets you've inhabited. We do not change this world. But experience it. And perfect it. - What did you think? Did you think I just give up? - However. There is still packet of human resistance. That threatens our peace. Your host was part of that resistance. You want me to locate her memories? Yes, from those memories we can locate other rebels. - Good luck with that. - But I must warn you. Most humans fade away, but there are a few who fight the occupation. Her name is Melanie Stryder. She was born in Louisiana. Her family escaped the initial ways of colonization. But it was only a matter of time. Her father was discovered alone. He took his life rather than be taken by our seekers. And risk the lives of his children. Melanie has been on the run since with. - No. Don't say it. Don't you say it. Please, I beg you. - She's resisting? Jamie, his name is Jamie Stryder. I hate you. If only I could hurt you. I understand why you are resistant. You believe the loss of your will is too great to sacrifice. But we have to think of the common good. Call it whatever you want. This is murder. - A sound and you die. - Do it, I'd rather die. This is impossible. You're human. Stop. Wait. Look at me. I'm human. Just like you. Get off me. - I'm Sorry. My name is Jared Howe. I didn't mean to scare you. I haven't spoken to another human being in two years. I guess you haven't been kissed in a while either. Melanie. Stryder. I've got someone waiting for me. - You're not alone? - It's my kid brother. He's hungry. I ran two hours to get to this house. I can give you a ride. This is faster than running. It's even faster than you running. Are you going to pretend like you didn't feel something just now? I know you felt that. Stop that. Stop. What you're doing is wrong. And you know it. After meeting Jared Howe, Melanie and her brother stayed with him. They settled in an abandoned place. It had to be explored by our souls. They coud almost forget the invasion and what happening around them. You haven't kissed me since that first night. Melanie, You don't have to. We can be the last ones. And even if we are. You are the last . on Earth. You still don't have to. But I want to. When you touch me, it's. I don't want you to stop. - We should sleep. - Then Sleep with me. All I'm saying is. We have to hide. - You don't know that. You don't know if we've got months, or days. We can be taken at any moment. We only have this. Now. Yes, Seeker. - You have not spoken for several minutes. Were they lovers? These people are not like the others bodies you have inhabited. They have unusually strong physical drivers. You must to be vigilant. They saw Seekers nearby. They were not found, but knew they had to move on. They were headed. I can't see where. A safe place with others. Hope. Before the long journey, they spent the night in an old hotel that thought was safe. Jared was out searching for supplies for the trip. Come on. Stay here, and don't move. I wanna go with you. - I'll lead them away, and come right back. I promise. Come on. No. Now you know, I will do everything. Go on. There is nothing more now. - There has to be more. I'll keep trying. Please do, Wanderer. No, no, wait, stop. You were not meant to see that. You can't know that. That could kill them. Get rid of it, get rid of it, now, please. You were not meant to see that. - Quiet. Wanderer, please. After everything you've seen, how can you still help them? Surprise surprise, look who's here. What a pleasant surprise, Seeker. Did you follow me? Only in case you needed me. - Yes, right. She is so full of it. What are you doing here? I thought a change of scenery might help. Change? Wasn't your last plan completely covered by water? It's been weeks since you've had new information. Do you know where they are? If you can't say no, say nothing. Walk away. - Do you feel pity them? The humans? - Don't you? In your other lives, have you ever felt anything like this? They were brutal. Killing each other, killing their planet. Unlucky they survived as long as they did. But I do have some good news. Your identification of Jared Howe has helped. There was a siding (?). I am confident that we will find him. No. Seeker, I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was doing. - Perhaps because you weren't doing it. - We have put you through enough. Your host appears to resist that. You are going be re-implanted to a more compliant host. - Is he saying what I think he is saying? - What will happen to this body? It is time for someone else to search her memories. Her? You? Yes, my body can be held for me, and I will return to it. When we have the information we need. - Then what will happen to Melanie Strayer? - She will have the death she originally desired. Unlike the way humans kills, it will be done humanly. Stop her, do something. - My Healer has agreed to this? - No. He transferred to Fort Worth. Don't feel bad. You're not the only one, there are others who have not had the strength of will. - When? - We make the transfer tomorrow. There'll stay outside your door tonight, so no harm will come to you. Or to others. Please, I don't care if I die. I can't have her inside me. - Melanie, I have to do my duty. - You have to do what's right. She'll kill my family. Jane, Jared, she'll kill them. Wanderer, please. The healer, do you think he would help? - I think so. But I don't know how to reach him. - We need to find him. We have to get out of here. We? Yes, put the chair against the door. No, the other way. How does this help? There's no way out. Yes there is, that way. That way. Do it wanderer, move. Open it. Come on, you can do this. It's not so high. This is nothing. It's gonna be okay. Climb up. Now jump. - I can't. It's a good thing I can. Swim. Wanderer, are you alright? - You could've killed us. - Run. Step aside. I'm sorry. We need to steal a car. Don't worry, I've done it before. - Let me handle this. - You? What are you doing? Wait. Quiet. - Do you need help? - May I borrow your vehicle? Please, it's important. - Certainly. Can I be of assistance? - No, thank you. This is an extremely reliable model. The tank is full. - That's a good trick. - It was no trick. We do not lie. We trust each other. - You guys take the fun out of everything. Where are we going? I'll take you to my healer in Fort Worth. Even if your healer agrees to keep me inside you. I'll still a prisoner. - But you'll still be alive. And so the people you love. That Seeker is a lot of things but she's not a fool. Sooner or later she'll work out where you're going. - We need a map. - I show you the way. What's wrong? Are the memories too painful? How do you think I feel? - I know how you feel. That's the problem. You take the body, the feelings come with it. It's a package deal. - Where are we? - You tell me. You're the one with the steering wheel. You sent us in the wrong way. You've been putting thoughts in my head to distract me. The Seeker was right. You are a non-reasonable species. I try to help you, and this is how you thank me? We are going to Forth Worth. - No. - Will it still work? - Not anymore. - Now, what do we do? - We walk. - Which way? - You can go my way. Or you can go your own way and kill us both. - You planned this. - I made a promise. I promised my brother I'll come back. How could I've been so foolish? I can never trust you again. - How do I know I can trust you? I'm giving you exactly what you wanted. Taking you to my family could get them killed. We head east. Come on. Don't leave tracks. Walk on the rocks. Did you really think you could beat me? - Save the water. We're gonna need it. - I need it now. We've been walking for ages. How do you think you're going to find them? - My uncle had a cabin out here in the desert. We were heading out here to join them. If he survived. It's further than I thought. - I don't know how much further I can go. We've walked too far to walk back. - Come on, girl. Stay with me. - Uncle Jeb. You've found us. - Us? Jamie, Jared? Are they here? Are they safe? I told you I saw one. Why did you give her water? - She was dying. - Uncle Jeb. I'm in here. - Hold it, Kyle. Why? She's one of them. - Yeah, she surely is, but. it's also my niece. - Was. I'm just saying it's complicated, Ian. - I can make it simple. - Me too. Help Maggie. Don't fool us. Parasite. Oh God, they don't see me. They only see you. - No, Maggie. - Don't you Maggie me. My brother, he could bring an all (?) army down on our heads. - I don't see anything. - I'm in here. I'm in here. - This is unkind, Jebadie. Let's go. Life is unkind, Magnolia. Watch your head. - Where are we, Wanderer? I reckon it's safe enough now. So many humans are alive. We haven't lost. Jared's alive, Jared's. Enough, Jared. Jebadie, I know it's hard, but we got to do what's best for everyone. She's got to go Doc's place. Just like the rest. Ain't that right, Doc? No. I don't see any tracks. - She didn't fly away. - Miss Wanderer is living up to her name. We find her, we find the resistance. Melanie. Wanderer, they don't know a human can stay alive in a body. You can't tell them I'm in here. They won't believe you. They'll think you're lying to save yourself. Oh God, they are going to kill us. I'm sorry. Move aside, Jared. Go out of the way. You can't keep her prisoner forever. It's gonna escape and lead them to us. I don't want to hurt you, Jared. But I will. No, grab what you want (?). - Stop. Go back. Grab what you want (?). Leave him alone. Keep breathing. Come on, Wanderer. Fight, fight. - Finish it. Evening, everyone. I hate to remind you but this is my place, and you are my guests. For the moment she is too. I don't take kindly (?) that my guests strangling each other. Jeb, it's got to die. We took a vote. - This ain't a democracy. It's a dictatorship. It's a benign dictatorship, but it's a dictatorship just the same. - Will you tell us what you plan on doing with it? - This ain't never happened before. One of our own coming back. For night now, this tunnel is off limits. If I find any of you back here, I'll ask questions second. I take the next watch, Jared. Keep it away from the kid. I don't think we are looking for Wanderer, I think we are looking for a body. Even if she was not hurt in the wreck, how long could she survive in this place? In my experience, this hostess' difficulty dying. - There is too much land for us to cover. - I'm requesting more seekers. Ground and air patrols. - Are they really such a threat? ??? He's still pissed you hit him. I told him you're sorry. - I'm not. - I know. No one's ever saw you hurting my brother. (?) Looks like they are calling off the search. Not that one. Jamie, little brother. - Do you know who I am? - You're Jamie. But you're not Melanie. I want to know what happened to my sister that night. She said that she was gonna come back. If he can't know I'm alive, he deserves to know what happened to me. I'm not a kid. Please. To protect you and Jared, she tried to take her life. Our Healers mend at her. And put me in her, hoping I can found out but there were other human survivors. - Do you have a name? - They call me Wanderer. - Where do you come from? - Another planet. Damn it Jeb, I told you. To keep her away from the kid but you never say nothing to keep the kid away from her. Jamie, that is not Melanie. She's never coming back. - It's still her body. - Get out of here now or so help me hell. I'll look after Jamie. We'll watch it. I don't trust her. Could be another Seeker. She-- It's the furthest thing from a Seeker I have ever seen. - I mean, she jumped between you and Kyle. - They are just trying to find a way to stay alive. Are you going to give Kyle a go ahead and kill her--? It. - It's a good plan. - What the hell is going on your mind, buddy? It is the enemy. Don't forget it. I don't feel bad at that. I've killed-- - It doesn't matter. It's not human. So we stop acting human? This is a big planet. There's been a siding of humans in your area. We're commencing the full scan search. Something, ain't it? Found this place by accident. Really it found me. I fell through the roof. I almost died trying to find a way out of these caves. There's only one. No one's found it on their own since I did. Kept the place to myself. Good thing too, without this we would all be dead, right? Wanderer, sounds trouble in this caves. Your name is a mouthful. You mind if I shorten it? Life's short. Especially right now. Mind if I call you. Wanda? We get our power from the sun, earth, any place we can. It's actually an extinct volcano. Not quite extinct. Watch yourself. You fall in, you're not coming back. Afternoon everyone. It's all yours. You all got your shades? Make sure you wear them. You already look like an alien. Makes you feel like a human being again, don't it? Bad joke? You got all the resources you wanted, Seeker. You've probably seen a lot, but nothing like this. Nothing. How? - Same way the magicians do it. Mirrors. And they all said Jeb was crazy. How many crazy people can pull this off? It's almost ready to harvest. It can't come too soon. We sure need the grain. Everyone here thinks you're gonna betray us to the seekers. Makes sense. What else would you be? When I can wrap my head around this, what kind of a plan was that? Walking in the desert with no backup and no way to get yourself back. If like you say, you are not coming here for the Seekers, why were you doing it? Then I started thinking, when they put one of you in our heads. Do we still exist, trapped in there? If our memories are still alive, are we? Gotta believe some people won't go out without a fight. Oh I know I wouldn't go quiet but I've never seen fight like him now. But she fights for him more than anything, and the people that she loves. I wonder. If a love like that might play on someone's mind. I might guess somebody will do something they wouldn't ordinarily do 374 00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:45,702 Maybe you're here 'cause you do actually care about Jared and the kid. You, Wanda. He sees everything. He's not crazy, he's a genius. I think he's both. I wonder. a lot about a lot of things. But I'm not the only one. Care to join us, Jamie? Uncle Jeb, how did you know I was here? The mirrors. The mirrors! Help him. I saw something. Help. I saw evidence of humans. That's the evidence of us. There's nothing here. Thank you. They're gone. Gone for now. Jared and the others are still out there. Jamie, why don't you take over guard duty? - What will I do? - Keep an eye on him. You'll figure it out. This way. You can't give a boy a loaded gun. That's why I didn't. Where is he taking us? Are you taking me to my cell? I miss the outdoors. And I was thinking that maybe you were starting to miss it too. Be real quiet. Okay, sit here. You can open your eyes now. What stars are these? I've never seen this constellation. They're not stars, they're glow worms. You have to be quiet, or they get scared and stop shining. When I miss the sky, I come here. It's beautiful. I heard what Uncle Jeb was saying. He thinks that Melanie might still be alive. Inside there with you I mean. Can that happen? Does it, Wanda? Why won't you answer me? Is Melanie still alive? Wanda, please. Forget what I said. Tell him. She promised she we would come back. Has Melanie ever broken a promise to you? I love you, Melanie. She loves you too. She's so happy you're safe. Is everyone like that? Does everybody stay? Not like Melanie. She is special. She's very strong. She wanted to keep her promise. She couldn't have kept her promise, if you didn't help her keep it. Thank you, Wanda. It's our secret, okay? Good evening, sir. Can I help you? I think you can. Are you all right? - No racing. - Yeah, sure It's ready. I figured this time, you start earning your keep. I see you both in the east field. Morning, Jamie. Why is he looking at you? Why are you looking at him? Don't forget he tried to kill you. Did you hear me? He tried to kill you. Don't you dare smile at him. We better take care of that. There, that one is going faster than the limit. - Please take the next exit. - Fire. - It ain't going any good. - I don't care. Keep firing. Don't get caught. Take him out. Please stop your vehicle and safely exit. Please stop your engine and safely exit. There are others. I always liked science fiction stories. I never dreamed I'll be living in one. How many planets have life? Just remember Wanda, you're not one of them. Twelve, that we know of. Four I've never been to. We've just opened upß a new world. - You've conquered twelve planets? It's not how we see it. We've always lived by bonding with another species. It's how we survive. We try to live in harmony. Enough. Lose him. No. They'll to catch us. Let's go. We have enough. Let's go. We almost had them. Seeker, this is not who we are. You've killed a soul. - We have to make sacrifices. This is a war. - This war is over. The last of the resistance will die on its own. They will become extinct. But I think there's a little of raging in you, Seeker. I'm going home, so are you. You don't know what's going on. We are losing control. Wanda, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you? Over a thousand of your years. I have not completed one revolution of your sun. Yet I have found that. Earth is more beautiful and harder than any place I've ever been. - I've got to say this is the most interesting conversation I've had in. - What is this? Out of the way. - She's not a threat. No? Ian and Brandt are dead, thanks to the seekers who were looking for it. Almost got us too. I'm going to end this once and for all. - Jared, you can't. - Why not? Because if you kill Wanda. No, no, Jamie. You kill Melanie. She's still alive in there. I believe it. You all letting it fool you. Come on, Jeb. I'm so sorry. I'm going back to my cell. This will blow over. - You can stay at my place. She will be safe there. You tried to kill me and now you're protecting me? A strange world, isn't it? The strangest. - What's wrong, Doc? - You try it. Wanda, I just want you to know that I trust you. and I believe you're telling us the truth. But I gotta ask you. What's it like for you and her living in there together? It's crowded. Let me know if you need anything. I'll just be right out here. I think he likes you too much. What is "too much"? If I have got anything to do with it, you'll never find out. I know it's with you. - Oh God. - I'm not going to kill it. I just want to talk to her. It's okay, I'll talk to him. Her name is Wanda, not 'it'. I'm so sorry about what happened out there. To your friends. I've never meant to hurt anyone. Wanda, Jamie and Jeb believe. that Melanie is still alive and kicking in there. I am! I am. In fact, Jeb has this crazy notion that you're here for Jamie and me. You brought Melanie back to us. I can't believe it. I don't want to believe that she's in there, trapped. That makes it so much worse somehow. But I got to know. Is Melanie in there? Whatever happens happens, tell him I'm here. And tell him I love him. - I'm afraid. - The thing is, Wanda. I have to stop dreaming about Melanie. I dream about you too. I miss everything about her. I would do anything to get her back. And you know what makes it so much harder. It's still her body. If it wasn't for those eyes. I got to thinking. If I can't kiss her. I can kiss you. What? No! What is he doing? No! Stop it. Stop! Now! Don't do this! I knew it. Are you really in there? You hit me for kissing it. I love you. I know you can't say it back but I love you. So now he believes it too. It doesn't help anyone. Knowing I am a prisoner in here, it just hurts them more. - Wanda? - Hide! Wanda, get out of here. Run. Run! - Grab my hand! - What are you doing? Let go. - He'll die! - Good, if he dies, he can't kill us. Help! You're lucky, your head is harder than any rock in this place. You'll live. - I wouldn't be too sure about that, Doc. - What happened? - Tell him. - It was an accident. - Like hell. I thought you didn't lie? - Kyle slipped. - Sure he did. - If that's what it says happened then. We all know what happened. You tried to kill her. And for some unknown reason, she saved your sorry ass. If it's true Kyle, you're out. Did he tried to kill you? It's not saying he did. You're the one who has to live with him under the same roof. Kyle, I'm warning you. Don't even look at her wrong. We haven't shot anyone in a long time. Kind of miss that. Thrill of it. We gotta get back to work. Come on, let's go. - I'm going back out. - There are many seekers out there. We lost a lot in that last run. There are a couple of things that I need. Take Kyle with you. Come on, Kyle. And you, keep away from her. Do you want to take a walk? Didn't Jared tell you to stay away from me? This is not a good idea. You can open your eyes now. I'm outside. There really is the sky. - I like you, Wanda. - I like you too. You didn't say that. No, not like that. Get his hands off me. This can't work. - What are you doing? - Let me guess, you have two minds about it. Is it about Jared? - Yes, it's about Jared. Melanie is in love with him. - And you? - Tell him. This body loves him. And since it is now my body. So do I. But I also have feelings of my own. - No, you don't. Wanda, no. Stop! You are not going there. What about Jared? This is very complicated. Is there any way Melanie can give us some privacy? A getaway moment. Step into the other room? - You wish. I don't think that's possible right now. You know. It's not really me you like. It's this body. You couldn't care for me. If you could hold me. me. in your hand, it would be disgusting. You'll crush me. - You don't know that. Wanda, no! This is so wrong. You're not even from the same planet. I'll do something. I'll hurt him. Strange to be in a body that won't let me use it. I think you better take me back. Is he safe? You still have two minds. You're angry when I kiss a man you do love, and angry when I kiss a man you don't. It's very confusing. I am not weak. I am in control. You will never win. Jamie, where is everyone? - I don't know. - Why is he lying? He never lies. Your leg should better by now. You need to see Doc. I just came from there. He told me to go and lie down. I'm going to wash up. I'll meet you in your room. This doesn't make sense. What is Doc thinking? What's more important than getting Jamie better? Hold on, wait. Wanda, go back. Wanda, don't go in there. Turn around! Go back. Monsters. Wait, Wanda. - Wanda, stop. - Get out of my head. Get out! I'm sorry. You know that there are easier ways to die than to starve yourself to death. Yes. I could always visit Doc. What did you expect, Wanda? You expect us to just give up? This is our world. We haven't just lost a world, we are dying out. We try to get our people back. What you're trying to do is impossible. It doesn't work like that. All you're going to do is keep murdering more of both of us. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I can't stay here. Not with you slaughtering my family in the next room. If you say our way won't work. I will tell the boys no more hostages. It's probably for the best, I don't think Doc could take much more. How can I trust you? I'm trusting you. There is something else. Melanie, are you there? Melanie, where are you? Jamie's hurt. I need you. Talk to me. Melanie, please come back, I can't do this without you. - I want you to know that Doc and everything. - Don't worry about that now. We have to get you better. You sound like Melanie. Did Melanie say that just then? You need you to kiss me. - What about Melanie? - Don't worry about Melanie. Kiss me like you want to get slapped. - Is she stopping you? - No, that's the problem. We are alone. She's gone. Ever since I told her to get out of my head. I'm afraid I've lost her. She got so angry before when you kissed me. I thought she'd come back. Then I guess you'll have to make her very angry. Kiss her. I lost Melanie. I don't know if she's still there. You need to bring her back. She hates me kissing you. Melanie, come back. I'm not losing you. Oh, stop! - Melanie, you've bitten me. - Wanda, what the hell? - Melanie, I'm glad you're back. - Did I leave? - For three days. You don't know what I went through to find you. - Yeah, you look like you were suffering. - You have to help Jamie. He's hurt. Come on. - Stop! Where are you going? - It's infected. It's got into Jamie's blood stream. He needs medicine. - There's no medicine out, you destroyed all. - He doesn't need your medicine. It's too late for that. He needs ours. You have to take me out of the cave. You'll have to trust me. Cut me, I need a wound like Jamie's. - I can't do that. - I'll be healed in minutes. Take it from him. Do it yourself. They'll be suspicious for the scar. I can cover it with a cut. It's gonna be okay. Excuse me. - Goodness, we have an emergency. You can do this, Wanda. I am Healer Skye. What happened? - Tell her you tripped. Tell her you tripped. - I tripped. - With a knife in your hand. - With a knife in my hand. I cut myself. You poor thing. Let's fix you up. Heal. Seal. - Send her away. - If it isn't no trouble, could I please have some water? Of course. Hurry, take it. - What do you think? - Perfect. Thank you. Goodbye. What are you doing? We have to go. - Is he alive? - Barely. - What is all that? - Medicine. - Wait, no, no, we don't know what that will do. - She knows what she's doing. We all know what happens when we do nothing. He'll die. - Doc, it's okay. - Please. Do it. Doc, do it. That's it. Come on, Jamie, open your eyes. Please. You're getting good, Doc. I've walked out of plenty of stores without paying. First time anyone's been happy about it. I like it better when we are stealing. - You spoil everything, Wanda. Oh, no! Wes. Hello, Wanderer. Seeker. Why did you waste the medicine on me? Aren't you gonna kill me? Can I speak to her alone? Does that include me? I guess it does. - We'll be outside. You just say the word. Wanda? Surely you go by Melanie now. Did you ask to kill me yourself Melanie? What are you waiting for? I'm not here to kill you. You're my interrogator. I do want to know something. Why. Why couldn't you just let me go? Because I was right. I know the threat a weak soul like you represents. Unlike you I'm doing my duty, I'm fighting for us. We cannot live with them like the other worlds. You more than anyone know that. Did you come alone? Other seekers will come looking for me just like I came looking for you. No one else is coming to find you. You're dying and the danger dies with you. The people here will be safe. So you are going to kill me. Wanda, what is this? What are you thinking? Don't put up walls against me. Talk to me. I've never had the chance to say how truly. - There is a way to make up for it. I know how to do what you've been ending so many lives trying to do. I can take a soul from a body. You can do what? What are you saying, Wanda? I'll only give you this knowledge on the condition you do as I ask. And promise that no harm will come to any soul. I can promise you that. There's one other thing you must promise. And you must promise to keep it a secret. You have to let me die. - No! No! No! I can't do that, Wanda. I can't. It's the only way I can give you what you want. Wanda, no. She's out. So you don't want us to kill the Seeker? She killed Wes. Who knows how many others. She wouldn't blink about butchering us. - There's been too much killing. Not death, but exile. You want us to forgive her. And let them go, just like that. We, souls, can leave the same way we arrived. I will send her away. By the time she reaches another planet. your grandchildren will have died of old age. You've always trying to extract it by force. The secret is you do not remove it. It removes itself. You coax it out. You've always seen as the enemy. He can feel the hate. It can only be captured by kindness. Love. Ian, help me. Thank you. - What is your name? - I'm Lacey. My name is Lacey. I've been screaming inside for years. Nobody could hear me. You're the reason why she wouldn't leave me alone. Yes, she wasn't just after humans. She is hoping to find a way to fight the hosts. Like me. And you, Melanie. who fight back. Have a safe trip. and a long one. Always send the souls to the most distant planets. Wanda, do you miss it out there? The other worlds? I miss many things. Don't you miss Melanie? Don't you want your sister back? She is here now. You know he's right. Not the way she needs to be. I think. I think it's time to move on. - Leave us? But you can always come back, right? I asked you here so no one would shout. I wish I could shout loud enough for them to hear. As soon as I knew what to do with the Seeker. I knew there was a way for all you to get your loved ones back. without hurting the souls. And of course. I knew I had to give Melanie back to herself. And leave. - That can't happen, Wanda. We need you. - Us or you. Tell them the truth. You're not leaving this world. Tell them what you really going to do. Now that you have this knowledge, how to get a soul from a body, you can survive without me. What does Melanie say? - She always wanted her life back. - Don't speak for me. - You're lying. I have to go. You don't have to decide right now. Think about it. Promise me to think about it. You're not leaving me. I can't stay. But I love you. I love you. Don't say it like you're saying goodbye. I love you in every way that I can. And I'll miss you the most. I miss the future I might have had with you. You're willing to sacrifice that? - Sometimes we have to make sacrifices. - No. I can't let you go. Let me talk to Melanie. - She's not there right now. She stepped into the other room. so I can kiss you. I really can't talk you out of it? No, it's time. I want to die. If you'd lived a millennium. always in a body of another you might feel the same way yourself. - Wanda, my sister. - Yes, sister? Please don't do this. Don't you wanna be with Jared? And Jamie? - It doesn't have to be this way. You don't have to die. You really could go to another world. The way you've been telling everyone. Thank you, but. by the time I got to the closest planet. You, Jamie, Jared, Ian. Everyone in this world I care about will be long dead. I don't want to go on without you. I love you, Mel. I love you. You were the purest soul, human or not. that I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you. Be happy, Mel. Be happy. After living so many lives. I finally found something to die for. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Wanda, Wanda, can you hear me? Where am I? Who am I? You're you. Hello, Wanda. Melanie? You might wanna see yourself. You still do that with your hair. - Doc, you broke your word. - They broke it for me. They made me keep you alive. But I told you I didn't want to take another life in any world. - You didn't. - We've been taking souls out of humans for a month now. But when we took the soul out of that body. She never woke up. - The body was dying. The only way to save her was to put you inside. You haven't killed a body. You've giving it life. I miss you in my head. What are you thinking, Wanda? Thinking how happy I am. It's a strange world. The strangest. Our world isn't like the other worlds they came to. The way they see it, human beings are just so. alien. But if one of them can find a way to live with one of us. I wonder. MONTHS LATER Seekers. No one gets taken. Everybody out. Seeker, I. - Everybody out. Now. A little bright out tonight, isn't? You're human. Human. Human. Not all human. Are you their prisoner? Yes. - No. I'm not their prisoner. I'm their friend. They're human. Human as you. - We thought we were the last survivors. - So did we. Until we found three other groups. Now four. I thought I was the only one who switched sides. I guess you never know where you are going to find your home. Simply Releases Toppers Simply The Best Extracted Proudly Presents Translated by Simply Releases Toppers Jolly, Aegis and JR Jansen I'm sorry. Tom, it's time for your daily reminder . Just start whenever you want. My name is Tom Jacobs. Born on November 2, 1972. My parents called Mark and Judith. My wife's name is Abby. I would do anything for her voice. I am a prisoner in a homemade prison. I'm bored again Minnie. - What would you like to do now Tom? Let's go somewhere. - Move, six minutes to implement. What now? He is there to do? Well it happens. He was very excited. The end of living in garages and beg for scholarships. Remember when I asked you first? I said, "trust me they are going to pay." And then you said that you had a boyfriend. - I never said that. Not true. - Okay, I'm wrong. What is it? - Open it. This we can not afford. - Not yet. But they will. I want you to have it tonight. I want you with me. Both of you. Five minutes Tom. - We have an offer. That is fantastic. - Let's not get too excited. They want to know how exactly the machine. What about false memories? The machine behaves like a polygraph. It looks difference between real and fake. It is difficult after a brain washing. But I have a solution. If the person is brainwashed and he has a latent memory. So hypnosis, cult stuff or something. The machine checks that first and if that is not there then the real memory. Listen, the customer has an idea. Imagine that you can go to other people's memories ? Why would you do that? - Where do I start? Control of abused children. Alzheimer. I'm glad you understand the function. Richard, I was clear about what I wanted. I'm just saying. - Sell my machine, nothing else. I tried. This is what they came up with. Who came along then? - Everyone. You get the money you do not expect unless you compromises. If you just want to help people you you just for free. What do they offer? It is unethical. You built this machine to traumas to find. That does not change, it still can. - And that should you decide? With the knowledge I have? Course. - So it begins. We burst of debt and want a family. It'll be okay. - I deserve more than that. Relapse occurs in three minutes. I come to bring you money. Enough to start? Yeah, that's enough. But who invest in this? - Someone who understands the possibilities. Remember that at the end of the day you have the rights and control. He has a few questions. The machine I used seemed good. Why we build a new one? Upgrades. With the current program should someone still send. You should be able to go where you want once you're inside. So I dive in memory. - Can you hear me, Richard? Yeah, I hear you Tom. - How it works? No, memories are first sorted. So we create a virtual command post in the memory of the patient. How should the starting point look like? - Maybe like this place? this house? - Yes, until we have something different. something more interesting? - Yes. I start the capture. We need one voice. - I can do it. What? - Why do not we a little style? Maybe an actress hire? Since they love. Do you think my voice has no style? - No. How was that? - Well, we go to the Z and then we're done. How does it look? Really attractive. - I mean the voice Romeo. Same there. Your memory is completed, Tom. Your memory is completed, Tom. - Let's go. So I'm at the start point and I find a memory where I want? And then I'm there? Is it that simple? - It's so simple. How far can you go back in memory? - As far as memory permits. Limits loom if you on the border of memory comes. The world consists of things that are unreal. The machine generates them randomly. Things and people. Self leaves no trace behind. Then the last question, how do we get out? - The user makes out. And if something goes wrong? We're working on. Minnie? Destroy yourself please. destruct in five, four. three, two, one. Goodbye Tom. destruct failed. Remember that I'm not evil. Should I get a diagnosis? How long have I been caught Minnie? - Four years, two months, three days. Are you ready? I do not know if I have a life outside this place . Or anyone know that I'm alive. Hello? Honey, it's Richard.

I love you. - I love you. you stay awake for me? Where do you want it? - Put it down simply. What's this? Who is your investor? - It's complicated. Make it easier than. Who is that? Arthur Kennison, from prison. They want to memory suspects go. So you know whether they are guilty. - Would willingly go? No, if it works, it becomes mandatory. Stylish 180-degree turn.

I want to give you a chance. - Nonsense, you give yourself a chance. Okay, maybe I'm looking to something important. But you have to understand something. You're not the only one who is working on. You're the first but how long will that take? here I had another idea. - Forget your ideas but. It's all about control. Think you can take their money without consequences? How long have you been at man? Think about it. Think about your family, Tom. Mr. Jacobs? Are we still doing this? Let's begin. Who we enter? - We caught him recently. His name is Anthony Willis. His father is a murderer for the Mafia, a zero. What has he done? - He's a junkie. He was home and got an SMS from his girl goes to her sister. and kills her. Apparently. He had a blackout, he says.

Willingness and expendable. It seems like a nice guy. Just a sedative. The process does not hurt. Maybe not for me. It's a wild state there. It takes a few seconds.

The memory is over, Tom. that we had imagined. He took methadone to self soothe phoned his father and left. So he lied about not remember? Perhaps unaware. Junkies often have blackouts. That explains why he convinced that he is innocent. I must say I am very impressed , Tom. Get me out of here now, Gary. Goodbye, Tom. What the hell? - What would you like to do now? Gary, I'm back at the beginning. That's strange. I try again. Goodbye, Tom. Hello, Tom. What would you like to do now? It did not work. - What happens? What happens? - The extraction does not work.

I've said 100 times that dog is stupid. Give daddy a beer. Look at me. Do you see me? Anthony. Thank you, boy. He looked at me Minnie. I'm sure. The process is repeated three times. Your theory seems to be impossible. What was so special with memory? that particular time? Minnie, what time was it when I said that Anthony saw me? I can see the exact time of not currently determination. No, the real time reality. The time was 4:15, 15 July. I want you to show what Anthony at that exact moment did. scanning short-term memory. Look. He sees me, right? The lights are about five minutes. You were thinking of that memory. You thought of the memory, at the same time I in you. active memory. So he saw me, Minnie. I can not verify your theory, Tom. - You do not. ANTHONY'S PICTURES I have to meet him again. Minnie, I need to see the memory most used. I can not recall memories by frequency of use. and frequency of words? Something he thinks a lot. In a therapy session, for example? Search. I think about it all the time. I was with a friend.

Not against her. Nobody can see except me. If no suffering. I do not deserve it. - I give it, because I want you deserve. see it as a contribution to the 'new' you. You are at the end of this remembrance come, what do you do now? We wait here. Keep repeating this reminder, until he shows up. How long have I been here, Minnie? - Two weeks, Tom. You can see me. You can see me, right? you recognize me? My name is Tom Jacobs. Minnie, you see this, I'm not hallucinating? He hears me. Talk to me, I know you can hear me. Talk to me. What? - Enough. What? Talk to me, what did you say? - I said enough. What the hell you on? What are you doing, Tom? We wait. Welcome back. Can you hear me? - Yes. Well, that's great. It is very important that you understand everything, what I'm saying. I've been here four years prison. My wife's name is Abby Jacobs. I can still remember her phone. If you want me to leave here, then you call her and tell where I am. She was suspicious, so I'll tell you everything, what to say to her. If we lose another way, then come back to this place, because I will wait. okay? - Yeah, I was just lost in thought. I hope you're not wrong idea. But this is our third date. Maybe it was not a good idea. No, I've just had a rough day. Do you understand me? know what? Let us arrange another time. I look at my work schedule and call you then. That sounds fine. Hello? Am I speaking with Abby Jacobs? - Yes, I speak it. My name is Anthony Willis. Can I help you? I have with your spouse spoken. creep. If you think you're funny, let's see if police also found. Your father died of a heart attack, when you was 23. Tom was your friend. You could not bear how your dad a chest covered, so you ran to the beach. Tom came to you and wanted not leave when you asked. You hid under the sheets and he talked against you until the sun went down. During early that morning he you to marry. And you told him that he the worst timing ever. And you asked him why he a scatterbrain like you wanted to marry. And he said he took what he could get , as long as you but was. If only the smallest part. That was enough. I saw the whole conversation. I can see everything you've done seconds earlier, in the short term memory. She believed you. Which means they will come, to talk to you. There are still a few things, you should tell her. I think I know what went wrong that day and how we can solve. I know everything about you. You played football as a child. You were at your uncle named. Your friend gave you your first painkiller, when you were only 14 years old. I have the best and the worst of you seen. I've seen your crimes. But I also regret seen. This is your chance to do the right thing. Will you help me? You think I want you hanging around? I want to believe you. I really do. Maybe there's another way to explain what you know. So I have a question. If you really can talk to him, then you can answer this. What do you know? His nickname for me. You have five minutes, ma'am. - Thank you. Are you still there? I can not just talk to him. We a place where we meet. I'm sure his memory now runs, give me an answer. He can see us? - He can see what I see. This is his daughter, Donna. Take me to the meeting, Minnie. - Localize. Can you see him or not? - I see him yet. I have no idea what I'm doing here. - Wait. If you tried to make me stupid happen, then you are successful. Wait, give me a second. Birdie. He calls you Birdie. reminder that I can live forever. Okay, write this down. If I'm still here, that means, that the chip is still inside you. I think the self-destruction the chip is damaged. I have searched and he was gone. - Not everything, according to Tom. Why was it not seen on the scan? - It only responds to the metal parts. prototypes of my chips, are made of silicon. The new ones are made of monocrystalline, why you saw them. In my haste, I have the scanner never reprogrammed. It had taken just minutes. It's not your fault. - And now what? I have permission to Tom from the hospital to pick up. Anthony And then? Richard. - Richard? He can still help me with the prison paper. Abby, it's Richard. I've just spoken to them. He must stay here. I could not get out. - Does that mean it's over? I said I could get him out. - I do not understand. I even have my priorities. I send you his information. Mr. Kennison? - There's nothing I can do, sorry. push him into a corner, because there will be nobody else for your husband fight. I own a farm near here. I would order a transfer questions. and some guards who managed to keep their mouths . If I just was motivated. What do you mean by that? machine, Mrs. Jacobs. What do you think about him to give me? I understand that this is a difficult decision for you. Then you know me yet. the Rule. I must be honest. It's hard to unwind when I know you're watching. gets you out, you promise that you some things for yourself. You can feel lonely in the cell. I do not want people to judge me . I hate this place. Shall we choose another place? Come with me, wimp. - Nobody's stopping you. So you keep just sit and do nothing? Maybe I have just sitting here, while I look at you. Okay. Last chance . Come, wimp. Come in.. That was long. Nice place. We came here, whenever we could. I think we now four months together. Have you been here before? That's hard to say. My memory is cloudy. I do not know what to me, or your hear. This is definitely mine. This is a. better place. you remember the last time, that we met? You said it would not hurt. Since then I have pain. Why did you do that thing built? I do not remember. I guess because I wanted to help people. So they deal with the past could come and their traumas could handle. world a better place. That sounds like a cliché, right? Somewhere along I've lost my focus. It was less about what I could give and more about what I could get. Do you regret it? every day. You can not change the past. Maybe you do next invention? I definitely buy a ticket. I'm going tonight. They let me leave this place. - Just like that? Where fuck are you going? They bring me to a place before surgery. They say it's painless. Computers and machines will the most work. I must stay overnight and the next day I can go again. If he tries anything, we're outside. And then what? A transfer to another prison. - Great. That sounds great. - That guy needs my help. I've already told you years ago that you not to join that program should do. I tried to prove my innocence. - Your innocence? That night you called me, you told me everything. You remember that maybe not, but I do . Dad, something bad happened. I had to pick. I watched my son a overdose had in the back. while I was tidying up his mess. I kept my mouth shut, against the police for you. You're right where you are now. And now they bring you to an unknown place. I will not use again. - Do you believe it yourself, Anthony? There is only a weak moment and you need lapse into your old habits. I try to do the right thing. You have in your whole life never done properly. And now you're mad, right? And I'm a bad father, because I do not believe you. I have saved more than I can count. But I'm done, Anthony. You may hate me, but all I 've done, I've done for you. Do you still you're innocent? - Yes. Prove it. He was right. What is that thing? This is what I need to build. Each chip has a source frequency. And this send a signal every second, to that frequency to intercept. If we are connected to the signal Tom, then we need you. to tell us in what he's memory. Tell him that he should stay. Then we filter that memory by the device. We bring the body of Tom inside and do the swap. Are you sure it will work? - I think the same chance of success. but it's the best chance we have. - How long? We begin within one hour and whole process will take about four hours. Basically what it will take longer. What do you mean? - You need me. I have a request for Tom. I know that he can see. Tom, I have good cooperated do not you think? I want something from you. I want to know what's on the night of the murder happened. I've seen what happened. You killed your girlfriend. There is more happened than I my own life saved by the police. I want proof. I want to prove that they were wrong. We do not have time for. - Then it time. I first want to know if he has listened and agree. So Tom. I await your answer. You lied to me. You want me here for the rest of your life I? You killed her, is not that enough? - I'm not a murderer. Start with her. - You were angry and you let her suffer? I thought you could see everything? - Acts, no emotions. So you see only a picture book. You do not know what they meant to me. You can not bluff. You're not an angel. Every time you hurt someone, or threatened, I saw it. That his actions. - Who has not done bad things? You only know my past. I know my suffering. Really, who are past do you? Of the person against whom I talk. or the person with the needle in his arm? The police and your father think you've done , even I think you did. So we have it all wrong? The evidence is wrong? I'm wrong? You did it, Anthony. So what's the point? The point is that something else happened that night. There was another man and I want to know who he is. A random memory search, is looking for a needle in a haystack. I'll tell you everything I can remember, I will lead you. Even if there was someone else, then you have still killed her. not accidental. Not in self-defense. Create the resource if the goal is horrible? - For me. you think there is no price for your freedom would be, Tom? I would have thought that I was dealing with a decent man. Well, we all make mistakes, not true. Maybe I for people like you a guinea pig. but now you do what I say because I'm the only chance you get home. You have until tomorrow morning before being transferred. If you want my help, you must first help me. Abbey, there is a small delay. You do not have to worry. Is Tom there? - Yeah, he's about an hour. Good. Stay there and I'll call you when it again goes smoothly. Let's begin. Tell me about Adrienne. Everything you know. We had two year relationship. She was not really easy. From the beginning not. Family Problems. Suicide Attempt 16. When we first met, she by me to the hard stuff. In the beginning we klooiden but what. But then. She was my whole world. And I wish we stopped because we were killing each other. But she could not. matter how hard I tried, I could not help her . And one day she just left. She did not say why. She took her phone anymore. And then I became in a downward spiral. And the next time I saw her, she was dead . We have a signal. We are waiting only for you two. The clock is ticking. You said there that night something else happened? Tell me everything you can remember . Minnie, get ready for this to locate. I remember I woke up in the bath after I heard broken glass. I had a bottle of pills and had beaten back Adrienne's gun at me. I've got a splitting headache. Do not know how long I was unconscious. The house is unknown to me. I remember that pictures the chimney stood. In the guest room was a sofa and a TV . Do the program stops. And on the bookshelf stood a clock. I heard noise. Turned around. Blackout. I did not even have time to my pistol draw. Minnie, put the attacker down. Alternates. Everywhere alternates. The memory true but for 5%. Nothing contextueels. You do not even know who or where. - But the memory is real? Yes. - Then you have to keep digging. Come to it. Look again. - Is three times is not enough? Everywhere alternates. Even the magazines. The attacker is a dead end. There is simply not enough. What do you want me to do? I never said anything about magazines. - Does not matter. They were there. You remember them, just not what they were. Now that you mention it, I remember them me. They were porn magazines. No, that I had seen. You are confused by another reminder. Is that so? Minnie, how accurate is this picture? - 100% Reminders. That you learn during your PhD. You have a seven course meal. You remember nothing. But when I say that you had steak, you remember that you also had potatoes. memory unravels. You just need a little helping. Anthony, this is not enough. You must share with me your thoughts. We must do this together. So sit here and concentrate. I tell you everything I see and you have something to teach. It's all there. I just bring it forward. The first thing is. This was not a porno mag. What was it, Anthony? It was about tattoos. The rest also. Right. Good. There was suddenly something else visible. A purple bottle? A perfume bottle. There were many at that sink. Good. What color was the carpet, Anthony? Red, I think. Or Orange. - No, it was red. The towels also. Red and black. And part? - A drawing of a train. shower curtain. That is the first what I say. It was weird. There was a strange pattern. Stains. Indeed. The whole bathroom was clean. Everything fits together. You remember. Let's see what else you remember. Minnie, do me the pass rates. - Memory, 25% accurate. Anthony, here's something. A photo in the hall. It is a drawing. Soldiers. 35% accurate. Anthony, there is now a whole new room. - There is a pink towel on the bench. photos on the wall. A hat. A coffee table with a book on it. bookshelf. The TV is on. - There are cartoons. Anthony, the clock changes the time ever. What time is it, Anthony? Come on. Think. What time is it? - 1:35 pm. Minnie, set this reminder again. Anthony, if you do all those little things can remember. I'm sure you also remember the great . why he was in her house? - No idea. But the memory is real. And the time. The cop said when she died. What if he did? - Anthony, I saw you do it. Maybe you're wrong. - I'm not wrong. I did my part, now you must do your part. Tell him Garrett that I will wait for our meeting. A deal is a deal.

Should you feel any better, they really wanted to quit. Really. The problem was that it was my drug. I told her that if she ever would break our agreement. that I would shoot her through her head. So thank you my dirty work have been refurbished. Minnie, locate everything what is happening now. Minnie? - My name is Minnie. What would you do? I said, locate everything what is happening now. to locate. Subject damaged. - Why did you do it? I was so close. I was almost there. System Fault. Talk to me, coward. Look at me. You gotta get me out of here, Anthony. There is something wrong with Minnie. You promised. What you gonna do now? Look at me. What will you do now? I'm going to do what's best for me.

What do you do? Anthony, come here. Look at me. Tell me what you wanted to do. Come on, Tom. Anthony, tell me what to do. Are you there last? Goodbye, Tom. Can you take it? - Do you sometimes somewhere else? Last chance . My name is Tom Jacobs. Born on 12 November 1972. My parents are Mark and Judith. My wife called Abbey. I would give anything to her again my name hearsay. My father fought in the war. He did not believe in psychology. or post-traumatic stress. He always said that war was just like going to the beach. You'll come home with some sand. This was on his 15th birthday. Rex. I remember that dog as well. It seems like mine was. It was a show dog that I had received. Rex was a show dog? Basel What now? He could not even sit on command. Pooped under the house. Chewed on the furniture. You sound just like my son. - What are you talking about? I gave him away because another trainer gave me a good offer. I told Anthony that he did difficult and the thing under pooped. If your child says something often enough, he believe. That dog behaved badly. Anthony saw it. I saw it. Anthony saw nothing. Rex was a great dog. you remember that right? You remember it right? I grab another beer. You too? - No, thanks. Dad, what if I let it sit? - Through repetition, Anthony. If your child says something often enough, he believe. Anthony, I have so often said. This dog is oerdom. When it comes to brainwashing the line is blurred, but I can work around. What is brainwashing? Hypnosis, cult programming. Can it be defined? Bad people you edit. Maybe Anthony poorly conditioned to think that his dog was stupid. Sit. Good. You can make a thousand ways manipulate. Some are as innocent as a father with his son talk. Anthony could become convinced, where one could still convince him? From what the police said. - Look what you've done. To his father's disappointment. - Does my word nothing? What he could be more than you believe? - I'm sorry. I can not be part of your life . I'm sorry. We received an anonymous tip. Someone saw his truck stop on a bridge. near the crime scene around two o'clock in the morning. You gave the anonymous tip. You have that letter, right? - What are you talking about? not play games with me. You set him up so what do you know? That does not matter anymore. - Yes, for me it out. Anthony has called you that night. What did he tell you? Yeah, he called me up. but what he stammered. Sounded like another lie. Addicts who lie simply. How could you? It was your son. - There was no sensible word out. So you protected yourself? - I protected him. It was a matter of time before they would find him dead somewhere. When he awoke in the morning and said there was nothing he could remember. when I took my decision and I set him up. When I came out of jail, I kicked the habit. Do you have a child? Yes. - What would you have done? Guilt is a powerful thing. It is imperative . It is an obsession. And you have a choice. Whether you keep it down. or you can change. I think she thought she neither of them could do. Experimental project is further put. What if he can convince the people actually it works? I do not know why I let you go. Fixed force of habit.

Princess Ling Moy. You are incomparable. Superb. Please come back to us soon. Thank you, Mr Webster. Goodbye. Goodbye. How lovely. Isn't that beautiful? [ Door knocks ] Your manager. Come in, Morloff. As always. My friends and guests of the evening. Miss Joan Marshall. And her fiancée, Mr Ronald Petrie. Ling Moy is honoured. Your dancing bewitched us. May I too, congratulate you? Ling Moy shall endeavour to deserve this praise. I see you are staying at Mr Morloff's house until you leave for South America? Ah, Princess. The Petries are neighbours of ours. Oh, the charming white house? - Yes. The one next door. Now that you are free I hope we may see you often. I too .. dare hope for it. Goodnight, Princess. Goodnight. I shall join you in a moment. - Right you are, Morloff. Is there any news of my father? He has arrived in London. - Is he at your house? He will be there tonight. And shall I see him? Undoubtedly. Now, now. Understand, Ah Kee. As a special worker for Scotland Yard, you are first rate. In fact I am sorry you can't join us officially. But this time, you are barking up the wrong tree. These records prove that Fu Manchu died twenty years ago. His body was not found. He never appeared again. He is here, in London. I saw him tonight. A resemblance? - Perhaps. But if I happen to be right. Petrie should be warned. Yes. If you are right. Get me Sir John Petrie's house. What? Are you sure? The telephone wire has been cut. Hobbs. - Yes sir? Get me two cars and half a dozen men. We leave immediately for the Petrie house. Right, sir. I wish I could find a word to describe her. Exotic. That's the word. And .. She's intriguing, if you know what I mean, father. He knows very well what you mean, Ronald. At your age, he was very much like you. Even more so, I should say. Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm intruding. You want something, Rogers? No, sir. Well that is, you see, I blundered. You what? - Sir, it's my glasses. I don't see well without them. And I left them in the study when I came in here a few moments ago. To get a copy of Black Beauty. But instead, I got .. I've got .. I've got it. Oh, I've typed those notes, Sir John. - Very good, Rogers. I'll look over them at once. - Yes, sir. Well, goodnight. Mr Morloff. - Goodnight, Rogers. Goodnight, Rogers. That is for Sir John. - Very well, Flinders. Oh. Excuse me. Sir John, may I see you a moment, privately? Certainly, Rogers. Come up to my study. Oh, there they are. Oh yes. There. Oh very good. Very good, Rogers. In fact, I'd say .. splendid. Now, what about your private business? - Oh. Well I have a problem, sir. - Oh? By all means, marry the girl. Sir, it is not that sort of a problem. Oh, not that sort? Well, what sort? Well you see, in opening your letters. I've tried to keep from you, advertisements and that sort of thing. Quite right. - And .. Well then, I'm justified and thank you very much. That was easily settled. Well, I wouldn't have bothered you, but you see. This was exceptional. Advertisements? They must be. They're not letters. - Let me see them. No, no. I've annoyed you quite enough and they're really all far too serious. Rogers. These are warnings of death. It's appalling. Why in heaven's name didn't you mention this before? Call Sir Basil Courtney at once. Hello, hello. The phone is dead. The wire is cut. Rogers. Telephone from Morloff's place. Ask Sir Basil to come here immediately. But say nothing of this to Lady Petrie or the others. Now hurry, hurry. As fast as you can. Fu Manchu coming here? From the grave? I <i>am</i> here, Doctor. Born, ready and risen. Ha-ha-ha-ha. You! The murderer of my father and his father before him. What more can you want? To wipe the slate clean. May I sit down? My advanced years, you see. In the twenty years I have fought to live. The thought of killing you and your son has been my dearest nurse. I have used my time. To perfect the most .. Ingenious .. death. For you both. - You'll never do it. You murdering madman. My first precaution .. naturally. You devil. If you dare to lay a finger on my boy. If you dare to hurt .. to hurt .. I will .. Do you feel the atrophy of the throat muscle? A unique poison has been mixed in your tobacco. A most mischievous formula. As witnessed. You see? Your mind is completely .. Under my control. Walk .. Sir John. [ Buzzer ] Is Sir John at home? - Yes, Sir Basil. Hobbs .. you and Bentley stop here. - Yes, sir. Hello, Sir Basil. - Where is your father, Ronald? In the study. - Thank you. I'd like to see him. Why Sir Basil, what's wrong? - No cause for alarm, Lady Petrie. I just want a word or two with Sir John. - I'll fetch him down now. Why, father. Stop .. Sir John. Fu Manchu! If you love Sir John, do not shoot. The shock of a pistol report. Would kill him instantly. Oh, don't. Ah, Lady Petrie. The accumulated greetings of 20 years. My beloved ones were killed before my eyes. In like manner I shall now <i>cancel the debt</i>. Walk, Sir John. My first victim now descends towards you. His life hanging by a strained thread. Which my vengeance now .. severs! John! You, Ronald Petrie. Are the remainder of the forfeit. And your life too .. is mine. Oh Ronald, you'll be killed! After him! Sir Basil, he's dead. Bentley, Flinders. Help me carry him in there. - Yes, sir. This passage leads to the way out. Did he double back this way, sir? No. Hobbs .. I'm going to put an extra guard around the house. You warn the local Police. - Yes, sir. Mr Morloff. I heard a shot as I came through the garden. What's happened? Sir John has been killed. Master. Is my daughter here? - Yes, master. Then make haste. Prepare the .. altar room. Bring Ling Moy to me there. The Great Lord awaits his daughter. Your noble father will receive you. My flower daughter. My honoured father. May your days be laughing songs. And may the blood of your father. Course warmly in your veins. For within the hour, he will be gathered. To his revered ancestors. - No, no. I've only just found you. Noble father. The emblem of the great house of Fu. As a child, you cried yourself to sleep. Over its tragic fairy story. So at last, my daughter. The story .. is true. Mother and brother. Murdered by a Petrie. Yours .. Yours is the noble house of Fu. Then you? I, your father .. Am Fun Manchu. Live, live. Divine father. Infamous father. I sent you away. Into the occidental world. To keep you from me until I should deserve your homage. Instead. You now witness my shame. Great spirits beyond. I come to you. Crawling in the dust. Death lays its hands upon me. And my sacred work is unfinished. That Petrie still lives. The dishonour .. Is burned upon my forehead. Master. Let this unworthy slave finish the sacred work. Only one of the House of Fu can redeem our honour. The blood is mine. The hate is mine. The vengeance shall be mine. My flower daughter. The knife would wither your petal fingers. I call to my ancestors. If only thou had granted me another son. Father. Father! <i>I</i> will be your son. I will be your son! Swear .. man-daughter. To deliver the soul of Ronald Petrie to me. To our ancestors. I swear. Sovereign spirit. You have answered my deepest prayer. I have a son! Chair. Do not leave me, father. Death must not take you. Yes. And my death. Will make you innocent in their eyes. For I shall be discovered. In an attempt to kill you. - Father! It will bring the boy near you in sympathy. And through the tunnel. My good servant Morloff, is inducted in their house. You will have a hidden approach to the hated Petrie. When you are ready to strike. Lu Chung. - Yes, master? Tell the Amah .. to call for help. Say. The Princess is being murdered. When they enter .. and shoot me down. You will thank them. No! You will .. thank .. them. And now. Goodbye. My son, at such a time .. Should know how to say a courageous farewell. Goodbye. My honoured father. Hobbs. - Yes, sir? Coming, sir. Not a trace of him out here. - Well, what have you done? I've thrown a cordon round the house aided by the Police. Send for some more to increase the guard. Put some of them back .. [ Female screams! ] What's that? Come inside quick! Come inside. They're killing her! This way. Come quick! Stay down here, Bentley. You murderer. - You see, he's through. Ling Moy. My Princess, are you safe? This is her bedroom. What is this man doing here? Wait. He's dead. Are you alright? Fu Manchu killed my father. And Ling Moy graciously. Thanks you. For his death. I understand. I'm sorry. You are very kind. Ronald. Thanks to Ah Kee. This is the last page. Of a terrible record. Father. I will .. I will. Why not tear up the South American contract and remain just here with me? Could I tear my beauty, too? Ling Moy. These last two months have been very, very beautiful. And I've had terrible regrets over your going. Will you? Yes .. many. Then chuck everything and stay. If I stay. Would my hair ever become golden curls? And my skin ivory like Ronald's? It's strange. I prefer yours. I shall never forget your hair and your eyes. It's only a passing fascination. It <i>was</i> fascination. The leopard and the deer stroll too amicably together. By talking much, she learns much. The Chinese heart is very constant Ronald. It might be sadly wounded. In one of your western affairs. But don't you realize .. - Ronald .. Ronald. Oh, Ronald. Alright, Joan. You will let me drive you into town? - Yes. In half an hour, then? Here we are, Joan. Tea is ready. Of course it is the un-spiced, English variety. Oh, I don't think I'll have any, thanks. You see, wait, dear. I promised to drive Ling Moy into town. - But you didn't bother to explain. Oh but Joan, I just happened to say I'd drive her. It's a happy coincidence, isn't it that you .. Promise to do the very thing you preferred. Yes, but Joan. Lu Chung humbly offers that the time is short. I am aware. Perhaps Ling Moy divides her strength between duty .. And the advice of the heart. I am giving him a beautiful illusion. Which I shall crush. - I pray that it is so. For one foot cannot stand on two boats. Lu Chung. You are insolent. I just echo the thought of your people. Who demand some word from you. They are even more insolent. What shall I tell them? Tell them the orders shall be executed tonight. Death will first awaken Petrie from sleep. And then end this lingering horror with a slow knife. Tell them that. [ Buzzer ] That would be Mr Ah Kee at your door. Did he follow you from Limehouse? - No doubt. But may he not call here at any time? He has been dedicated to guard you. And loves his work. What does he know of you? My unsavoury reputation only. Mr Ah Kee. Lu Chung, he must not find you here. Lottery tickets. Send him in. Come in. Princess. Ling Moy is abased to be found at a sacred vice. Lottery tickets. These I keep, Lu Chung. You may go. You prosper, Lu Chung? It is a vile calling. I preach against it. Won't you sit down? Thank you. How did you come to know him? He came to know me. With his tickets. I do not trust him. - Is there danger? Hardly. I am just over-eager for your safety. Perhaps the personal interest makes me so. I should not have guessed it from your quiet manner. Ling Moy. I have watched you every night at the theatre, silently. And dreamed of our closer friendship. Let us remember. There are few days left .. for friendship. With all my humble heart. Upstairs. Third door on the left. Who are you, please? Who are you? Petrie. Petrie. Why, Mr Ah Kee. Whatever in the world has happened to you? Did you see anyone? No, no. Is Petrie dead? - Petrie? Why I .. Ronald .. Ronald! Are you alright, now? Turn on the light. - The light? Oh dear, dear. I hope I can find them. Won't you please tell me what's happened? I don't know exactly. Ah Kee. What's up? What's the matter? There was an attempt on your life tonight. What do you mean? Get Scotland Yard at once. - Yes. Ah Kee, you are hurt. - Never mind about me. As long as you are safe. Hello .. hello, give me Scotland Yard. No, no, no. Scotland Yard! What .. what's that? Well, I have every reason for shouting. The circumstances are distinctly of a shout-able nature. What? What's that? Well, my dear young woman, let me tell you a brisk something. If you are going to .. Will you please give me Scotland Yard? Thank you. - Wouldn't you have thought .. Was I really shouting? Sir Basil, please. Sir Basil? Ah Kee. Ronald, what is it? - Sorry, mother. Yes, just as I thought. Send a few men immediately. Yes. Alright for the moment. Mr Ah Kee, what's happened? There were intruders tonight, Lady Petrie. Fu Manchu .. I feared it. I told Sir Basil. Ling Moy. Ronald, where are you going? Fu Manchu attempted to kill her, too. Ah Kee, her life may be in danger tonight. Right, Petrie, I'll go with you. Ronald, don't go out. Ronald. Where are you going? - Well, I ought .. I <i>will</i> go with them. I don't think they'll need you. Lady Petrie, I feel to a great extent <i>I</i> am responsible for this tragedy. I would gladly lay down my life. Thank you, but I think you'd better stay with me now. That's right. Those intruders might still be lurking about. You don't really think so, do you? Princess. It is accomplished? [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Morloff, we've got to see you for a minute. Come in, gentlemen. Someone entered our house tonight. - Yes. Agents of Fu Manchu. Fu Manchu? I can't believe it. You must be mistaken. - Is Ling Moy safe? Of course. There was no disturbance here. Are you sure? Amah. Amah. You know of course, why they fear for her? Certainly. Amah. You have just been with the Princess? Yes .. she is sleeping. I was sure of it. That's all. I think it would be unwise to wake her. Oh quite right. It would alarm her. I am posting a guard around the Petrie house. If you wish, Mr Morloff. Would you, please. Just a few men on the grounds outside my place. I'll keep extra watch indoors. Righto .. goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you, both. Goodnight, Morloff. Goodnight. Princess .. at least tell me. Was his dying as gratifying as I told you? Lu Chung. Morloff .. you are not permitted in my room. I take the liberty. I have just spoken to Petrie. - But .. It was not done? No. You, a weakling? Why didn't you strike? I delayed, then heard a noise. You love him? Remember. Your father said that if you faltered .. A weakness overcame me. Pah. It is wisely written. A stupid son is better than a crafty daughter. It is written. It is written. It should be written that a slave do reverence to a daughter of the light. Night prayers. I will burn this incense of repentance. At her prayers. The master provided it. For the weak half of her, which is woman. Go. I can't kill him .. I love him. I would rather kill myself. A half-fit maiden. Would pour her blood. On love's author. Yes. It would be her release. Her petty torment would then be ended. And for the peace of this one miserable soul. The souls of our ancestors will forever burn in the fire of dishonour. Pah! There is your place. Make peace .. with your father. My father. Give me understanding. [ Fu Manchu ] "<i>We are not resting</i>." "<i>We shall never rest</i>." "<i>Until you kill him .. who remains</i>." "<i>Ling Moy</i>." "<i>You must</i>." "<i>Kill</i>." Forgive me, majestic father. I will. I will. Your commendable fears may rest. It shall be accomplished. Your weakness last evening has made the task quite difficult. It is necessary only to lure Petrie here. Pardon? Mr Ah Kee is the obstacle. It was he whom I overpowered in the hallway last night. And from this moment on, Mr Ah Kee and Petrie will be inseparable. And if I should lure Mr Ah Kee away? Hmm, that is a desired convenience. I have taken the oath of a son. But I shall again become the daughter of Fu Manchu. And a woman. When the branch creaks, the leaf shakes. Lu Chung is glad to hear. At nightfall then. With the aid of Mr Morloff .. we shall. Checkmate. Well, really. - See for yourself, old man. Couldn't we go out in the air for a bit? It wouldn't be safe at night. Bored? Bored? Oh, not with you, Ah Kee. Mr Ah Kee. Mr Morloff on the telephone for you, sir. Morloff? - Yes, sir. Will you excuse me a minute? - Surely. Hello? Oh .. just a moment, Mr Ah Kee. Hello .. Mr Ah Kee? Hello, Ling Moy. Forgive me. I am sailing tomorrow. I've called to say goodbye. Oh, Ling Moy. I must see you tomorrow before you go. I am afraid there will not be time. But tonight then, for a moment? Ling Moy, please I must. Ling Moy will be waiting. Alright. I will be right over. I am going to the Morloff house. Keep your eye on him while I'm gone. Oh, certainly. And .. if anything should happen. You will phone for me immediately. Rather. - I won't be long. My Mistress will be here soon. She bids you wear this robe of your Eastern rank. Your heart still bears the soft elegance of China. I kneel. Not to our own customs. But to your beauty. Come. Sit beside me here. Oh .. oh. Have you found it yet? - Yes. No. It all came of having indecently exposed the Queen. Here. Indecent is the word. - Yes .. isn't it. Petrie .. Petrie! Ling Moy .. has been kidnapped. What's that? - Lu Chung has got her. Find Ah Kee. Ah Kee has followed them. He said to phone Scotland Yard and raid Lu Chung's place. Raid Lu Chung's place? - Hurry man. It may be too late. Flinders. Get my coat, will you. - Yes, sir. Petrie .. I trust you with this. - Yes. I must go back. Hurry, please. - Yes of course, old man. Rogers. Get Sir Basil. Tell him to meet me at Lu Chung's with raiding squad. Understand? - You understand, Flinders? They're to meet Mr Ronald at Lu Chung's with the raiding party. Telephone Miss Marshall and ask her to come here and stay with mother. Telephone Miss Marshall? I told <i>you</i> to telephone, Rogers. Well, I am going with you, sir. I have a score to settle. Don't be absurd. Now just wait a minute. I'll just get my muffler and a weapon. Now make those calls, Flinders. Make those calls. Yes, sir. Get me Scotland Yard please. Have you made the calls? - I'm just making them, sir. Well hurry, hurry. - Yes, sir. They come. Here is Mr Petrie, sir. Hurry, Sir Basil. We may be too late. - Is Ah Kee with you? No. He went ahead. He may be inside. You are too late I hope. My hat, Rogers! Go home! Not until I deal a blow or two. Look out, sir. Hobbs! Check the back door. And where does that lead? Stay where you are. Go down here. [ Chinese language ] I'm coming! Come on, Mr Ronald. Here they are. That way! Come on. There he is! [ Female scream! ] Ling Moy! Ling Moy! Ling Moy! Ling Moy! Hobbs! Hobbs! Listen .. I'm inside. This looks like a false lead. - That's my opinion, sir. Where is Petrie? - He wasn't with me, sir. He went the other way, with Dixon. I'll call him. Dixon .. Dixon. Dixon! - Coming, sir. He's coming up. Dixon. Where is Petrie? - Why .. I thought he came back up here, sir. He's been trapped. Carney, get every available man you can and follow us immediately. Right, sir. [ Chinese singing: ] [ Chinese singing: ] If we were always together. Would not Ah Kee grow weary of everlasting beauty? No. In his paradise. He would grow as fat as the Buddha. That's too fat. I should stop loving Ah Kee. And only pray to him. Then .. lean in hunger. For more and more we are beauties. Lin Moy. I cannot bear to see you go away from me. Ling Moy. You do love me? Too much, Ah Kee. Then you <i>will </i>let me take you away to China? To the land of our ancestors. Ling Moy. You do not answer. Is there a doubt? - No. Before I answer you. I shall go to the altar. And thank them for this gift. Then thank them too. In the name of Ah Kee. The fruit of your ingenious plan, Princess. Lu Chung, is all admiration. And this time, there will be no turning aside. And now. These clumsy fingers itch. To dispose of Mr Ah Kee. He will be put away until we are free of England tonight. Permanently put away, of course? - There is no need to kill. We must ensure our escape. - You may trust me for that. But Princes .. - I have spoken. Amah, the wine. Heaven smiled upon our fates. The greatness of the moment. Confuses Ah Kee. In this wine, we pledge our troth. Ah Kee pledges his love. And his life to Ling Moy. And in return .. He gives the <i>counterfeit</i> of love! Why have you poisoned the wine, and our love? It is an unworthy suspicion. What is Lu Chung doing here? What do you want with Petrie? Why is he lying senseless there? One answer will serve for everything. I am the daughter of Fu Manchu. You? You will not kill him. - By my sacred oath. But an oath .. should never have been sworn. I tell you to release him. That cannot be. - I warn you. I have a duty to Scotland Yard. Consider carefully before you leave to do it. If you try, and I'm forced to leave. They will kill you. I do not want your blood on my hands. I cannot delay. But I see before me. The magnet of your house. We shall search out these things, Ah Kee. Remember only, that you love me. Whoever I am. I always hated the name of Fu Manchu. Forget that hate. I am a woman. Where is your hatred against our love? Against our eternal day together. It is the triumph of irony. That the only woman I have ever deeply loved. Should be born of blood that I loathe. Look into my eyes, Ah Kee. And see us already sailing home to China. To the place you know. Where the flowers smother the fields. Would you love .. a dishonoured Ah Kee? Forever. And I would forever despise him. Finish Petrie. You honest fool. It was not for myself, but for your own life that I played in love with you. You have chosen to die. Get him! Stand back, Morloff. Mr Morloff. Shush. What's happened? - Are you alone? Come here .. I need your help. Do not his manners plead for death? Tie him up. - But Princess. Quick Lu Chung. We waste time. Take him to the attic. - Yes. Chair. Now, we go to the cellar. Ronald .. Ronald. Ling Moy. I was afraid. Oh you are safe, then? What happened to me? Ling Moy rescued you. For her own. These lights they are .. Swimming in my brain. I've never seen you looking more softly beautiful. [ Female screams! ] That's Joan. What's she doing here? What's happening to her? [ Female screams! ] Answer me! What's happening to her? Can you think of her now? [ Female screams! ] Why is she screaming like that? You refuse the gift of Ling Moy's heart? Very well. I will take you to her. Follow me. Joan, where are you? Joan, what is it? Morloff, what's happening? Joan, my darling. What have they done to you? Oh, it's Morloff. Morloff! Why, you .. What's the meaning of this, Ling Moy? Are you mad? Look into my eyes. Set her free, do you hear me. Ling Moy. I can't believe such loathsome jealousy in you. No love now. No jealousy. Just merciless vengeance. You will understand when I tell you, Ronald Petrie. I am the daughter of Fu Manchu. You? You death tonight washes the stain from my house. Alright .. you can do what you like with me. But why do you hold Joan? Because you must have a thousand bitter tastes. Of death .. before you die. Tie him up. My vengeance is inspired tonight. You'll have first have the torture of seeing her beauty .. Eaten slowly away by this hungry acid. You wouldn't dare to that! Prepare. Flinders .. Flinders, see who that is. - Yes, milady. Lady Petrie .. has Ronald shown up yet? I thought he was with you. - Well he was. Rogers. - Oh, they've got Ronald. Go upstairs and don't worry. We are going to have a talk. With Mr Morloff. Come along, Hobbs. Mr Morloff, please. Go away. I am alone. - Oh. Nobody here? - Nobody. Do you believe her, sir? I think Morloff is in there. - Of course he is. She's a bad liar. No, no .. they may be watching us. We'll go to the Petrie House. And work from there. Come on. Great heavens! It's Ah Kee. That's alright, Ah Kee. Quick. They are killing them. Killing them.

Through the centuries, science has made man's lifetime bigger and the world smaller. Now the farthest corner of the Earth is as close as a pushbutton. And time has lost all meaning as manmade devices speed many, many times faster than sound itself. Here, near the top of the world, free men struggle with the elements to create some measure of defense to protect that self-same freedom. Distant Early Warning radar, sensitive electronic devices to detect the presence of objects in the sky, including bombing planes and guided missiles and rain clouds and homing pigeons. New radar installations must be calibrated by the flying of controlled test flights to check the accuracy of the equipment and to chart a detection profile of the area in order to pinpoint blind spots the radar cannot penetrate. Bravo 8035. Angels 9. Bravo 7540. Angels 9. Bravo 7045. Angels 9. Test Flight. Test Flight. This is Snowman Three. Give me a reading. Over. Snowman Three, this is Test Flight. Flying vector, 340 degrees from IP. Angels 10. Speed, 400. How do you read me? Over. Everything checks but the altitude, Mitch. We read you at Angels 9. Altimeter reads 10,000 on the nose. Better check the level on the antenna mount. Roger. How about Mademoiselle Mathematician? She got enough numbers to feed into her machines yet? Do you have all the information you need, Miss Caldwell? One more run, please. Low level coming in. One more, Mitch. Vector 105 degrees, low. Roger. Turning 180 degrees, low approach. This is Test Flight, over and out. I didn't know pilots were allowed to do things like that. Not Air Force pilots, you're right. But Mitch is an electronics engineer. He may work for the government, but, ma'am, he kinda makes his own rules. So does a three-year-old child until his mother spanks him. - Mother, dear mother, I'm ready if you are. - I must have left the switch on. An electronics engineer. A radar officer. A mathematician and systems analyst. A radar operator. A couple of plotters. People doing a job, well, efficiently. Serious, having fun. Doing a job. Situation, normal for the moment. Date, the 17th of the month. Sky cloudy, overcast. Visibility limited. Time, 1332 hours. A significant moment in history. A moment when an electronics engineer named Mitchell MacAfee saw something in the sky. Something that was almost the beginning of the end of life on this Earth. MacAfee reported instantly by radio the sighting of a UFO, an unidentified flying object. The radar officer replied that it was impossible. According to the radar scope, except for Mitch's plane, there wasn't a single, solitary object of any nature whatsoever. Nothing in the sky for a radius of hundreds of miles. MacAfee didn't care what the radar showed or didn't show. He knew what he saw with his own eyes. And he was determined to get a better look. MacAfee turned, and so did the unidentified flying object heading toward him. There was no mistaking the urgency in MacAfee's voice. Something, he didn't know what, but something as big as a battleship had just flown over and past him at speeds so great he couldn't begin to estimate it. In national defense, it's better to be safe than sorry. The alert was sounded to scramble interceptors. - Well? - Well, what? Now, let's not play games, Major. Did your men find it? Mr. MacAfee, if you were in uniform, I'd have you under arrest and facing general court martial charges. Unfortunately, you're a civilian. - And I can't touch you. - What are you talking about? But I can send in a report in on you and I will. By the time I get through with you, Mr. Electronics Engineer, you'll be lucky if they let you test batteries for flashlights. Look, Major Bergen, I was flying a final calibration flight. I spotted a UFO, I reported it. Does that make me a criminal, a traitor to my country, or some kind of a psychopath? MacAfee, you're an electronics man, an expert on radar. - Sure, that's what they pay me for. - lf there was something in the air, something flying that you could see, would radar pick it up? - Well, yes, but. - Would radar pick it up? Yes or no? - Yes. - There were three radars on you. Every minute you were in the air and not one of them, not one, saw anything but you. - Look, Major. - You were told this. You knew it. Nevertheless, you persisted with your little joke. - Easy now, Bergen. - You continued to yell wolf until somebody pushed the panic button and scrambled a flight of interceptors. Great. Great. So your buzz boys flew around, they couldn't find anything, so now you're mad and want me to pay for the fuel they burned up or the time they wasted or something else real smart. The flight was scrambled and dispersed to cover as wide an area as possible. And thanks to your not-so-funny false alarm, Mr. MacAfee, one of those planes didn't come back. Plane and pilot, both are missing. Major Bergen. What? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Call out the stand-by crews. You better reshuffle your duty rosters. There'll be plenty of sweat on this one. Look, Major, I'm sorry about the pilot, but that was no false alarm. Oh, come off it, Mitch. You've done enough harm with your flying battleship. - Just let it. - Just a moment, Miss Caldwell. That call. A Transpolar Airlines plane is reported overdue and missing. - Oh, no! - Sixty passengers and a full crew aboard. Got a distress call from the pilot, then nothing. No more contact. - Engine trouble? - No. The pilot yelled something about a UFO. Then the radio went dead. - And our radars? - Nothing. Nothing but the Transpolar plane. Alone in the sky. Well, we're finished up here, Major. - You got transportation ready? - Plane and pilot in the field. - Fly you straight through to New York. - Thanks. Let's go, Sally. Hang on. I'll be back in a minute. Hi, Pete. Getting too rough to work back there. I thought the poop on the weather was we'd have it soft all the way into New York. - Seems to be a local front, Mitch. - How about flying over it? Can do. Wait till I call in. This is Air Force Zebra Love 7979 calling New York lnternational Airport. Over. Zebra Love 7979. This is New York International Airport. Over. Altitude 8,000, air speed 250. Meeting unexpected storm activity, Adirondack region. Request permission to change altitude to 12,000. Over. Zebra Love 7979. Permission granted. Over. Zebra Love 7979. Roger. Out. - Like I said, no sweat. - Thanks, Pete. I'll put in a good word for you with the Major. Oh, thanks loads. Well, I won't know until I run it through the computer, but it looks like the profiler that dips here like this for an extensive blind spot. Yeah. Well, either that antenna is really tilted or we've got a topographical high spot here we didn't figure on that's shading the whole strip. - Could you get that relief map? - Oh, yes. Right here. Mitch. Mitch. Come up here! - What gives? - Sit down, Mitch. - Well? - Something might be coming up. - Such as what? - Unidentified flying object. - Flew right over us. - Not you, too. Oh, save the cracks. I've already called it in to lnternational. Mitch, I sure enough saw something like a cloud. Only it was moving too fast for any cloud. Right at our course from northeast. Two bits it never showed up on a single radar scope. - What? - Never mind. I don't see anything but sky. Neither do l, now. I lost it when it got right overhead. Where'd that come from? We don't register a hatful of wind. Brother, that was more than a hatful. - Are you all right? - I think so. How about you? I'm okay. Pete's in bad shape. Let's go. Down! It's going to blow up. What happened? It felt like something collided with us up there. Yeah. The flying battleship that wasn't there. - Hello! Hello! - Here. Over here. It's good applejack. I make it myself. Fine for the snakebite. Hello, Pierre. Mr. MacAfee? That's right. That the pilot? Yeah. Okay, boys. They made a reservation for you on a commercial flight into New York City. Sending a car to take you and the young lady to the airport. What about the wrecked plane? We've got orders to seal off the area. Real hush-hush. What happened? You tangle with a flying saucer or something? Oh, nothing so domestic as a flying saucer, Officer. Just a flying battleship. Well, have a good time with your flying battleship. Your car will be here soon. - Where's the plane, Pierre? - North 14, past the road. Let's go, boys. Hello? Oui, this is the farm of Pierre Broussard. Who? Oh, one moment. A General Van Buskirk for you, Mr. MacAfee. I feel another snakebite coming on. More medicine. Well, flying battleship, pink elephant. Same difference. You really should try buttermilk instead. I said it looked like a battleship, not that it was a battleship. I should have called it an overgrown adding machine. Then at least you would've believed me. General Buskirk? MacAfee here. Yes, sir. I am aware that the pilot called in a UFO. No, I didn't see anything myself this time. Neither did Miss Caldwell. Oh, the radar picked up nothing but our plane in the area. Well, I was kind of expecting that too. Joke? False alarm? Look here, General, what kind of an infantile jackass do you take me for? I tell you that. Thank you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. When the shepherd cried wolf, they believed him. The first time at least. Civil Aeronautics Board is sending up an investigating team first thing in the morning. So is the Air Force, as soon as the CAB is done. When we get to New York, we're to keep ourselves available for questioning. This glass must have a hole in it. Keeps disappearing. - How's the jug holding up, Pierre? - You like Pierre's applejack, oui? Ah, perfect antidote for snakebite, thunder, lightning, and disbelieving generals. Fill her up, Pierre. - What's that? - Something scared the animal! It's Pierre! Over here. Easy, Pierre, easy. You're safe. You're in the house. - Carcagne! It was the carcagne! I saw her! - What's a carcagne, Pierre? - Come on, tell us about it. - It's the devil in the storm. With the face of the wolf and the body of the woman with wings. - Bigger than I can tell. - You probably saw an eagle, Pierre. - Oh, no! It was la carcagne! La carcagne! - Oh, I remember now. I read it somewhere. It's a superstition, a legend that the French Canadians started and came across the border with. Yeah. It vaguely rings a small bell with me, too. It was probably just the lightning and the storm, Pierre. - You just imagined the whole thing. - No! No! I saw la carcagne! Here. Take another swallow of this. Come in. What's the matter with Pierre? He thinks he saw something weird in the sky. I saw her. I saw la carcagne! - He can't get it out of his head. - Yeah, I know. I live up this way myself. There's a lot of the old folks around here believe that yarn. But this is the first time I ever heard anybody claim he really saw the old witch. - You come to take us to the airport? - Yeah. Car outside. - Oh, I hate to leave him like this. - Oh, don't worry, ma'am. Joe here will stay with him. But we'd better hurry. - They're holding that plane for you. - Come on, Sally. They're holding a plane for us, we'd better get with it. We haven't even thanked him. I'm afraid the social amenities won't mean very much to a man in Pierre's condition. He's right, ma'am. You'd never get through, the way he's scared stiff right now. Scared? So he thought he saw a big bird. Why should that paralyze him so with fright? - Didn't he tell you? - Tell us what? The legend. According to the story they tell, if you see this big bird, it's a sign that you're going to die real soon. - That plane's waiting. We'd better go. - Okay, Sergeant. "The kiss you take is better than you give." A many-faceted creature, this Mr. MacAfee. First engineer and pilot and now lover and poet. Oh, the line of poetry was from Shakespeare. I know, but where did that impulse come from? - Left field, maybe. - I like baseball. Or maybe just sitting next to a pretty girl. That's enough in itself, sometimes. Even sitting next to Mademoiselle Mathematician? Or should we stick to the baseball reference? There are figures and there are figures. Inescapable logic, corny but true. You almost overwhelm me. Almost? Well, let's finish the job. Look at that moon. Speaking of baseball and left field, somebody warned me that you make up your own rules. - Whoever said that's no friend of mine. - But he's a friend of mine. Sabotage! Oh, much too dramatic. Let's stick to baseball and say instead, - "Out, trying to steal second." - Back to the bush leagues, finished. A quitter. I knew it. No fight, no spirit. Of course, the umpire could always reverse her decision. No, no short cuts. Must follow the pattern. First the minor leagues, and then the major leagues. - I stick to the rules, Mitch. Sorry about that. - Why be sorry? You can always. Pattern. - Pattern. - What's the matter? Pattern. I need one of your maps. The orthographic projection, the pole to equator. - Give it to me, will you? - Well, sure. I think I have it here somewhere. Ah. Here it is. What's that? Open your map. Now, where I sighted the UFO. Where the search plane disappeared. The Transpolar airliner. Our plane at Pierre's. And finally the Navy patrol plane. - Well, you were muttering about a pattern. - Well? See it? Well, no. No straight line, no curve, nothing. Wait. A pattern. A perfect pattern in time and distance. Each incident, each cross, later than the one before. Each one further out in the spiral from the center. You mean, something in the air flew a pattern like that? Yeah. Something I saw. Something that flew over and past me in the air. Well, it would have to be traveling at incredible speed to cover - all the distance in the time involved. - Yeah, it would. Something that seemingly destroyed four planes and barely missed you the first time. Yes. Something like your flying battleship? - Okay, forget the whole thing. - Oh, well, now, Mitch. Be reasonable. Why that pattern, just to knock down a few scattered planes? And what? A meteorite? Impossible! A guided missile? Well, that would stop with the first plane it hit. And who would launch it? And for what reason? No, Mitch, coincidence, yes. But pattern, no. Here's your map. Well, you are a child. Mitch, think! If there was anything flying this kind of a pattern, why, it would be tracked by dozens of different radars. And none of them spotted a thing, so what? Well, maybe it was Pierre's carcagne, "with the head of a wolf and the body of a woman, with wings as big as I can tell!" - There's no need to be sarcastic. - Look, would you two mind being quiet so the rest of us can sleep? Thank you. Sorry. Maybe I was being childish. Mitch MacAfee, flying Sherlock Holmes. I think you did make better sense with your poetry than you did with your detective deductions. - I know another poem. - Oh? "Be plain in dress and sober in your diet. "ln short, my deary, kiss me, and be quiet." Date, the 18th of the month. Sky clear, light clouds. Visibility unlimited. Time, 0815 hours. A CAB plane flies toward the scene of the previous day's crash involving Mitchell MacAfee. On board, four members of the Civil Aeronautics Board investigating team. And a pilot. Time, 0816 hours. Another significant moment in history. Once more a frantic pilot radios in a report on a UFO. A bird. A bird as big as a battleship, circling and preparing to attack the CAB plane. Stop leaning on the buzzer. I'm coming. Mr. MacAfee? - Or a reasonable facsimile thereof. - General Buskirk's respects, sir. - He'd like to see you right away. - Oh, have a heart, Captain. I got in late last night. I just about fell asleep when you woke me. - Sorry, sir, the General says it's urgent. - So is my sleep! My orders are to bring you to the General's office at once. Even if I have to take you into protective custody. Okay, Captain, don't get in a tizzy. You keep your shirt on, I'll go get my pants on. My sighting. The search plane, the Transpolar airliner, our plane at Pierre's and the Navy patrol plane. Too much, and it fits too well, to be just coincidence. There have been two more since the Navy plane. A private plane here last night and a CAB plane with four passengers and a pilot here. All following your theoretical pattern smack dab on the nose. No radar tracks, I suppose? As usual, since you started this crazy nightmare, nothing. Except about the planes. Did the pilots report anything? Not a word from the pilot of the private plane. But the CAB pilot reported a UFO. - Did he say what it was? - Yes. A bird. A bird as big as a battleship circled and attacked the plane. - Believe me, Mr. MacAfee, this is no joke. - Oh, no. That plane was completely destroyed. And all five men on board seem to have completely disappeared from the face of the Earth. Now, you're an electronics expert. Could there have been anything that big up in the sky and not be picked up by radar? Impossible! But I saw it myself. Yes. Three men reported they saw something and two of them are now dead. Well, that makes me chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man bird watcher's society. Mr. MacAfee, this is vitally important. Did you get a good look at it? No, it was just a blur as it went past. How I wish I'd had a camera with me. Camera! General Buskirk, before I went out on this radar assignment with Mitch, I was doing Earth curvature calibration work. Well, how does that help us on this? Well, we used film strips photographed from inside test rockets and from fixed cameras and observation balloons. - Sally, maybe you've got it! - lf those balloons are still up, there's a bare possibility they photographed this thing, whatever it is. General Edward Considine, Pentagon. Priority, fast! Something's coming up now. Kill it! This film and all the information pertaining to it and the bird are classified as top secret. Notify all agencies and personnel involved who have handled the project or will handle it. Yes, sir. - Johnson! - Yes, sir? Put the entire command on combat readiness right away. Notify the Pentagon and have them tell General Considine I'm on my way. Yes, sir. Colonel Tyler at the field? Line one, please. Oh, Nate. Nate. Buskirk here. Warm up my plane. And file a flight plan for me to National, Washington. Right. We're coming now. Two extra passengers. Okay. You two are coming with me to Washington. Miss Caldwell. Mr. MacAfee. It's some sort of bird all right. There's no question of that. Miss Caldwell, is it possible that this bird has been flying in blind spot areas - that our radar can't pick up? - No, sir. I checked carefully. At least ten different radar sites should have tracked it. Mr. MacAfee, could speed or altitude affect the ability of our radar to pick it up? No. There's no scientific or any other kind of reason in the world why our radars don't track it. They just don't. Period. Then what you're saying in essence, is that black is white and two and two make six. Look, General, I didn't invent this flying nightmare, I just saw it and reported it. The General understands, Mr. MacAfee. He's not blaming you for anything. Relax, man. Relax? When do we stop relaxing and start doing something? Good sense isn't confined exclusively to civilians, Mr. MacAfee. We know how to take care of ourselves and the country. Easy, Van, easy. Take it easy. There's a general air alert on this very minute, son. Hundreds of planes from every command are combing the skies, searching for this overgrown buzzard. - We'll find it all right. Never fear. - And when we do, General. Then what? Yes? Good! Where? Okay, this is official now. Pass 'em the word to shoot it down. No questions, no games, no stalling. Just shoot it down. Yes. Get me a tape on all air-to-ground and air-to-air channels, and pipe it through a hotline to me here. One of our squadrons just spotted it. I've ordered them to attack and shoot it down. Our planes are armed with cannon, machine guns and rockets. This should be the end of the big bird who was there but wasn't. You'll be able to hear it as it happens. This is Easy Baker squadron leader. - Target below and to the side. See it? - Yow! Holy Toledo! I've seen some mighty big chicken hawks back on the farm, but, man, this baby takes the cake. Honest to pete, I'll never call my mother-in-law an old crow again. This is Easy Baker squadron leader. Peel off on signal. One pass and then you're on your own. This is Easy Baker squadron leader. It's got one of the planes. I must be losing my marbles. This isn't for real. Bullets, rockets, nothing touches it. Easy Baker squadron leader. Charlie hit the silk when the bird got his plane and now it. Charlie's gone. Chute and all. It don't make sense. Like we're hitting a battleship with a slingshot. It's going after another plane. Look out! Easy Baker squadron leader. Mission's a washout. We're going to head for. No! It's coming after me! No! No! Machine guns, cannons, rockets, nothing touched it. - Those pilots. - We'll find it, all right, never fear. The end of the big bird. You were right, Miss Caldwell, when we find it, what then? Phase two off standby, operational. - Notify the Joint Chiefs. - Yes, sir. It doesn't make sense. It's just a bird, a big bird. - Guns. Cannons. Rockets. It's just a bird. - Sure, it's just a bird. Ten million dollars worth of radar can't track it. Enough firepower to wipe out a regiment can't even slow it down. Sure, it's just a bird. Well, what are we going to do, just sit around here and weep? - Oh, climb off our backs, MacAfee. - We're not crying, MacAfee, and we're not running away. But it's hard to come up with answers when you don't even know what the question is. Being flip doesn't help any. I'm not criticizing either of you or the Air Force or those guys who just died trying to shoot that thing down. I'm not being flip, and I'm not wisecracking. I'm just scared. We all are, I guess. So let's face that and then try and do something about that bird. - Any suggestions, MacAfee? - Sure, electronic spitballs! - Van. - Close, General, close. Only not electronic spitballs, atomic spitballs. - Yes? - Phase two operational. - All units alerted and ready. - Good. Call for you. Dr. Karol Noymann at the research lab. I'll take it on two. This is General Considine, Dr. Noymann. Say that again? Good, good. You stay where you are. I'll be right over. Research lab's been kept right up to date. They've been working on the wreckage of that CAB plane - and the plane that you two cracked up in. - Find anything new, Ed? They think they've figured out what that bird is and where it came from. About those atomic spitballs. An hour before your plane landed in Washington, I ordered guided missiles with atomic warheads made ready for every launching site in the country where the fallout pattern makes it safe to explode them. The order you heard me give to make phase two operational was an order to fire those missiles the moment that bird is spotted anywhere! - General, I'm sorry, I guess l. - Don't apologize, son, I admire your spunk. And you keep climbing on our backs whenever we've messed up any of the detail. - Van? - Sorry, Mac. - I guess we're all trying to do our best. - You two better come along. You're up to your ears in this thing anyway. Come on, let's go. The atom is the basic building block of all matter. The atom this model represents is like every atom as we know it. The nucleus is positive. The electrons are all negative. In this respect, it has been maintained that all atoms are alike. But this is wrong, all wrong! According to the law of electrodynamics, all nature is symmetrical. It is in balance. And if there is matter, then there must also be antimatter, a symmetrical mirror image. Now here we have a positive nucleus, negative electrons. In the reverse, we must obviously have a negative nucleus with positive electrons. Science has proved that this is so, not in this Earth nor in this solar system but somewhere in the universe there are stars, planets, whole galaxies made up of antimatter. Well, do you mean to say, Doctor, that this bird is made of antimatter? That it's reversed, inside out, a mirror image, as you call it? Just a minute, General. Doctor, it's been proven that antimatter exists, but it's also been proven that whenever it comes in contact with ordinary matter, they annihilate one another, blow up. Why didn't the bird explode when it was hit, or when it touched something? Well, you are both right and wrong. The bird itself is not antimatter. But the bird unquestionably radiates some sort of force, an energy screen, some invisible barrier. And that energy screen is antimatter. Guns, cannons, rockets, no wonder nothing touched it. Stuff hit the antimatter screen and blew up before it could get close. - Mitch, this explains the failure of the radar. - Yeah. No reflecting surface. The radar waves wouldn't bounce off, they'd slide around. So with no echo, no tracks. Dr. Noymann, a couple of questions. All this isn't just guesswork on your part? No, it is not guesswork, General. Evidently, this bird is able to open that antimatter screen to use its beak, its claws, its wings as destructive weapons. Now, here is part of the wreckage. Examination by a staff of scientists has told us the whole incredible story. It has been checked and double-checked. - ls there anything else, General? - Yes, Doctor. Where did this bird come from? Here is a piece of feather from the bird, found in the wreckage. At least, we call it a feather, we don't know what it is. Only what it looks like. It has defied chemical analysis, the electroscope, every conceivable test. It contains no substance known on the Earth today, no element recognizable by man. - Finding that out was expensive. - Well, how so? We had several of these feathers, this is the only piece left. As a last resort, we tried testing them in electronic analyzers. Look. That bird is extraterrestrial. It comes from outer space, from some godforsaken antimatter galaxy millions and millions of light years from the Earth. No other explanation is possible. Van will fly you two back to New York. I'd appreciate it if you'd hold yourselves in readiness and, of course, you understand that everything that you've seen and heard is classified. My command is ready, Ed, and waiting at the end of a hotline. Just phone. Just phone, Van? Well, I'll need help, all the help I can get. We all will. The only trouble is that the last time I talked to a chaplain, there wasn't any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help that we need. General Considine. This is an emergency. Get me the Secretary of Defense. Up to now, only one man had seen the bird and lived. Among those who knew of it, its existence was a closely guarded secret. But even as arrangements were made for an emergency meeting of the President, the Cabinet, the National Defense Board, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, even then, the bird revealed itself to the world at large and complacency quickly turned to panic. Panic, terror, and horror. No corner of the Earth was spared the terror of looking up into God's blue sky and seeing, not peace and security, but the feathered nightmare on wings. Oh, come in. Well, I worked half the night running your figures through the calculating machine. - Hope the results are what you want. - Good. Thanks. Mitch? Oh. Thank you. Oh, really. For two days and a night now, ever since we got back from Washington, you've had your nose buried in all those papers, figuring, calculating. - Mitch, you've got to stop to sleep and eat. - I've been busy. What you're working on have anything to do with the bird? To destroy the bird? Well, will it work, Mitch? I don't know. I honestly haven't the faintest, foggiest idea. It's one of those cock-eyed concepts that you pull down out of cloud eight somewhere in sheer desperation. Said anything about this to General Buskirk or General Considine? And have them gently remind me to stay in my own backyard? No, thanks. What's the difference? There's only a million-to-one chance it will work. It's just something to do instead of this deadly sitting around and waiting. Mitch, I've been thinking about the bird, too. Yeah, you and everybody else in the world. Ever stop to wonder why the bird came here? Could it have been for food? I mean, does the bird eat, in the sense that we understand eating? Well, Dr. Noymann says that it absorbs energy from the things it destroys, including humans, sort of a molecular osmosis. Could it have come here to rest? - lf it did, it sure as shooting isn't. - Right. So far as we knew the bird just kept flying around the Earth, always flying, never stopping. Well, that's what bothered me, so I called General Buskirk. Mitch, remember Pierre Broussard, at the farm? Yeah, him and his la carcagne, or whatever he thought he saw. It just goes to prove what they always say, truth is stranger than fiction. Well, this was no fiction. Pierre did see something, he saw the bird. 12,000 feet up at night in a storm? - No. The bird came down to Earth. - But you just finished saying. Well, General Buskirk told me they found the mark of a giant claw on a field next to Pierre Broussard's farm, and I know why. The bird came here to build a nest. Nest. Eggs. More birds. It's got to be true. There's just no other reason for it. General Buskirk. MacAfee calling. This is urgent. Baby, gather up those papers for me, will you please? Take these, too. General Buskirk? MacAfee. Now, please don't argue or ask for reasons. I'll explain later. It's desperately important. I need a fast plane, and then a helicopter. Please, please, General, believe me. I know what I'm doing. Yeah, at Broussard's place, the farm. Right. We're leaving right now. Sally's with me. Yes. We'll go straight to the airport. We interrupt this program for an important announcement. Ladies and gentlemen, speaking from Washington, Lieutenant General Considine, United States Air Force. We are faced with a crisis, a crisis for which all the nations of the world, in unprecedented cooperative action, have found as yet no solution. Until we do, we shall not rest. We have tried every weapon in the arsenals of the mightiest armies on Earth. They have proven worse than useless. Atomic, hydrogen weapons, capable of wiping cities, countries off the face of the Earth, are completely ineffective against this creature from the skies. Two days ago, all aircraft were grounded. Deprived of its source of food or energy, however the bird survives, the bird began a series of attacks on the ground, in a fantastic orgy of destruction never before seen. Nothing has been safe from attack by the bird, cattle, horses, fields, homes, trains, all manner of transportation. It has become obvious that the bird is attracted by movement. Accordingly, your government and all the governments of the world have declared a state of emergency and instituted martial law. In addition to grounding all aircraft, all surface transportation, cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships at sea, all such traffic must be halted at once. The movement of food and essential supplies will be handled by the armed forces. Blackout conditions will be observed from sunset to dawn every night until further notice. Movement of any sort on the streets or highways during the daylight hours must be held to an absolute minimum and only where it has been authorized as essential. You have just heard General Considine speaking from Washington. Stay tuned. Mitch! Well, that plane is waiting for us. We've gotta get up to Pierre's place. There it is! We'd better land before that decides to do it again. The guns. Two Weatherby.378 Magnums, they'll stop anything. Anything, Mitch? Well, anything but the bird, but we're looking for eggs. Without antimatter energy screens, you hope. - La carcagne? - No, Pepe, not la carcagne, a million times worse. Let's get out of here. It looks like the nest, all right. No sign of any egg. Well, it might be somewhere down in there. Only way to find out is to go down there and look. La carcagne! An egg! You shoot gun, make the big noise. La carcagne come and we all die. We have to get that egg, Pierre, it's our only chance. Pierre, he not stay. Pierre! Come back! I'm from Montana. Pierre and his la carcagne. - He was right. Seeing it did mean his death. - Yeah. I'll alert Washington. They'll get out search parties. Everywhere in the world, wherever the bird has been sighted, just on the off chance that there might be more eggs, so they can be found and destroyed. That much we can do. Well, let's get back to the city. With that bird around, it's too dangerous to fly. We'll leave the chopper and take Pierre's car. He won't be needing it. - Come on, Brad, make this thing go. - Yeah, come on. Let's get some speed on this. Oh, man, he ain't moving at all. Come on! Come on! - Some maniac driving with lights and fast. - Maybe he didn't hear the proclamation. I'll flag him down when he tries to pass. - Hey, daddy-o, get that tin can off the road. - Come on, man. - Hey, man, who's afraid of the big bad bird? - Turn out your lights! Get off the road! Don't worry about us, we've got salt for its tail. Hey, watch out for that salt, don't get it in the carbs! Come on, let's go! Crazy kids! They don't know what they're doing! - Dig you later, 'gator. - Hey, daddy-o, don't call us, we'll call you. - They boy is badly hurt, but he's alive. - The girl's unconscious. There's a town up ahead with a hospital. We'll take them there. You and I are going in to Washington tonight. I'll bring the car over here for the kids. Miss Caldwell, MacAfee, I'm a busy man. I hope this isn't some sort of crackpot wild goose chase. You and me both, General. Well, it's your dime, boy. What is it you want to show me? - How to shoot the bird out of the sky. - Some new type of weapon? No, with regular guns, bullets and bombs. Anything you want. MacAfee, I told you that I haven't got time. Listen, General. This idea of mine may prove to be as phony as a $3 bill, - but I still think it's worth a listen. - Well, go ahead. Now I don't care whether that bird came from outer space or Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, it's still made of flesh and blood of some sort and vulnerable to bullets and bombs. If you can get past that antimatter energy screen. Right. That's exactly what I think, what I hope I've figured out how to do. I've just invested a dime of my own, boy. Keep talking. Now, this is a blow-up I had made of a bubble chamber photograph. The chamber was bombarded with high-speed particles. Result, a photograph of a trail made by what is known as a mu meson. But notice this hole, this gap right here. This gap is one of the most exciting and significant recent discoveries in all science. You probably know about it, Dr. Noymann. Yes, yes. The formation of a temporary mesic atom, the mu meson with a hydrogen nucleus. Right. But mu mesons are 210 times heavier than electrons. Which means that in a mesic atom, the electrons revolve around a nucleus at just a small fraction of the ordinary distance in a normal atom. I know you don't understand all this, General, but stick with me. Now, the mesic atom is extremely small, small enough to sift through the electron defenses of the ordinary atom - and fuse with its nuclei. - Atoms of matter or antimatter. Right, Doc! Now if this thing of mine works and we can get close, real close, and bombard that bird's antimatter energy shield with a stream of mesic atoms, I think we can destroy that shield. The bird would be defenseless then except for beak, claws and wings. You could hit it with everything but the kitchen sink. We've got kitchen sinks to spare, son. Do you think you can do it? Well, I've kicked around some ideas. I'm not sure they'll work, - but it's certainly worth a try. - Well, what do you need? This lab, Dr. Noymann and his staff, Sally here to help with the math, and a blank check for supplies and equipment. It was yours before you finished asking for it. MacAfee, time is running out. Today, tomorrow, a week from now maybe. Besides I'd hate to lose that dime I've got invested in you. Good luck, son. - Well, anybody ready for some work? - Work or maybe some magic. - What we need is a miracle! - Here it is. A miracle. A dime's worth of miracle. This weapon would have to create mesic atoms, not as rare and isolated laboratory phenomena, but in tremendous quantities, eject them through some aiming and propelling device so they could travel indefinite distances through the air to arrive with sufficient speed and in sufficient numbers to bombard and destroy an antimatter shield. Truly a miracle of science. Especially since the scientific total life expectancy for a mesic atom, up to now, measured in laboratories, had been one two-millionth of a second. Failure. Failure after failure after failure. And while a handful of dedicated people struggled to achieve the impossible, panic spread to all corners of the Earth. Panic and nightmare terror. Easy. Mitch. Easy, son, easy. You did your best. We can't have you killing the patient trying to cure the disease, now, can we? A magnificent effort, Mitch, magnificent. It's unfortunate it was doomed to failure from the start. Oh, great. Now if somebody will just deliver the eulogy, the deceased can be safely laid away to rest. What's the matter with you, are you all nuts or something? Mitch, are you all right? Sally, how long has it been since the explosion? About an hour and a half, two hours, I guess. - Oh, we're wasting time. - Easy, son, easy. - ls that bird still in the air? - Why, yes. - You still want to shoot it down? - Why, yes, yes, sure. Well, then, for pete's sake, let's get with it. General Buskirk has had a plane waiting in that field outside of New York ever since we started the experiments. We've got to get the equipment installed on that plane. Mitch, the apparatus didn't work. The experiments failed. Mitch, please lie down in bed. You were hurt in that explosion. Of course, you don't know. The explosion was no accident. I did it on purpose. I used the mesic atom projector. What? Well, sure. We had the basic wiring all fouled up. It was a simple matter of adjusting the polarity on the main condenser terminals. I figured it out while you two were asleep, set it up right and tried it. - Now wait a minute, MacAfee. - Mitch! Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that that machine of yours works? - Sure. - What kind of plane has - Buskirk got waiting for you? - An old, stripped-down B-25. Good. Maneuverability instead of speed. Yeah, the whole operation may depend on being able to turn on a dime. Well, then what in blazes are we waiting for? Well, that's what I've been talking about for 10 minutes. Get me my pants, will you, General? Oh, Sally, get out of here. We've installed the ejector nozzle in the tail of the plane, - pointing to the back. - Rewiring the plane's generating system, plus an added bank of batteries, should give us more than enough power. Now, weight's a problem. How many people will you need to operate this machine? The doctor, myself and a calculator. Have you got someone coming up here for Sally to brief in a hurry? - I don't want her on that plane. - He's coming in from the city now. One question. Why do you aim that gimmick from the tail and not from the nose? Too dangerous in the nose. We might fly into our own mesic bombardment - and destroy the plane. - Chances are, once we locate the bird and we're up in the air, the bird will chase us. - And if it doesn't? - We'll attract its attention somehow. - Sandwiches and coffee. - Thank you. The bird's been sighted heading for New York City. - How long will it take you to finish? - An hour and a half or two. - Still got to connect the thing up. - No, that's too long. We've got to take off in 15 minutes. You'll have to finish in the air. What about the calculator to replace Sally? Sorry, MacAfee, we haven't got any time for that. - General. - Van, you'll fly, I'll back-stop you. - Clear the field for a takeoff. - Right. Well, what are we waiting for? Get the rest of your stuff on board. There it is now, attacking the United Nations building. Make a pass at it. The bird's after us, chasing us. How are you doing? - Ready in a minute. - Well, fast, boy, fast. For God's sake, hurry, man! It's catching up with us fast. Got it! Close those circuits. It's all yours, General. Steady. Steady. Fire rockets. We got it. "THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU - 2011" Sub.Re-Edit.by. :: npdv.indoheroes[at]gmail.com :: <i>Let's welcome our favorite alumnus,</i> <i>and the next senator from the state of New York,</i> <i>David Norris!</i> <i>Thank you. Thank you.</i> <i>Well, hi, there.</i> <i>My name is David Norris,</i> <i>and I'd like to be the next senator from the great state of New York.</i> Look at you. What's your name? I'm going to go through Yonkers, door to door and take the city that way. We love you. <i>The recent endorsement by the fire fighter's union</i> <i>is another boost to Norris</i> <i>who already had a six-point lead</i> <i>over his opponent, Roger Linfield.</i> Whenever I see you on C- Span, and you stand, I always think you're about to go, "Chug!" Congressman, you certainly started your career off, <i>eight years ago, with a bang or should I say, a bust.</i> <i>For the last eight years,</i> <i>David Norris has represented Brooklyn, New York City and America.</i> This is my campaign chairman, Charlie Traynor. These are voters. Latest polls have you up 10 points. <i>We're 10 points up?</i> <i>This is not going to be easy getting there.</i> <i>I have some real opposition,</i> <i>and what they're saying about me</i> <i>is that I'm too young to hold this office.</i> Win big, but run like you're 20 down. Okay, you got it. Thank you, Gary. <i>But that's okay because these are the same people</i> <i>who say that young people don't vote,</i> <i>young people don't care about politics,</i> <i>but I'm here to tell you,</i> <i>your future is about your choices, not theirs.</i> <i>So, today I'd like to put them on notice</i> <i>because come November, I want them to know</i> <i>that it was young people like you,</i> <i>who kicked their asses.</i> David! David! <i>Thank you.</i> Charlie. What's wrong? Yeah? <i>Any ideas?</i> I'm working on it. <i>Keep me posted.</i> Yeah. <i>David Norris,</i> <i>until recently, he was way ahead in the polls.</i> <i>Mary Matalin and James Carville are here.</i> <i>Mary, this is a surprise.</i> <i>It is a surprise. Such political promise.</i> <i>This compelling story, he grew up in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.</i> <i>He overcame the loss of his entire family,</i> <i>his mom and his brother when he was 10,</i> <i>his father before he got to high school, he got over that.</i> <i>He had such promise.</i> <i>And he was the youngest person</i> <i>ever elected to the House of Representatives.</i> <i>Yeah, he was elected when he was actually 24,</i> <i>but he gets in a bar room fight the night that he's elected.</i> <i>I like this, all right.</i> <i>Then you have this photo coming out of the New York Post.</i> <i>I think the accretion of this stuff</i> <i>was just too much for the voters.</i> <i>It reeked of some level of immaturity here,</i> <i>of impulsiveness.</i> <i>People want maturity, they want adults in Congress.</i> Big night for us, gentlemen. Everybody ready? You look exhausted. You should take a vacation when all this is finished. You've earned it. I'm not sure the kind of tired I am can be fixed by a vacation. Everybody needs a vacation, even us. All right, let's get him back on track. <i>Mary, over the past couple of weeks</i> <i>since the photo came out, they thought people.</i> Why are you still watching CNN? <i>That it wasn't such a big deal, but clearly it was.</i> They called this way too early. Come on. Put on your pretty little tie and let's go. Suffolk County numbers, Linfield, 415,120. Norris. 370,233. Wow. I really thought we'd win Suffolk. Kings County just came in, too. Well. I didn't win Brooklyn. It's going to be a blow out. NBC has us up next. I'm going to go work on my speech. David. David. Hey! I'm sorry I wasted your time, Charlie. <i>NBC news is now calling the election for Roger Linfield.</i> <i>After a shockingly poor showing at both Suffolk County,</i> <i>and his home county, Kings,</i> <i>it now appears David Norris will lose this election badly.</i> Hello? Hello? I grew up in Red Hook, and I don't want to surprise anybody, but I got into a few fistfights along the way. It's not whether or not you get knocked down, it's what you do when you get back up. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here tonight to tell you I will get back up. But tonight is not about me. It is about coming together and welcoming the newest senator for the great state of New York, Roger Linfield. Shit! Shit, shit, shit. Hello? It's the men's. Yep. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I just didn't know what to do. I heard you come in and say, "Hello," and I probably should have said, "Hi," but then I thought that would be weird because it's the men's. Then you started talking to yourself and it was obviously very personal. So I was stuck in no man's land, and then it all got to be too much, so I came out. What are you doing in here? Just. I'm hiding from security. Why? I crashed a wedding upstairs. People still do that? It was a dare. Who dared you to crash a wedding? Me. Oh. I crashed a wedding once. Did you? Yeah, in high school. Oh. But I got caught. I spent the night in jail. I think that happened more than once from what I heard. You're that guy running for Senate, aren't you? Yeah, I am that guy. And judging from your speech, you're not winning? No. Oh. That's too bad, the other guy is such a tool. He is a tool. I wish I could have made that clearer in the campaign ads. Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal. <i>The Post did not have to run the photo.</i> At least not a full page. God, no. It was my favorite moment of your whole campaign. Really? I could have used you on my team a couple of months ago. I could help poll test every word that comes out of your mouth before you say it. Oh, you like politicians? I like it when they do stuff I can relate to. Like pull their pants down? I love that. See, that kind of candidate wouldn't even get elected to the student council. My guy would know how to tie his own tie. It's a clip-on. Oh, I wish. That would have been my other favorite moment of your campaign. Do you still have a chance? Is it over? He crushed me. Sorry. Well, losing has its advantages. Like what? For one thing, as a politician, you're never really alone unless you're asleep, or in the bathroom usually. That gets old. Really? Yeah, I guess I'm mostly just looking forward to having some time by myself. I don't buy it. I think you love it. Do I know you? I guess I could have been more convincing. Okay. You don't have to worry about being convincing till the next election. Are you a registered New York voter? Do I sound like I am? Holy shit. David. Oh. Wow, sorry, guys. Sorry. I got to go. Sorry. Wow. Hang on. You going to give your speech? Hang on. Hey! Hey. Ma'am. I got to go. Ma'am? That is so much better. She's on the move. Southwest staircase. Excuse me? Ma'am. What was that? I don't know. Are you ready? Yeah, yeah. All right, go do the speech. Come on. <i>Congressman David Norris.</i> <i>I grew up not far away from here, in Red Hook.</i> Brooklyn! I love you, David! I love you more! <i>I love you both.</i> <i>But we had a rule in my neighborhood.</i> <i>When you got in a fight,</i> <i>it wasn't whether or not you got knocked down,</i> <i>it's what you do when you get back up.</i> <i>And I came here to tell you tonight,</i> <i>that I will get back up.</i> <i>It's bullshit.</i> <i>We didn't have that saying in my neighborhood.</i> <i>It's just one of those phrases</i> <i>that had some traction with the focus group</i> <i>and so we kept using it, but it's not true.</i> <i>In 1998, I did a cover story for GQ.</i> <i>The title was "Youngest Congressman Ever. "</i> <i>And since then, every story has tried</i> <i>to explain how I got here so fast.</i> <i>And the word that people kept using was "authentic. "</i> <i>But here's the problem.</i> <i>This isn't even my tie.</i> <i>Go get Jim for me. This tie was selected for me</i> <i>by a group of specialists in Tenafly, New Jersey</i> <i>who chose it over 56 other ties we tested.</i> <i>In fact, our data suggests that I have to stick to</i> <i>either a tie that is red or a tie that is blue.</i> <i>A yellow tie made it look as if I was taking my situation lightly,</i> <i>and I may in fact, pull my pants down again at any moment.</i> <i>A silver tie meant that I'd forgotten my roots.</i> <i>My shoes.</i> <i>You know, shiny shoes,</i> <i>we associate with high-priced lawyers and bankers.</i> <i>If you want to get a working man's vote,</i> <i>you need to scuff up your shoes a little bit.</i> <i>But you can't scuff them up so much</i> <i>that you alienate the lawyers and the bankers</i> <i>because you need them to pay for the specialists back in Tenafly.</i> <i>So, what is the proper scuffing amount?</i> <i>Do you know we actually paid a consultant $7,300.</i> <i>Was it $7,300, Charlie?</i> Nice. What an asshole. <i>$7,300, for a consultant to tell us that this is the perfect amount of scuffing.</i> He has to spill his coffee on his shirt by 7:05. 7:05 at the latest. I'll get him as soon as he enters the park. Can't imagine being on this guy as long as you have. <i>.for energy efficient technologies.</i> <i>RSR Venture Capital announced yesterday</i> <i>that former Congressman David Norris, would become a senior partner.</i> <i>Norris led an unsuccessful bid for Senate last month.</i> <i>But his concession speech was considered, by many, to be electrifying</i> <i>and has made him the obvious front runner in the 2010 Senate race.</i> <i>Investment banker Charles Traynor founded RSR,</i> <i>one of the country's most successful venture capital firms.</i> <i>Traynor is a childhood friend of Norris'</i> <i>and was the Chairman of his Senate campaign. Hey!</i> <i>Hey. Tom Frankel from The Journal is calling you in five minutes.</i> I just gave him this number. Give him 3-2-2-7. I'm not used to this phone yet. <i>No, I can't. He's going to ask you about joining the firm.</i> <i>All business calls have to be done on a company Blackberry.</i> <i>Really? Sarbanes-Oxley,</i> you voted for it, pal. In fact, you co-sponsored that one. <i>Yeah, I remember.</i> Hey, I just saw you on TV. <i>Really? Yeah.</i> What did they say? You're bald. Nice. <i>Yeah, it was weird, too, because it was a financial show.</i> But they were really captivated by your receding hairline. <i>I got to go, you jack-off.</i> Bye. Congressman. I have to tell you, I really admire what you did last month. Thank you. I appreciate it. I wish there were more politicians like you. Thank you. I'm retired now. I had to go get a real job. You'll do well. Thank you. Hey! You got a guy running for the bus. There is another M6 right behind me. Hey! No way. Sorry. Oh, my God. Have we met? You look vaguely familiar. Waldorf men's room. You got it. Were you just staring at my legs while I slept? I was defenseless against the small dress. It's a skirt. It's a belt. What is it with you and the argyle? What is the deal with you and the boring shades of blue? My clothes match. Did your team pick that out for you? No team. Team is gone. Wow. I did it all by myself. I saw your speech. Yeah, the speech. Something must have got into me. Wow, that is something. Really augments the moment. Nice ring, asshole. Hello? Hello? It doesn't even work. Could that ringer get louder or do you have that maxed out? It's a new phone. Are you going to run again? Don't know. I'm starting a new job today. You have to run again. You can't do that. The country will end up being run by tools like Linfield. It kind of is. Oh, shit. Sorry. I don't know what just happened. Are you okay? I'm fine. Can you hand me that? You sure you okay? Yeah. I'll pay for the dry cleaning. No, it's really fine. Please don't. Wow. Seven bucks will probably cover it. You keep that, you might need it. You know what? Here. You write your number down then I can call you and come pick up your skirt. Oh, my goodness, me. That is very smooth. Oh, shit. Why don't you let me spill some on you and then we'll be even? That's a terrible idea. I think it's a great idea. Just one bit because that's not fair. You actually are crazy. No, now it all makes sense. Okay, hang on. Oh, jeez. He's not here. I know, I'm sorry. Who was that? I don't know. Who cares? It'll be on the. Can you just. No. Okay, now we're in the third grade. This is great. It's a sturdy little fucker, isn't it? I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, it just happened. Okay. Okay, that was a new phone. Let's wipe it off. I'm Elise, by the way. I'll remember that. That's my number. Terrific, thank you. I'll call you. The morning after the election, I woke up thinking about you. Hey, man, what's up? <i>You're not going to believe who I just ran into.</i> Who? The girl from election night. <i>The one you kissed? She kissed me.</i> <i>You still sticking with that story?</i> <i>It's the truth. Whatever, dude.</i> They're ready for you in the main conference room. <i>What are the odds? It's amazing.</i> That's great, man, just don't take her advice on speeches anymore. First time worked, it's not going to work again. You're just jealous because it's the best speech I ever gave and you didn't write it. Just so you know, I think I'm coming down against your solar panel thing. <i>Why?</i> I just don't think the research is there and the price point is too high on these things. <i>Of course, it's too high.</i> <i>But if our company doesn't get involved with stuff like this, who will?</i> Convince me in the meeting. I will. See you, buddy. Hey, Janet. Hey, Susan. We just got approval for a recalibration on the Lasalle case. Two minutes. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Grab him. 9-1-1, Janet! 9-1-1! Oh. You can't get away, David. David, I really wish you'd just listen to me. All right, I'll handle it. David, you really are making this harder than it has to be. All right, take it easy, guys. Take it easy. Take it easy. It's okay, David. No. No, sir. It's being taken care of. Yes, sir. It's being taken care of. Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I understand. I'll take care of it. What a goddamn mess. Donaldson? Yes. McCRADY: What do you want to do? We have to reset him. Call for a briefcase. McCRADY: You kidding? It's going to take a signed order from the Chairman. Get legal on it. Legal just arrived. There's no way the Chairman approves a reset. This is your fault. There is no way you get a briefcase. Hey. What are my options? Hey. Just bullshit him. Bullshit this guy? Hey! What's going on here? Look at this. Questions will burn in him till the day he dies. He won't stop searching for answers. He won't quit. We have to watch him forever, make sure he doesn't talk. Endless ripple effects. You remember the Torres case 40 years ago? It's not that bad, is it? In the end, they just leveled with him. Completely? Looking at that, I don't see you have a choice. Who the hell are you guys? We are the people who make sure things happen according to plan. My name is Richardson. Oh. You really think I couldn't see that coming? I can read your mind. Yeah, really. Pick a color. Blue. Pick a number. Seventeen. Now, why are you still thinking about running? I don't really know what's going on here. You've just seen behind a curtain that you weren't supposed to know existed. Must be jarring. It's not your fault. Your path through the world this morning was supposed to have been adjusted. You were supposed to spill your coffee as you entered the park this morning. You would have gone upstairs to change, you would have missed the bus, and you would have arrived at work 10 minutes later than you did, and we would have been gone. I was supposed to spill my coffee? We call that an adjustment. See, sometimes, when people spill their coffee or their Internet goes out or they misplaced their keys, they think it's chance. And sometimes it is. Sometimes it's us nudging people back on plan. Sometimes when nudging isn't enough, management authorizes a recalibration. We deploy our Intervention Team and they change your mind for you, like we did with your friend Charlie. He's fine, by the way. You don't need to worry about him. Now. There is something I need you to understand if I'm going to let you go. Okay. Very few humans have seen what you've seen today, and we're determined to keep it that way. So, if you ever reveal our existence, we'll erase your brain. The Intervention Team will reset you. Your emotions, your memories, your entire personality will be expunged. Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy. You won't think anything. You understand? Not one word about us. Okay. Oh, one more thing, you bumped into a woman this morning on the bus. Elise? What does that have to do with anything? You were never supposed to see her again. What does that matter? Because it matters. McCRADY: It's in his wallet. Hey, hey. God! Hey! What's with you guys? Jesus! Oh, come on. No! No! What the hell? Really? What the hell? Okay. Okay. Take him back. Enjoy the rest of your day. I can walk. I'm capable of walking. Dude, what are you doing on my floor? You know, I called you like 10 times, you could have picked up. Christine, I found him. He's in my office. What the hell are you doing? Round up the guys, we're going to do the meeting now. You have a headache? What is wrong with you? Hey, we're in the big conference room on 17. Let's go. Morning, Congressman. You sure you're okay? Yeah, you? I'm great, why? You don't have a headache or anything? No, I feel fantastic, man. Is it me or this an odd conversation? On David's solar panel deal, our tech guy has serious doubts about the efficiency ratings they're claiming. They'd need a 20-fold improvement over anything anyone else has been able to manufacture at that price point to really be a game-changer. You're opposed to this anyway, Charlie. And with these financials. Whoa, whoa. I know it's a risk, but if our company doesn't take a chance on something like this, then who will? I mean, I'm willing to take a fire on something that could change the world. Not to mention, be incredibly lucrative. David? Yeah, I mean, it's why I took the job here. All right. Let's do it. Come into my office for a second. Something is wrong. A couple of hours ago you miraculously reunite with the girl of your dreams. Explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear grin right now. I lost her number. What? The woman on the bus. I lost her phone number and all I had was her first name, so, I'm never going to see her again. I'm sorry. Wow, I'm really sorry. Your entire world is turned upside down and you're thinking about a woman. Even if you could remember the number, you'll never get through. Lost cell phone, changed numbers, whatever creates the fewest ripples. My name is Harry, by the way. The fewest ripples? You freeze people. You froze my friend. We need special authorization to. Poke around in people's brains. You make them think whatever you want. Be quiet, David. Can I get you something? Just some water, please. Your friend will be fine. Recalibrations make tiny changes in the way people reason. It doesn't work on emotion or personality. That's too intrusive. You said authorization. Authorization from who? The Chairman. The Chairman? That's just a name we use. You use many other names. We can't talk here. Meet me on the 4:00 p. m. boat and I'll answer what I can. If you reveal us, even if it's unintentional. I know. You'll bump me on the head. Richardson has automatic authority to reset you. You mean lobotomize me? Try not to forget it. Be on the 4:00 p. m. boat. Ask your questions, I'll tell you what I can. What were they doing to Charlie? Just changing the way he weighs investment risks which will subtly shift the direction of his company in the way upstairs wants. So, Richardson could read my mind? Richardson was trying to scare you. No, he knew the number I was thinking of, the color. Because he set it up as a choice. "Choose a color, choose a number. ' ' We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. When you make a decision, your mind weighs options. We can perceive them. We know when you're going to go off the plan or not because if we're close enough, we can sense when it's going to happen. We're just here to keep you on plan. That's all we're authorized to do. Are you allowed to be telling me this stuff? Are they following me now? We have to monitor the entire world. We don't have the manpower to follow everyone all the time. And there is something about water. It blocks our ability to read your decision tree. Are you an angel? We've been called that. We're more like case officers who live a lot longer than humans. Why are you helping me? I have my reasons. And why won't they let me be with Elise? All I know is the amount of resources they've used keeping you from her is pretty damn important to them. You're going to look for her, aren't you? You won't find her. They'll make sure of it. <i>Even if they weren't trying to stop you,</i> <i>there are nine million people in this city.</i> <i>You'll never find her.</i> <i>Forget about her.</i> <i>Move on with your life.</i> Stop! Stop the bus! Elise? Elise, hi. David. You know, I rode the M6 to work every day for three years hoping that I'd bump into you. Listen, is there a place we could go and talk? Don't you have to get to work or something? I just got sick. "I haven't seen you in three years, you make me sick. ' ' That's not an ideal come-on, just so you know. What are you looking for? I felt like someone was watching us. Hey, Charlie, I'm going to have to skip breakfast, and I probably have to postpone the speech, too. I just bumped into Elise. You just hung up on your friend. We've known each other since we were kids. What speech? It doesn't matter. You want to take a walk? No. We have a lot to catch up on. I don't think you should cancel your speech. What if I don't like you at the end of our walk? I'll take my chances. Seriously, my number hasn't changed, just call me like you didn't last time. Look, if you take a walk with me, I'll explain why. It's been years. How do you know I don't have a nice boyfriend? Do you have a nice boyfriend? Would it matter if I did? Yeah. So you don't have any real conviction then? Okay, it wouldn't matter at all. So, you don't mind being a home-wrecker? Congressman! How are you doing, man? I'm from Red Hook. You're the best. Thank you. Good to see you. If you were married, then it would bother me. But now you're just saying what you think I want to hear. I'm single. Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for not calling me. I didn't have your number. I gave it you on the bus. Handed it to you. I was mugged. It was taken from me. No, come on. My wallet was taken. Come on. Why else would I fawn all over you on a bus three years ago and then never call you? Because, I don't know! You have a girlfriend and you felt terrible. Listen, I swear to you that I did not have your number. All right. No, on my parents' graves. That's heavy. That's too heavy, I know, but it's true. I didn't have your number. And I didn't even have a last name to go by. If you google just "Elise," you get 757,000 hits. You did not. And none of them are you. We have a problem. What? David Norris is off plan. Son of a bitch. How did he find her? Chance. Just spotted her on the street. We never should have let him meet her in the first place. We followed protocol to the letter. Guy rides the same bus every day for three years. Who does that? Three years later, I'm still cleaning up your mess. Let's cut the power at her dance studio. I'm a dancer. Oh. Not like that, you pervert. I'm in a contemporary ballet company. I think you have the wrong idea about me. No, I think that was the first thing that crossed your mind, actually. I think you should invite me to one of your performances. The company is called Cedar Lake, and there is actually a show tomorrow night, if you want. Is that an invitation? No, it's information. We're covering the girl's artistic director and we're still working on Charlie Traynor. This whole thing will be over in an hour. Hi, how are you? Paul, right? How did you remember that? I'm a politician, I'm good with names. Her decision tree is diverging from our models. It's just the two of you? Yes. Thirty-six hours without contact, she'll never speak to him again. Look at her file. It's the last thing in the world she'll put up with. No, something's wrong. I'm already seeing inflection points. You okay? Yeah. We're in motion on changing the location of her rehearsal. You have to be born with the right body like very flexible hips and shoulders and long neck. And you weren't? No, I was. I was lucky. But after 15 years of that precision and the training. How is everything over here? It's great. Thank you. It's good, thank you. So, I wanted to try something else just on my own, open-ended and human, I guess. What do you mean? Look. What's this? If they kiss. A kiss? That's all it takes? A real kiss. If that happens, every possible adjustment strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit. I think that everything you go through in life should come out in the way that you dance. I haven't found that to be the case with my dancing. It's a shame. David, hate to interrupt. Hi. Hi, nice to see you again, Elise. How did you find me? Does it matter? Nice work. There's a crowd of people waiting for your announcement speech at the Brooklyn Bridge right now. You're announcing today? You can't skip this for me. I know. I told you I'm not going to let you out of my sight. David, what the hell? Do you want to come? Do you want to watch? No. I can't, I have to go and rehearse. Actually, I just heard that they're moving my rehearsal to Pier 17, right next to the bridge. Why don't we just postpone it? We'll do the speech another time. No, David, come on, you can't do that. Thank you. You have to go. Check. David, she's rehearsing so close. It'll take you three minutes to get there after the speech. All right. Just come over when you're done. Keep the change. Thank you. Have Charlie's aide call him now. Are you sure you don't want a ride? No, I have to go home and change. You're so late. Your friend is about to cry. I'm wrangling him right now. Yeah, I know. Shifting her rehearsal to Pier 17 was a genius move. We're not out of the woods yet. Come over when you're done. David. Okay. Sorry, the TV crew is there. We got to go, man. We're okay. Look, whatever happens, I'm not going to let anything come between us again. Okay. I'll see you soon. Hey, how you doing? Thank you. Appreciate it. How are you? Thanks a lot. Good to see you, too. <i>Thank you.</i> <i>I have to say, it's good to be back in Brooklyn.</i> <i>There's been a lot of speculation</i> <i>as to whether or not. McCRADY: It's done.</i> <i>.I would run for a Senate seat here in the state of New York.</i> <i>I came here today to put an end to that speculation</i> <i>and to tell you, unequivocally,</i> <i>I will seek the Senate seat for the great state of New York.</i> David! David! Shit. Don't forget, I added the bankers' group <i>after The Daily Show tomorrow.</i> Are you listening to me? David? I cannot get a break on this case. Okay. I got to get to Pier 17. Do the interview and you can do whatever you want. Just handle the interviews for me. I'll talk to those guys. This has got to go on the nightly news. I got to see Elise right now. Every time we get close, you do something to mess this up. This is different. <i>City, please?</i> Manhattan. <i>What listing?</i> Cedar Lake. It's a dance company. <i>Connecting.</i> He's going to ask the parking attendant to use the hard line. I already killed it. Excuse me, can I use your phone? I have an emergency. McCRADY: Restaurant across the street. Mmm-hmm. I took out everything for three blocks. This guy is a pain in the ass. Come on, let's go talk to him. There is a whole world of women out there. I thought we established this one was off limits. It's been a while, I must have forgotten. Doesn't change the fact. You put us together three times. That wasn't us, that was just chance. Why do you want to keep us apart? Because the plan says so. Then you misread the plan. There is no misreading the plan when it comes to you and Elise. Then the plan is wrong. Do you know who wrote it? I don't care. You should. You should really show a little respect. If I'm not supposed to be with her, how come I feel like this? It doesn't matter how you feel. What matters is what is in black and white. You don't know why I'm not supposed to be with her, do you? That's why you can't tell me. You don't know. Who is this guy? Uh-oh. Excuse me, everyone. Sorry to disturb your lunch. It's an emergency. Has anyone here ever seen a performance at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company? The Cedar Lake Ballet Company? Yeah, I have. Where is it? Son of a bitch. Hey, taxi. Hey! Taxi! Hey! Taxi! Maybe you should try the subway. Don't all these taxies you're diverting have plans, too? How long you going to keep that up? Twenty minutes? An hour? Wow, the ripples must just be endless. I don't care what you put in my way, I'm not giving up. Hey! Hey! Hey! Taxi! Hey! You all right? You okay? What happened? You got hit. Are you okay? I think so. Don't move. You all right? Hello, I just witnessed an accident on the corner of Water and Dover Street. Unfortunately, you're the only witness, Congressman. But we did this three times already. I just need a few more details. Oh, I see. You're not even a cop, are you? You're one of them. Calm down. Okay. Someone could have been killed. Sir, if you would just calm down. Hey, Sergeant. Hi. Sorry, excuse me, I know you need a statement from me, but do I need to stay here or can I do it over the phone? No, sir, we know how to get in touch with you. Okay. Now, is this man under your command? Never mind. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey! You want to make a quick 100 bucks? You're going to have to break a couple of traffic laws. All right, 26th and 10th. It's a ballet company called Cedar Lake. Go through that. Look out! Watch it. This is going to keep happening, just go through. Son of a bitch! Set a traffic jam on Broadway. Too many ripples. He's getting out of range. I don't know what to do with this. You're reaching your limit. Hey! Excuse me. Two down. Two down. Oh, shit! Next one. I hate downtown. Sorry. I've got inflection points. All he needs to do is see her dance and you're at your ripple limit. What? All right, block the door. He's already through it. Not that one, the next one. Excuse me. David Norris, I'm here to see Elise. I'm blocking them all. Hat! Hat! Is she here? Yeah, she's in the studio. McCRADY: It's too late. He's already seen her. You hit your ripple limit. Celebrate now. They're just going to kick it upstairs. It's Donaldson. He has no idea what he's up against. Let's take a walk. The intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker, you pulling them apart twice only to have chance put them back together. Yeah, all that seemed a little much. So, I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning. Have you been in here before? No, of course not. It seems like David Norris and Elise Sellas were meant to be together because they were meant to be together. Wait, what? In the '70s when he was born, they were meant to be together, same thing in the '80s, '90s. Wasn't till 2005 that the plan changed and she was supposed to stay with Adrian. <i>The problem here is there are remnants from all those old plans</i> <i>that keep pushing them together.</i> <i>They still feel like they belong with each other even though they don't,</i> <i>and we're about to tear them apart again.</i> You spend your whole career hoping, someday, you'll get a red-letter case. Something you can really make a name for yourself with. Finally you get one, and it's booby-trapped. What? I'm saying, it wasn't your fault. They were meant to be together. What? Were. In an earlier version of the plan. Actually, a dozen earlier versions. I always wondered how we had such bad luck that she was on that particular bus on that particular day. How could a plan just change like that? I don't know. It's above my pay grade. So, we're going operational. This is exciting. It's been a while. We're not going operational. No one ever made it to my job by taking stupid risks. So, what are we going to do? We're going to kick this case upstairs to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat. We're going to bring this to Thompson. Thompson? When he was in the field, his nickname was. "The Hammer," yes. He'll crush this little romance with a flick of his hand <i>and force them back on plan again.</i> I want to go to a club. Oh! Why ruin a really nice day? Come on. No, I don't dance. Everyone can dance. You just feel the music. Well, I've been told that I have trouble feeling. Who told you that? A long list of women. That's gross. You know what? Let's race to that lamppost. You win, I dance for you. I win, you dance for me. On the pole? If you like, yeah. This is serious. What are the rules? There are no rules. Oh! You bastard! Oh, my gosh! You challenged me in those shoes? Okay, fine. I can't. You're right. These are the wrong shoes. I'm going to twist an ankle. You said, "No rules. ' ' I avoided them. Ow! You said you had trouble feeling. Great. Hey, David. You're even cuter in person. Hey, it's David Norris. How you doing? How are you? How are we feeling about this tie? Hey, David Norris! Hey, how you doing? Maybe I should go home and get my tux. Definitely don't do that. It's good. I should never have come back here again without my backup dancers. I voted for you. How are you? Norris, you're a rock star! Did you grow up over here? Yeah, three blocks over that way. Pioneer Street. My whole childhood. What were you like as a kid? I've spent about half my time in the principal's office up until the sixth grade. Wow. Yeah, that was when my mother and my brother died within a month of each other. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. You know how I always tell that story about how I got inspired to go into politics because my dad took me to the Senate Gallery and we sat together and that's true. But what I leave out is he did that right after they died. And I was bottoming out. So, he wanted to get me out of here for a little while and he planned this road trip to DC, and I think it's because JFK was his idol. And we went and sat in the gallery. I remember watching him watch them, and I knew that that's what I wanted to do. I wish they were here to see all this. I was. Didn't expect to tell you any of that. David? David? <i>Hello? It's Adrian.</i> Hey. What are you doing? Why are you calling? Hi. No, I was. Because I was sleeping. No. No, it's not. Why are you calling? Okay, well, I got to go. No, I got to go. Okay. I'm so sorry. It's all right. Everything okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. That was so weird. I woke up and you weren't here. And then the phone rang and it was my ex which is just so strange. Sorry, I guess we hadn't gotten to any of that stuff yet. Right. You know, we broke up a while ago, and it's over and then he calls four times in one morning. He called you four times this morning? Mmm-hmm. How long have you guys been broken up? Um. Three months. It's like he knew I was with someone else. Was it serious? We were engaged. So, not really that serious? Right. Well, what happened? Do you want to know this? Yeah. He was a great guy. Brilliant choreographer and dancer, and we had the same group of friends. We had known each other a long time. Well, he sounds great. Why didn't you marry him? Because of you. I'm not some hopeless romantic. I've never allowed myself to be that way. But once I felt, even for a moment, what I felt with you. You ruined me. I didn't want to settle for less. I know the feeling. It scares the shit out of me. I'm not going to hurt you. You don't need to say that. I'm not going to hurt you. This is the first time in 25 years that I don't feel like I'm by myself. That's a lot of responsibility for me. I don't know if I'm quite comfortable with that. Well, too late. You know, I'm supposed to go to an interview right now. What if I told you I wasn't ready to let you out of my sight quite yet? Sounds good. You want to go? Yeah. All right. <i>Are you handsome</i> <i>or is it that Washington is so populated by</i> <i>I don't want to say, hideous abnormalities.</i> This is getting a little weird. David Norris, everybody. Excuse me, ma'am. Yes? Congressman Norris asked me to give you a message. He was just called into a meeting. He says it's urgent. Okay. He said he'll call you as soon as he's out and he'll see you at the show tonight. Okay, thank you. Thanks. This way, Congressman. Hello? Frustrating, isn't it? My name is Thompson. Whatever happened to free will? We actually tried free will before. After taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the Roman Empire, we stepped back to see how you would do on your own. You gave us the Dark Ages for five centuries until finally we decided we should come back in. The Chairman thought that maybe we just needed to do a better job with teaching you how to ride a bike before taking the training wheels off again. So, we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, scientific revolution. For 600 years we taught you to control your impulses with reason. Then in 1910, we stepped back again. Within 50 years, you had brought us World War I, the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust, and capped it off by bringing the entire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban missile crisis. At that point a decision was taken to step back in again before you did something that even we couldn't fix. You don't have free will, David. You have the appearance of free will. You expect me to believe that? I make decisions every day. You have free will over which toothpaste you use or which beverage to order at lunch. But humanity just isn't mature enough to control the important things. So, you handle the important things? The last time I checked, the world is a pretty screwed-up place. It's still here. If we had left things in your hands, it wouldn't be. Tell me why I can't be with Elise? Because the last guy didn't know. Meeting Elise at the Waldorf three years ago wasn't chance. That was us. We knew she would inspire you to give that speech. That speech that brought you back from the edge of oblivion and overnight made you the frontrunner in this coming election. What are you saying? You want me to win the election? This one and four more after it. And I'm not just talking about elections for Senate. You can matter, David. Really matter. What your father wanted when he took you to the Senate Gallery when you were 10. What your brother wanted when he made you promise the day before he overdosed that you wouldn't be like him. Why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people? That terrible emptiness when you're not. Don't do that. David, you can change the world, but that doesn't happen if you stay with her. Why do you people care who I love? It's not about her, it's about you. What being with her does to you. What it does to me? I'm better when I'm with her! Even you said it. The speech. In small doses, Elise was the cure. But in large doses, she rubs off on you. Stop. David, the president can't be a loose cannon. Stop talking. It's not working. Why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now? You've seen what we can do. You can't doubt we are who we say we are. Look, it's not about who you are, it's about who I am. Can't outrun your fate, David. I just disagree with you about what my fate is. I know what I feel for her and it's not going to change. All I have are the choices that I make. And I choose her come what may. It's 6:20. If you leave now, you can make Elise's show. She's a beautiful dancer. I thought I made myself clear. There is one more piece to this I haven't mentioned. I guess I just didn't have the heart. If you stay with her, it not only kills your dreams, it kills hers. What? Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country and eventually one of the world's greatest choreographers. If she stays with you, she ends up teaching dance to six-year-olds. When you look back at all this, David, just remember we tried to reason with you. I always hear people saying, "You can't blame yourself for what happens to other people," but in this case, really, you can. This is what you do, David. This is what you did getting into a bar fight the night you first got elected. <i>What you did to get that embarrassing photo in The New York Post.</i> We give you opportunities other people would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly helping you with this. <i>It's a sprain, David,</i> <i>but if you stay with her,</i> you'll take away the only thing she ever cared about. It's up to you. It's just a sprain. Yeah. The doctor said it's going to be better in a month or less. That's totally unexpected. I'm so relieved. Great. Great. You're such a great dancer, and you'll heal up and just get better and better. I'm going to go make a couple phone calls. Okay. Okay. I'm so happy for you. It's done. Thompson finished it. I know. You can't let it get to you like it did with his family. This is the job. <i>You ever wonder</i> <i>if it's right?</i> I mean, if it's always right? <i>Not like I used to.</i> Look, Chairman has the plan. We only see part of it. <i>I was talking to some friends of ours over in Monroe County this morning,</i> <i>and I said something to them that I think</i> <i>a lot of you may have heard me say before but it bears repeating.</i> <i>David Norris, who has spent the last two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area</i> <i>received some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll</i> <i>gave him a 16-point lead over his opponent</i> <i>less than a month before election day.</i> <i>Since his announcement 11 months ago,</i> <i>Norris has had a significant lead.</i> Hi. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thank you. I need it. Thank you. Who should I make it out to? My nephew, Miles. There you go. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Thank you. My pleasure. Pleasure. Can we get a picture with you? Sure, come on. Thank you. Thanks. Hey. I want to show you this, because you would find out eventually. I want to be here when you do. She's getting married to that guy she was engaged to. You okay? I think I'm going to. Take a day off. Hell, take a couple. We're 16 points up. Yeah, even I can't blow a lead that big. Congressman, good to see you again. Your friend just left you this. He said you would be stopping by. Why would you want to see me? Thompson was lying when he said you couldn't be with Elise because she brings out your reckless side. Then why? Why do they care so much? Because she's enough, David. If you have her, you won't need to fill that void inside of you with applause and votes and dreams of one day making it to the White House. That's important, but it's not the only thing that matters. Why are you so different from them? Your dad was a very smart man. He could have been a lot more. Wanted to be. Your brother, too. But the plan didn't call for it. What about my mother? That wasn't me. That wasn't us at all. It was just chance? I'm sorry. You know, Thompson is not lying. They're already talking about me being a presidential candidate. I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm 16 points up. The public loves you. Before I met Elise, that's all I cared about. I don't even notice it now. I can't stop thinking about her. Do you know where she's getting married? In front of a judge tomorrow morning. Is she happy? Thompson won't let you anywhere near her. Not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever. Harry. Is she happy? I got to try and get her back. Will you help me? Will you just help me get to her? They'll sense you coming a mile away. What if I could move as fast as you? Teach me about the doors. The rain will stop in the next hour, and that's the only thing keeping them from seeing us right now. If we're going to do this, we'll need all night to do it and a place surrounded by water to do it in. Always turn the doorknob clockwise. What happens if I turn it the other way? You don't want to do that. That's only for us. Put your hand on my shoulder and don't let go until we cross the threshold. Are these ever locked? Not when you're wearing one of our hats. Keep moving, David. Is this. It's the Museum of Modern Art. Yeah. Close the door. This is the city's main pumping station for downtown Manhattan. We're 10 blocks from the courthouse. Wait here. Hi, is the floor open? You okay, sweetie? Yeah, I just. I just feel like being on the floor. Lower Manhattan is layer upon layer of substrate. That's what we call the doors that have been added over time. Makes it a lot more complex to navigate downtown than it is uptown and a lot slower. Your destination, 60 Centre Street, Courtroom 300. There are thousands of different ways <i>to get to the courthouse using the doors.</i> I want you to learn how to stay in the substrate so Thompson won't be able to get a fix on you. <i>Okay. Just south of the diner, it's a red door.</i> I come out on Broadway, right by Leonard Street. That's good. Keep going. From Leonard, half a block down. Okay, suppose Thompson's there? Okay, I go east to Lafayette. No, it's Crosby Street there. Eight doors? I'm zigzagging all over the place. That will take me too long. But every time you go through a door, their plan books will lose track of you, so it's safer. <i>Look, I need you to understand this has never been done before.</i> So, the minute you go through that first door, all hell will break loose. <i>Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat.</i> I don't care if it's a Yankee cap, a bowler, or even a yarmulke. Assume everyone in a hat is working with Thompson. Even you guys can't get through the doors without your hats on, right? Right. <i>It's one of the ways the Chairman limits our power.</i> <i>Water is another way.</i> And you said before, what if Thompson's in front of me on Crosby Street? Right. Why don't I just knock the hat off his head and then run by him before he has time to pick it up? That's good, improvisation. We have trouble with that. The fastest way is actually if I go right for the blue door. <i>Yeah, but then you're exposed the entire way there.</i> That's a lot more dangerous than leapfrogging through doors. But if I make it, I'll take them completely by surprise. If you make it. <i>Come on, we have a lot more to get through.</i> Whatever it takes. Your father used to say that. I guess you're not supposed to identify with your subjects. You're not supposed to feel guilt. We're not built to lead with our emotions like you are, but that doesn't mean we don't have them. Some more than others. You're lucky, it started raining again. We need to get going. The wedding is in 10 minutes. We have time. Being early is just as bad as being late. Is your fiancée here? She's on her way in. Courtroom 300. You okay? Yeah. This is it. Okay. I'm going to go for the blue door. Of course. Here is your way through it. Don't lose it. Thanks, Harry. Good luck. Okay. It looks like Mr. Norris is using the rain to make a run for it. Call the proctor at the wedding. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just nervous, I guess. I just need a minute in the bathroom, okay? Sir, he's got a hat. He's in the substrate. He just went into the substrate. Whoa, whoa. No, no, no. It's an emergency. Sorry. Docket number 22, please come forward. We're next. Will you go check on her? Yeah. You're David Norris! Yeah, I got to go. Nothing in the hat. Go ahead. She's not even in there. Where is she? Where is she? Elise. You're not marrying that guy. I'm so sorry, and I don't know what you must think of me, but you can't marry him. You don't love him. I've been terrible, I know. I'm getting married. No, you can't. Don't touch me! What are you doing? Do you know that no one has ever hurt me as much as you did? I'm so sorry that I left you the way that I did. David, you know what? You left me in a fucking hospital. What are you doing? I know it seems terrible but there was a reason. You don't know anything about me and what makes me happy. I'm sorry that I hurt you. Oh, my God. Don't worry about him, he's with them. Just listen to me. Oh, my God, what did you do? Forget about him. What are you doing? Look at me, I know that you love me. Okay, this says that you love me and that I love you and that we're not supposed to be together. Because of this book. But I know that I'm supposed to be with you because of the way I feel. I love you and I don't care what happens. I want to spend the rest of my life with you even if it's only a little while. He just revealed us. Call the Intervention Team. <i>Tell them it's a square-one reset.</i> Mr. Thompson has deployed the Intervention Team. He's requesting an emergency Reset Authorization. I'll carry it in. Why are they chasing you? They're going to reset me. What are you talking about? I never lied to you. Down here. He's down here. I love you, Elise. I'm going to show you something. You deserve to know. What's going on? We got to keep moving. There is another door here. Got them. Sixth Avenue. Contain this. Oh, my God. What's happening to me? All you need to know, we're being chased. I need you to trust me. Okay. Okay, come on. Door, door, door! Find another door! What the hell is going on? What the hell is going on, David? Okay, I'm sorry. How did we just do that? I'm so sorry. These doors belong to the people who are chasing us. Who are they? I don't know what to call them, but they want to take you away from me. Why do they care about us? They hurt your ankle, Elise. Everything you've worked for your entire life, it doesn't happen if you stay with me. That's why I left you in the hospital. I don't understand. I don't understand. This can't be wrong. This can't be wrong. Why do they think it's wrong? The book. Their book. But what if I can find who wrote it? Okay, I can go through this door alone. You'll never see me or the people chasing us again. Or you could come with me, and I don't know what's on the other side, but I know you would be next to me, and that's all I've wanted since the minute I met you. I'm coming with you. Okay. Take the other one. Turn it to the left. To the left. Oh, my God. Hey! You can't be in here. Stop, sir! Hold them up! Come on. Stop them! Harry Mitchell, they want you in the Chairman's office. Immediately. Come on. Hey! Hey! How did you get in here? Search the room! Shit! Go back. No. Oh, my God. I love you. I love you. Did you really think you could reach the Chairman? And change your fate if you did? Or write your own? It doesn't work like that and I told you why. I've got a message for you. I understand. Even Thompson has a boss. Harry? You're the Chairman? No. You've met him though, or her. Everybody has. The Chairman comes in a different form to everyone so people rarely realize when it happens. Is this some sort of test? In a way, it's all a test, for everybody, even the members of the Adjustment Bureau. David, you risked everything for Elise. And Elise, when you came through that door at the Statue of Liberty, you risked everything, too. But you inspired me. It seems like you inspired the Chairman, too. Is that about us? Yes. What does it say? It says that this situation between the two of you is a serious deviation from the plan. So, the Chairman rewrote it. Okay. Now what? Now. You can take the stairs. <i>Most people live life on the path we set for them.</i> <i>Too afraid to explore any other.</i> <i>But once in a while, people like you come along</i> <i>who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way.</i> <i>People who realize free will is a gift you'll never know how to use</i> <i>until you fight for it.</i> <i>I think that's the Chairman's real plan</i> <i>that maybe one day</i> <i>we won't write the plan.</i> <i>You will.</i> Sub.Re-Edit.by. :: npdv.indoheroes[at]gmail.com :: 'The history of every major Galactic civilisation 'passes through three distinct and recognisable phases: 'For instance, the first phase is characterised by the question: 'The second by the question: 'The third by the question: 'Though it will take a large civilisation thousands of years 'to pass through the how, why and where phases, 'small social groupings under stressful conditions 'can pass through these phases with extreme rapidity thus.' How are doing? Badly. Why? Shut up! Excitement and adventure and really wild things. 'Excitement and adventure and really wild things 'have been dogging Arthur Dent for some days. 'He's had his planet demolished to make way for a hyperspace by-pass, 'and has been confronted with the disconcerting knowledge 'that the Earth was not what it appeared, 'but was in fact a gigantic super-computer 'designed to calculate the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. 'The answer to which is now known to be: 'He and his companions have been blasted far forward in time 'to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, 'from which they're returning in a ship 'which could not in all honesty be said to belong to them. 'Can they now relax for a while and take stock? 'No. 'The ship does in fact belong to Disaster Area, 'a plutonium rock band whose stage act traditionally ends 'with a black stunt ship on autopilot crashing into the heart of a nearby sun. 'Of this, however, Arthur Dent and his companions are totally unaware. 'They decide to relax for a while and take stock.' Listen, Earthman, you've a job to do. The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right? There's a lot of loot in that head thing of yours. Where do we start? The Ultimate Answer's 42. What's the question? How should I know? It could be anything. What's six times seven? - 42! - Yes, I know that. I'm just saying it could be anything. Why ask me? 'Cause you were the last one! You were there at the Big Firework! - I wish you'd stop saying that. - I know. Shut up, this is organism talk. It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns, but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in that. You can read my mind? - Yes. - And? It amazes me how you manage to live in anything that small. Abuse! Ignore him, he's only making it up. Making it up? Why should I want to do that? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it. Marvin, if you knew all along, why didn't you tell us? - You didn't ask. - We're asking now. What's the question? - The Ultimate Question? - Yes! - Of Life, the Universe and Everything? - Yeah! - To which the answer is 42? - Yeah, come on! You're not really interested. This ship knows where it's going better than we do. I could tell you weren't really interested. - Who does this ship belong to? - Me. - Who does it really belong to?! - Really me! Property is theft, right? Therefore theft is property, therefore this ship is mine. - Tell the ship that. - Ship! This is your new owner speaking! <i>OK, channel 9</i> <i>on power. Testing channel 15. <i>Channel 15, A-OK.</i> <i>Now in pre-sundive position. <i>Put in under control</i> <i>of central-stage coordination. <i>Ship locked into stage computer A-OK.</i> <i>Stand by for sundive. - Turn it off! - What does sundive mean? The ship is going to dive into the sun. Sun. Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you steal Disaster Area's stunt ship? Marvin, what makes you think it's Disaster Area's stunt ship? Simple. I parked it for them. Then why.? Why didn't you tell us?! You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things. This is awful! That's what I said. Hi, there, Galactic rock fans! Fine weather for the concert this afternoon. I'm standing here on stage in the desert, and with my hyper-binoctic glasses I can just make out the huge audience on the horizon all around. Behind me, huge speaker stacks rise like a cliff face, high above the sun is shining and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know and claim the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes and other things they always go on about. But I've just heard that Disaster Area met with the environmentalists and had them shot! <i>So now nothing stands in the way</i> <i>of the concert going ahead today. - Know what I'm thinking? - I think so. Tell me what you think I'm thinking. - It's time to get off this ship. - I think you're right. I think you're right. - How? - Quiet, we're thinking. So this is it? We're going to die. I wish you'd stop saying that. 'One of the things Ford Prefect found hard to understand about human beings 'was their habit of continually stating and re-stating the very, very obvious, as in: 'First, Ford formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. 'lf human beings don't exercise their lips, he thought, 'their mouths probably seize up. 'After a while, he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. 'lf they don't exercise their lips, he thought, 'their brains start working. 'In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcerebon People 'of Kakrafoon Kappa. 'The Belcerebons used to cause great resentment amongst neighbouring races 'by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished 'and, above all, quiet civilisations in the Galaxy. 'As a punishment for this behaviour, 'which was held to be offensively self-righteous and provocative, 'a Galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases: 'telepathy. 'Now, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought 'to anyone within a five-mile radius, 'they have to talk loudly and continuously about the weather, 'their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon 'and what a noisy place Kakrafoon has suddenly become. 'Another method of temporarily blotting out their mind is to play host 'to a Disaster Area concert.' This is it! We're starting to dive! We're heading straight into the sun! - How many escape capsules are there? - None! - You counted them? - Twice! Raise the crew on the radio? - I said there were people on board. - And they said? "Hi, there!" - You told them who you were? - Yeah. They said it was a great honour. What does "teleport" mean? What did you say? - Probably the wrong moment. - Where's the teleport? Under this sign that says "Out of order". There. Hell's donkeys! It seems OK. Just the automatic where-we're-going system is cocked up. - Who cares? Let's just go! - Someone has to operate it manually. - Whoever it was would. would. - Wouldn't Escape. Hey, Marvin, kid! How you doing? Very badly, I suspect. - How would you like to lay down my life selflessly for you? - Make the ultimate sacrifice? - Yeah. Consign my brain, which is the size of a planet, to death in a blazing sun, so that you can all pursue your futile little lives? Yeah. Nothing personal. You don't count as a person, do you, kid? All right. - Come on, guys! - Better all get into the teleport. Marvin, you stupid tin can, shift it! We really appreciate this. I suppose some people might expect better treatment after having waited 576,000 million years in a car park. But not me. I may just be a menial robot, but I'm far too intelligent to expect anyone to think of me for a moment. Ford? Ford? Ford? Arthur! - Arthur! - Ford! - Zaph? - Trillian? Where've they got to? There's no reason why we should all end up in the same place. - Ah, well. - Trillian? They could be anywhere. So could we, for that matter. Zaphod? What's that? Feet! Let's move! - That's the way they're coming from. - No, that's the way! You're right! This way! Joggers! - A funeral parlour? - Wild! - What's so great about dead people? - I dunno. What is so great? Look, a plaque. And a serial number. - A dead telephone sanitiser? - Best kind. - What's he doing here? - Not a lot! This one's a hairdresser. This one's an advertising account executive. A second-hand car salesman, third class. Are you sure these are coffins? They're terribly cold. All right! Put your hands up and turn around slowly. - Why isn't anyone ever pleased to see us? - You're my prisoners. - All right. - Move! Move! - Move? - Move! Left, right, left, right! Keep in line! Left, right, left, right! Left, right, one, two, three! - Captain? - Yes, Number Three? I've had a sort of report-thingy from Number One. - Oh, dear. - Something about finding prisoners. Perhaps it'll keep him happy for a bit. He's always wanted some. - Captain, sir! - Hello, Number One. Having a nice day? I've brought the prisoners from Freezer Base 7, sir. Hello! Excuse me not getting up, just having a quick bath. Well, gin and tonics all round, then! Look in the fridge, Number Three! Certainly, sir! Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners, sir? Why on Golgafrincham should I do that? To get information out of them, sir, find out why they came here. No, no. I expect they just dropped in for a quick gin and tonic, don't you? But, sir. they're my prisoners. Can't I interrogate them a little bit? Oh, very well. - Ask them what they want to drink. - Thank you, sir. All right. You scum! - You vermin! - Steady on, Number One! What do you want to drink? Gin and tonic sounds very nice to me. Arthur? Yes! With ice or without? With, please. Lemon? Yeah. Do you have any of those little biscuits, the cheesy ones? I'm asking the questions. Number One, push off, will you? I'm trying to take a relaxing bath. May I respectfully remind you that you've been in that bath for over three years? Well, one needs to relax a lot in a job like mine. Can I just.? Could I just ask you what your job is? - Your drinks. - Thanks. - I couldn't help noticing the bodies. - Bodies? Dead telephone sanitisers and account executives. They're not dead, no! They're just frozen. They'll be revived. - You've a hold full of frozen hairdressers? - Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers. Security guards, public relations executives. Management consultants. We're going to colonise another planet. - What? - Exciting, isn't it? - With that lot?! - Don't misunderstand me. We're just one of the ships of the Ark Fleet. We're the B Ark. Excuse me, could you run a little more hot water for me? - Yes, sure. - Thanks. - What's a B Ark? - Well, our planet was doomed. - Doomed? - Yes, so everybody said, <i>Let's pack the whole population</i> into giant spaceships <i>and settle on another planet.</i> - A less doomed one? Precisely. So it was decided to build three gigantic ships. Three gigantic Arks in space. The idea was that into the first ship would go all the brilliant leaders, scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers. Into the third ship would go all the people who do the actual work, who make things and do things. Then into the B ship-that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen. Of course, we were sent off first. - What was wrong with your planet? - It was doomed. Apparently it was going to blow up or crash into the sun or something. That's not what I was told. My commander swore that the entire planet was about to be eaten by a mutant star goat. - Really? - Yes. He said how lucky I was to be going off in the first ship. But they made sure they sent all you lot off first, anyway. Oh, yes! And everyone said - very nice I thought - how important for morale to feel that they were arriving on another planet where you could get a good haircut and where the phones were clean. Yes. I can see that'd be very important. - Can you? - Sh! And the rest of the ships followed on after you? Funny you should mention that, 'cause curiously enough we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago, yet they must be behind us somewhere. Yes. Unless they're all eaten by the goat? The goat! Funny. Now that I come to tell the story to someone else. Don't you find it a bit odd, Number Three? - Well. - It is a bit odd, isn't it? - It's odd. - Yes, well. I can see you've a lot to talk about. So thanks for the drink. Could you drop us off at the nearest convenient planet? That's a little difficult, you see. Our trajectory thingy was pre-set before we left Golgafrincham. I think it was partly due to the fact I'm not really very good at figures. You mean. We're stuck here on this ship? When are you going to arrive at this planet? We're nearly there. Nearly there. I should be out of this bath, in fact. Oh, why stop just when I'm enjoying it? - We are about to land, then? - Not exactly land, no. As far as I remember, we were programmed to crash on it. Crash?! Some reason for it, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was. You're all a load of useless bloody loonies! Yes, that was it! That was the reason! 'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy has this to say about Golgafrincham: 'Meanwhile, the remaining useless third crash-landed 'into the prehistoric dawn of a small blue-green planet 'at the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy.' It's odd, isn't it? 'With them are Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. 'They, too, have been travelling widely in distant lands. 'Something is bothering them.' It's very, very odd. There is one way to find out, of course. - What, you mean by going to.? - Yes. All right. I said it was odd. Yes, I remember you saying. I can hardly believe it. I find it very easy to believe things. I wonder how the Golgafrinchans are doing? Do you? All right! I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order, if possible. - Fancy a light trim, sir? - Not now, I'm in the bath! - Anyone else like one? - Please, we're trying to have a meeting. - If you'd all care to look at the agenda. <i>- Hello! Hello! Who's that? Remember me? I. I made a discovery. I'd like to tell you about. - Is it on the agenda? - Agenda? Sorry, but speaking as a management consultant, I must insist on the importance of the committee structure. - On a prehistoric planet? - Address the chair! - There isn't a chair, only a rock. - Call it a chair. Why not call it a rock? Will you two shut up?! - I want to table a motion. - Boulder a motion, you mean! Thank you, I made that point. - Order, order! - If I could just say. Order, order! I would like to call to order the 573rd meeting of the colonisation committee of the planet of Fintlewoodlewix. This is futile! 573 meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet! If you care to look at the agenda, we are having a report from the Hairdressers' Fire Development Sub-committee. That's me. That's you? What have you done? Well. they gave me a couple of sticks. Yes. And? Curling tongs? You're going to die out, you know that? You are obviously being totally naive! When you've been in marketing as long as I have, you know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to its image. - Stick it up your nose! - Precisely what we need to know. Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally? And the wheel! What about this wheel thing? They say it's a fascinating project. We're having a little difficulty there. Difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe! All right, Mr Wiseguy! You're so clever, you tell us what colour it should be! O Mighty Zarquon! - Has no one done anything yet? - Yes! I have declared war on the next continent. Declared war? There's no one living there. Yes. But there will be one day. - So we've left an open-ended ultimatum. - What? And blown up a few military installations. - Military installations, Number Two? - Yes, sir. Well, potential military installations. All right, trees. And we interrogated a gazelle. And one of our surviving film producers rescued a camera from the wreckage. He wants to make a documentary about you, Captain. That's awfully nice. Yes, he's got a really strong angle on it. The burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command. I wouldn't overstress that angle. After all, one's never alone with a rubber duck. If we could move on to the subject of fiscal policy? Fiscal policy? How can you have money if none of you produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees. But since we decided to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have all of course become immensely rich. But we have run into a small inflation problem owing to high leaf availability. That means the current rate is something like three major deciduous forests buy one ship's peanut. In order to obviate this problem and revalue the leaf, we've decided on an extensive campaign of defoliation and burn down all the forests. - I think that's a sensible move, don't you? - Fiscally shrewd! Fiscally shrewd! You're mad, you know that, don't you? Is it appropriate to inquire what you've been doing all this time? You and that other interloper, missing for months? We've been travelling. We've. We've been trying to find out something about this world. That does not sound very productive to me. No. Well, have I got news for you! It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingos' kidneys what you do. Burn down the forests. It won't make a scrap of difference. You see, I've seen the future. Two million years you've got, and that's it! At the end of that time, your race will be dead. Gone. And good riddance. Remember that. Two million years. Strange chap. What about those documentary things? Just time for another bath! Sponge, somebody! No, no, no! Honestly! "Y" scores five, and it's on a triple word score. I explained the rules. No, no, please! Put down the jawbone. All right, we'll start again. Please try and concentrate this time. Hi, Arthur, what are you doing? I'm trying to teach them Scrabble. It's uphill work. The only word they know is "Ugh", and they can't spell it. - What's the point in that? - To make them evolve. Imagine a world descended from those cretins over there! - We don't have to, we've seen it. - But honestly! We've seen it. There's no escape. - Did you tell them what we discovered? - What? Norway. Slartibartfast's signature on the glacier. - What'll that mean to them? - It means this is the Earth! - My home. Where I was born. - Was? - Will be. - In two million years' time. Tell them that and see what they say. They'll chase you up a tree! Face it. Those zeebs over there are your ancestors. Your Scrabble board won't save your race. The human race is currently standing around a bath making documentaries! - Surely we can do something? - It's all been done, we've seen it. You know the history of the Earth and its demolition by the Vogons. You can't change anything. And all because the Golgafrinchans arrived here on their B Ark! Ah, well. Poor bloody cavemen! It's all been a waste of time for you, hasn't it? Out-evolved by a telephone sanitiser! - He's pointing at the Scrabble board. - Probably spelt "library" with one R. No, he hasn't. No, look! The experiment! 42! Deep Thought's answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and whatever! Everything! 42! Of course! The experiment to find the question to that answer. It's going on all around us, here. The Earth. The ground. The trees. The water. The rocks. The cavemen. Terrific! We've cocked it up. The Golgafrinchans, us, just by arriving here. The caveman is part of the program, and they're dying out because of us. Therefore, no question. - What about my brain? - What about your brain? Marvin said the question was printed in my brainwave patterns. - Wrong question. It's still cocked-up. - It might give us a clue. If it's in your brain, how are we going to get at it? How about. if it's in my brain, and I can't reach it, suppose we introduce some random element - Shaped by the brainwave patterns? - Such as? Pulling out letters from the Scrabble bag. - Brilliant! - Right! Right. First four letters. W. H. A. T. What. Great. It's working. D. O. Y. Doy. Doyo! U. G. Doyoug? Ah! E. T. Do you get. What do you get. If. Y. O. U. M. U. Multi. P. Multiply! S. I. x. Six. by. N. I. N. E. Nine! Six. by. nine. Is that it? That's it. Six by nine? 42.? I always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the Universe. All for that! Yep! It's very sad, you know. Just at the moment it's a very beautiful planet. It is. It is indeed. The rich primal greens. The river snaking off into the distance. The burning forests. And then in two million years, BANG! It gets destroyed by the Vogons. What a life for a young planet to look forward to! What a waste! Well, better than some. I read of one planet up in the 7th Dimension got used as a ball in inter-Galactic bar billiards, got potted straight into a black hole, killed 10 billion people. Madness, total madness! Only scored thirty points, too. Where did you read that? Hm? A book. - What book? - The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. That thing! <i>"Save the planet."</i> <i>Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,</i> <i>I've had to laugh.</i> <i>"Save the planet."</i> <i>What for? And from what?</i> <i>From ourselves?</i> <i>Life's simple:</i> <i>Kill or be killed,</i> <i>don't get involved.</i> <i>. and always finish the job.</i> <i>The survivor's code.</i> <i>My code.</i> <i>And it all sounds great until the day you</i> <i>find yourself confronted by a choice.</i> <i>A choice to make a difference,</i> <i>to help someone.</i> <i>. or to walk away and save yourself.</i> <i>I learned something that day.</i> <i>You can't always walk away.</i> <i>Too bad it was the day I died.</i> Get out here! Come here! Get back! You remember me? You sold me a gun that don't work! You almost got me killed! I paid $20 for this. I want my money back. Give me that. This one's very good, very good. Okay. I owe you. I'll save you some. Hey, Toorop. Toorop. Somebody came here looking for you. Okay. <i>Boy, what a massacre.</i> <i>At the peak of the rush hour,</i> <i>bombs were detonated in.</i> Karl, is that you? I thought you were in Sudan killing babies. Remember the last time we met? I told you if you ever point that gun at me again l'd kill you. Who would hire a baby killer to get me? Who? No shit. If you wanted me dead, you'd have blown up the building. Who? Gorsky. Karl, you're a disgrace to the profession. You're not a mercenary, you're a terrorist. You need two things to live in this business, your balls and your word. You don't have either. You know the difference between you and me, Karl? I still got both. Take it easy. Personal between him and me. You are a hard man to find, Toorop. I'm not hiding. You could have knocked. I needed to be sure that you were the same idealist who worked for me 10 years ago. So you knew I was gonna kill Karl? I don't like you, Gorsky. You can't trust me and I can't trust you. Look at you. Still in this shit hole, surviving. No friends, no family, no future. We are the same. You and me. We're not the same. What do you want? I need a smuggler. I don't do refugees anymore. Use your own cargo. - You own the borders anyway. - Only on this side. - This is an overseas delivery? - A girl. She needs to be in America in six days. Why are you playing with me? You know I can't get back into that country. You know that U.N. passports are impossible to fake. This is not a fake. Inject it in your neck when you pass the official border. This is your new life. I'll do it for half a mil. I can make you do it for free. You can't make me do shit, Gorsky. But you can pay me what I need so I can get the job done right. A car will pick you up outside. Everything you need will be in the trunk. Cross me and you'll have no place to hide anymore Toorop. It goes both ways Gorsky. Shit. Good morning. You must be Toorop. I am Sister Rebeka. I want to bring three simple rules to your attention before we start our journey. We? I'm here to pick up one girl. Wherever she goes, I go. That is rule number one. Rule number two, the less contact she has with the outside world, the better. You're here to protect her from outside influences. That includes seeing, hearing and feeling. Now, it's a harsh world out there, Sister. I know. That is why we live in here. Shit. Okay, what's your third rule? No foul language. Do we have an agreement? You listen to my one and only rule. Don't fuck with me or I'll leave you standing in the middle of nowhere with nothing but your ass to sell to get back here your perfect world. Do we have an agreement? Obviously, you are not a gentleman. Obviously not. Now that we have an understanding, pick up the bags. No. What's your name? My name? You don't have to talk to him. You didn't introduce yourself. My name is Toorop. - Are you taking us to New York? - Yes. Now please get into the car. Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop? Look, lady. I'm just a delivery boy. And to me you're just a package. I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother, I'm not your boyfriend. In six days, I'm gonna deliver you and never see you again. Sister Rebeka's right. We shouldn't even talk. Come on. Comfy? Your Highness, your child has left the convent. At last. Six days until we reveal our miracle to the world. Your Highness, the press conference will begin shortly. She's coming. Let's pray. Let's hurry up. The train's gonna leave soon. Take your bags. Are you really going to need all that? You can never have enough firepower, Sister. In fact. Never touched a gun in my life. Now would be the perfect moment to start. No, thank you. I can defend myself. Stay close, this is the real world. There's no mercy for the weak. Just because we're peaceful, that doesn't mean we're weak. It does here. Hurry. Change. What are you doing? <i>We've located the targets.</i> <i>Contact New York.</i> <i>Patch me through to Darquandier.</i> They found her. Okay. Be careful now. Noelites would be watching too. My daughter must not be harmed. <i>Put this on.</i> Come on. I'm scared. Can I hold your hand? Hold mine. Hang on. Okay, give me three. Hey. Where are you going? What are you doing? Come on. Hey. Hey! Hey, come here. Hey! <i>- She's on the run.</i> <i>- Hey.</i> Aurora. Toorop. Aurora. Toorop. - What are you doing? <i>- Stop.</i> - Don't go that way. - She's not used to crowds. We have to go. We have no time. - Now. - We have to get away. What's wrong? Make her walk or I'll carry her. - Stop. Don't touch her. - We gotta leave. We're going. - Don't touch her. - You will die. No! Come on. We're going to the train. We need to catch it. Come on. Move. Get out of the way. Move! Those tigers in the cage. They weren't real, right? Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017. The last one died in the Moscow Zoo. What is she, a walking wildlife encyclopedia? They were clones? Second generation clones. Not real tigers. Copies of copies. But they're living creatures. Made by God. No, they were organic machines made by man. God made man in his image so, what man creates is also God's will. Is this what you teach her in the convent? You wanna talk? Tell me what happened at the marketplace. How did you know about the explosion? If I'm gonna protect you I need to know what's wrong with you. She was scared. It's her first time out of the convent. And you put us in that situation. <i>Your attention, please. We are about to</i> <i>pass through high-radiation smog.</i> <i>For your security,</i> <i>the shutters will now be lowered.</i> First time out of the convent, huh? Stay close. - What are we doing here? - Looking for a friend. Must be somewhere around here. Come on, come on. It's a glorious game. Marcus from gracious England against the Killa from China. Only one round. You can make it. <i>I got them. They're right here.</i> <i>I'll be right there in a minute.</i> <i>And you, don't talk to anybody.</i> They're splitting up. What do we do now? Everybody maintain their position. Get up, Finn. Hey, Toorop. - How are you? - How are you doing? What you doing in this beautiful part of Russia? <i>- Working.</i> <i>- Working for who?</i> <i>Hey, hey, two shots.</i> <i>Gorsky.</i> He made me an offer I couldn't refuse. - What can I do for you? - I need three passes on the boat. And two snow bikes on the other side. - You crossing? - I'm delivering. A girl. Her? Who is she? I don't know. - Where are you taking her? - America. You're on the terrorist list there. - Yeah. - You know that. You need a passport. You need an identity. You're kidding me. You got a passport? Yeah, and I'm not coming back. - That is a bold move. - I got 50 G's saying you can help out. When? Now. You don't have to look. Who is he? He's a lost soul. See you at the landing at 0600 sharp. You got it. - Who is that? - An old friend, a good smuggler. - You trust him? - I don't trust anybody. Come on. - Sorry, kids, these girls are with me. - Just let her go, Toorop. - How do you know my name? - We know a lot of things you don't. - Yeah? Like what? - Like you don't know what you're doing. - I'm doing my job. - Forget your job. - What? - One million, tax-free. Take the money and walk out without a fight. Make it easy on yourself, Toorop. Go! Move! Aurora. Hey! - Aurora. - Hey, man, let the girl go. Just let her go. Let her go. Another one is about to die. A new opponent for the Killa. Hey, man, hey, hey. I don't. Get over there. Wanna fight? Let's go. No! Aurora. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Don't kill him. He doesn't want to hurt me. He wanted to protect me! Your father sent us. - My father? - Yes, your father. Get away from her. Get away from her. It's okay, Aurora. - I have to know. - No, Aurora. Aurora? Aurora. Aurora! Listen to me. Stop. Toorop. Toorop. Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. Come on. Move it. Come on. Go, go, go. Let her go! Next one dies. Come with us. They're ready to die for you. I don't want anybody to die for me. What do you think you're doing? - What's wrong with you? - Think this is a game? - Why did you shoot? - Trying to get killed? - Why didn't you let me go? - You don't know them! And what are you gonna do? Shoot me in the head? Swing on me like an animal? Stop it. I told you I'd take you to New York. And I will. You don't have to like me. Is my father really alive? No, baby girl. He died. This is way too many refugees, man. The ice is getting thinner every year. We're losing cargo all the time. We're not gonna all get on the boat. Make sure we do. This goddamn global warming is bad for business. What's happening? Watch this. There's not much time. They don't wanna be spotted by satellites. Hurry, come on. <i>Diving in two minutes.</i> <i>Diving in one minute.</i> <i>One minute.</i> Go. Come on. No! No! You can't do this. They'll die out there. No! - You can't do this. - Get away from the controls. - What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it. - No. Don't do that. What's wrong? - Put it down. - No, don't. - Hey, hey, hey. - You, put it down. - Hey, take it easy. - Hey, take it easy. - Put it down. - We go back up. - Now. - Okay, okay. - Relax. - We go back up. - Easy. - Now. - Relax, stay put. - No. Calm down. - Put her on the floor. - I feel them dying. No, no mercy. Dead! Jesus, Mary and Joseph. What the hell was that? I was 17 years old, living in San Francisco. My life was a mess. I met the wrong man. I was lost in darkness. But the high priestess of our church opened the doors that led onto the path of light. I joined the Noelites and I ended up in the convent. It was a haven for women who needed to heal. I worked in the orphanage. She arrived. A little baby. Her father was dead. Nobody knew anything about the mother. I took her as my own. I fed her. I taught her. Everything was fine until three months ago. The doctor came and gave her a pill. He was with her for 10 minutes and then she slowly started. To change, huh? Schizophrenia. Spasms. Nothing as violent as what you saw today. Now, how could she know how to operate a 30-year-old Russian sub? She's always known things that she never experienced. Aurora could speak when she was 2 years old. Yeah, but there are kids that can speak at 2 years old. Nineteen different languages? Who else knows about this? Nobody but the doctor. He told me to keep it a secret to protect her. He said that we would get the best medical help in America. She needs help. <i>Crew, prepare to surface.</i> Get her ready. You know, two years ago in Uzbekistan, I saw this viral bomb go off. I saw it from the air. It was incredible. Everybody died. She's carrying, ain't she? All the symptoms fit. All that weird behavior. I'm telling you, man, she's carrying a weapon. Do you have any idea how much money she's worth? If she's carrying a virus l'll kill her myself and burn the body. What happened to them? Fighter drones. Anything that moves is shot on sight. It's 10 miles to the DMZ. Then let's make it 10 fast miles. Let's go. Toorop, they're coming. Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it! Brake! Finn, get close to me. Jump onto his bike. I'll draw them off. - What are you doing? - Toorop cleared our way out. We're only a mile from the border. - Toorop, we need help. - Don't worry. We're almost there. Toorop, we need you now. Hang on, I'm getting there. Stop! We have to get Toorop. Toorop. He's not dead. Oh, shit. Hey, stay with me. He's not reacting. He's bleeding to death. I need your help. Okay. We gotta get out of here now. It's a small piece of metal. I'm gonna take it out. - What do you need? - Just hold him. Look, we don't have time for this, okay? They're gonna send more drones. Aurora? - You got it? - I got it. - He's okay. - Give me a bandage. We should never have turned back. He knows the rules. I'll sew it up later. Hey now you and the passport are mine. - What are you doing? - You, I don't need. Like I said trust no one. Remember that. It's good. Where did you learn to cook? Rule number one in the mercenary handbook. You never had a woman take care of you? Sorry. No, not in my line of work. Finished. - She gets pleasure out of this. - Crybaby. Crybaby? What is that? Painkiller? No, thank you. - Live a little. - No. - Aurora, stop. - Wait, let. Spit it out. Girls. We made it across the border. Here's to survival and thank you for saving my life. Maybe now you can trust somebody. We protected each other like family. We are all going to die in New York. Good night. She's just scared. Yeah, right. Go back to sleep. We still have a long way ahead of us. What are you doing? We go through customs tomorrow. Can't take these. You know, when Sister Rebeka first found me as a baby it was a night like this. Aurora. That's where I got my name. From the chaos. It suits you. You're risking your life for me. Why? I've done my time. All this killing and pain and war for what? I'm tired. I'm tired of it all. You're my only chance out of this hell. And go where? 27 Cedar Grove near Canada. It's upstate New York. My parents had a farm. More like a cabin with a lot of land. It's probably in ruins, but I might be able to fix it up. There is no place like home. Well, Kansas ain't what it used to be. <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> 1939. That's right. Toorop. Are you really going to kill me and burn my body? I hope I won't have to. Thirty minutes. The bus leaves in 30 minutes. There's a plane to New York in two hours. <i>Passengers for Flight 712</i> <i>to New York.</i> <i>. please proceed to Gate 211</i> <i>for immediate boarding.</i> <i>You are now leaving Canada.</i> <i>We hope you enjoyed your stay.</i> <i>Welcome</i> <i>to the United States of America.</i> Welcome to America. Welcome to America. Welcome to America. Stop. Hold it right there. - Hey. - I said, hold it. - Calm down. - Hey. <i>A miracle in the making.</i> <i>Tomorrow is the dawn</i> <i>of our new age.</i> Harlem, we've changed. We've changed. Right here, girls. It's okay. It's safe here. Here. Can we turn it off? You can't turn it off. You can change the channel. Hey. There's no food. Because we're not gonna be here long. What's wrong? They're all dead. <i>Sources report the destruction in</i> <i>Kirghizstan of a 1000-year-old convent.</i> <i>One of the oldest continually functioning</i> <i>convents in Central Asia.</i> <i>Now occupied by an ascetic branch</i> <i>of the Noelites.</i> <i>. the convent was struck by a missile</i> <i>late last night.</i> <i>There were no survivors.</i> <i>Here, an initial reaction</i> <i>from the Noelites.</i> <i>It is a tragedy to think</i> <i>that even defenseless women.</i> <i>. who made the choice to withdraw</i> <i>from society and lead a life of purity.</i> <i>. should suffer the attacks</i> <i>of terrorists.</i> <i>. who have absolutely no respect for</i> <i>the lives of decent, God-fearing people.</i> <i>We shall mourn our Sisters.</i> <i>The Noelites have been persecuted</i> <i>for too long.</i> <i>Tomorrow will be the dawn</i> <i>of our new age.</i> <i>Congratulations, my friend.</i> <i>You made it safe and sound.</i> Gorsky. - Did you destroy that convent? <i>- I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.</i> <i>- I'm a mercenary like you.</i> - Bullshit. What the hell is going.? What the hell is going on over here? - You didn't leave me a gun? <i>- You've done your job.</i> <i>When you turn over the girl, I'll get paid</i> <i>and you're home free.</i> <i>And the tracking device in your passport</i> <i>will be deactivated.</i> <i>Deliver the package.</i> <i>My men will be there</i> <i>to be sure you do.</i> They never hurt anybody. Maybe it was an accident. It was not an accident. It was destroyed right after we crossed the border. Would you like to pray with me? I don't feel like praying anymore. Toorop said I'm just a package to him. Is that all I am to you? Of course not. I love you. How is she? Scared. Yeah, well, she should be. Who are they? To the left, the Range Rover goons work for your sect, the Noelites. To the right the bikers work for Gorsky. They're all here to make sure I deliver. And if we don't? It's gonna be a free-for-all. Look, Sister. We traveled 6000 miles together. The truth is this has been a suicide mission from the beginning. They won't let either one of us walk out of here alive. That's the doctor that came to the convent three months ago. Answer the door. Act like nothing's wrong. Okay. - Good evening, Sister. - Good evening. Good evening. Where is she? In the room. You're a bad man. Thank you, Aurora. Thank you so much. - How is she? - She's fine. I have to run some more tests. - More tests? - Standard. You just ran your test. - What's wrong with her? - Expect a call. What is wrong with her? Toorop. Toorop, let him go. If you please? Thank you, Sister. - Get over here. - What's wrong with you? I wanna know everything. Don't you think that if I knew anything, I would tell you? No, I don't think. You're a Noelite. You are like him. You swore an oath. Not to them. To God. God has nothing to do with it now. You understand? If she carries a virus, she could annihilate the city. I'm not gonna have it on my conscience. I'm pregnant. Twins. It's not possible. I've watched over you all your life. No one's ever touched you. - And nobody has. - It's a miracle. Shit. - Hello. <i>- Mr. Toorop, this is the High Priestess.</i> <i>- I am the.</i> - I know who you are. <i>Thank you for doing such a good job,</i> <i>Mr. Toorop.</i> You're welcome. <i>Bring the girl to the limousine</i> <i>and you'll be free.</i> - Toorop. <i>.and rich.</i> .if you deliver me to them, I'll die. We're on our way out. <i>All right, guys.</i> <i>Let's go get her. Are you ready?</i> We can't let her go, Toorop. Look around. Do we have a choice? She's your problem now. Move! We're going to the subway. Thank you, Toorop. What's wrong? It's a missile linked to my passport. How can you stop it? - I got him! - Only by death. Go to the subway. Toorop. Aurora. Get the girl. It's you. Protect them. I need you to live. Aurora was our miracle. A true virgin birth. This was to make ours the dominant religion on earth. Now we don't know what's happened to her. In this mess, there's no sign of Aurora. We can't find her. We were finally on the verge of becoming a bona fide religion. Your incompetence has thrown 20 years of careful planning down the tubes. Who gave the order to use guns to retrieve her? You left Gorsky no choice. What were you thinking? - Your Highness. - What? The body stolen from the morgue was Toorop's. The police have found the van that transported him to New Jersey. Who would want to abduct the body of a dead man? He's back online. Where are you taking me? To Darquandier. Jamal, Mr. Toorop is not our prisoner. You can release him. Good evening, Mr. Toorop. I'm Dr. Darquandier. Aurora's father. I thought you were dead. It's sometimes useful to be dead. It allows one a second chance. You'll see. Oh, yes. You we're clinically dead for two hours. We lost time getting you from the morgue. And then you went into a coma for five days. I fixed you up as best I could. Now, Mr. Toorop, I believe I owe you some explanation. Twenty years ago, I was drummed out of the medical profession for trying to implant human babies with artificial intelligence. Around that time, the Noelites came to me to create smarter, stronger, healthier human beings. So I built a super computer to be Aurora's artificial mother. As a fetus, Aurora learned to process information just like a computer. But when she was born she became much more than just an experiment. She became. She became my daughter. She was beautiful. She was unique. I couldn't give her away, so that's when they hired Gorsky to kill me and, well, he almost succeeded. He took my baby away and hid her for the Noelites. I searched for her, but I couldn't find her. I knew that one day the Noelites would present their miracle to the rest of the world. - What do you want from me? - I want you to find my daughter. We think she's alive and that she's left you a message. You died with your eyes open but your brain recorded more than you can actually remember. We just need to rewind the tape. You need to return to the same condition you were in when we found you. I was dead. Quite. What am I looking for? What you missed the first time. We'll guide your memory with our computer. Are you ready, Mr. Toorop? Stay with the memory. Stay with the memory. Move forward a bit. Focus on his memories of Aurora. He's seeing her. Very good. Stop! I'll die. That's right. We're getting there. We're getting there. Now is good. Focus on his gun. Easy, easy. Steady, steady. - Way past the danger threshold. - I know, but he'll be fine. He'll be fine. Hey, slow down. Slow down. Now. Slow down. Let's wait, let's wait, let's wait. I need you to live. He's dead. Wait. Don't bring him back yet. He's almost there. The last seconds. Go home. It's all right. You're back. You're safe. You're all right. You're fine. I know where she is. Mr. Gorsky, I hoped I wouldn't have to see you again. <i>Where is my money?</i> <i>You haven't paid me.</i> You have an odd way of killing people. What are you talking about? I'm on my way to see our old friend, Darquandier. Impossible. I made his car explode myself. Mr. Gorsky, when I kill, I kill for good. - Are you threatening me? - Bless your soul. You will need a nuke to kill me. Bitch. How did she survive the blast? It's the babies, you see. They're gaining power. They're the ones guiding her. Her capacity for survival is greater than anything we could ever have imagined. Professor, your wife has found us. She'll be here in two minutes. Find her, Toorop. You're the only one who can save her now. So where are we going? North. Hello, my dear. It's lovely to see you. - Where's my daughter? - I see you haven't found her. And you never will. You selfish bastard. Twenty years ago, I gave you the opportunity you wanted. Now it's my moment. Where is my daughter? She's not your daughter. She comes from me. - I designed her. - For me. She's my miracle. - She belongs to my church. - Your church is a lie. You're peddling miracles for your own profit. Are you willing to die for her? Yes. Find Toorop. He knows where she is. Wait here. You're finally home. What's left of it. But I came back for you. Have a little faith. Toorop, they're coming. Break left. Toorop, they need help. No! Take the wheel. Toorop. Thank you. For protecting us. You're their father now. Aurora. That's the first time you've said my name. You're gonna be okay. Take care of them, Toorop. Hey, kids. There's a storm coming. We need to go. Ready? Okay, Dad. Subtitles by LeapinLar - Target four. Wanna take the other truck? - Roger. - move by the truck. Move in right there. Roger. He's wounded. Hit him. Start hitting the truck. Get the truck and him. Go forward of it and hit him. Roger. Go ahead and store that. Another guy moving right through. Good. Fire. Hit him. Get down on the floor. I said, down. Down. You. Down. Now. Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Get the hands over your head. Over your head! Get down. On your knees. There. Stay there. Get your hands up. Get your hands up. Get down. Shit, there's a kid in there. That's not our problem. None of this is our problem. Get your hands in the air. Hey. How's it going, little man? You all right? I was 27 years old the first time I died. I remember there was white everywhere. There was war, and I felt alive. But, really, I was dead. - So how old? - Twenty-seven. Here he is. Starks, Jack. Born in Vermont. Hasn't got a family listed. Naval hospital will take care of it. Oh, my God. - This soldier's alive. This man just blinked. - Been tagged already. - Worry about the others. - No, no, look at this. Oh, shit. Code blue, code blue. We need a doctor. Get a doctor over here now. Sergeant Starks was very lucky. A little more to the right, it wouldn't have come out. He has retrograde amnesia, acute psychological suppression. We couldn't find any family in the States, sergeant. - I'm sure you have friends. - I want the paperwork this afternoon. - Get him on the next flight out of here. - Yes, sir. He's recommended you for the Bronze Star, sergeant. - There is help for you, sergeant. - Of course there is. Of course there is. You guys all right? - Our car won't start. - That's your mom? - Yeah. - What's your mom's name? Jean. Hey, Jean. Can you hear me? Can you wake up? I need you to try and stay awake. - Oh, God. - Your mom taking anything? - What's your name? - Jackie. Nice to meet you, Jackie. Tell you what. Why don't you do this. Wrap it around yourself and you try and keep your mom awake, and I'll go work on your car. - All right? - Okay. Oh, God. No. Oh, no. What do you think of all this snow? - Nothing. - Nothing? What are these? Those are dog tags. See, they got the name and the date of birth on them. - What for? - In case I get lost or can't remember who I am. - Can I have them? - Yeah, you can have them. - Thanks. You think you can reach the ignition? Go ahead and give it a shot. Just keep turning, all right? Keep going. It works. Hey, get your fucking hands off. Get your fucking hands off my daughter. Get your fucking hands off my daughter. - Mom, he fixed our car. - Jackie, get in that car. Now. - Mom. He fixed the car. - Get in the goddamn car! - How's it going? - Pretty good, man. - Where you headed? - On up in Canada. - I can take you to the border. - That'd be great. - All right, bud, jump on in. - It's freezing. - Hey, man. - Hey. Thanks. Jump on in here. Hey, no problem. My God, it's cold. - Must've been freezing out there, boy. - Yeah. It's colder than a witch's titty with a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow. - So you drive? - Yeah, sure. All right, man, great. We'll switch up in a bit. You ever been to jail? - No, I've never been to jail. - I'll tell you what, buddy it's a whole lot goddamn worse than war. It's probably worse than anywhere you been. I doubt that. Are you kidding me? What's he pulling us over for? Recreation. Jackie and Jean are the only things you know for certain about that day? Yes. Are you aware that we have no last name, no place of residence and no record of any physical presence for these friends of yours? I'm afraid I might have to actually hear that answer, Mr. Starks. Yes. Officer Harrison had been shot three times. He was long dead by the time we got there. Jack Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well-conceived plan about the little girl and her mother. - Objection. - I have heard of Gulf War syndrome. War is just a CNN special. Half the shit that went on in Operation Desert Storm can't be tidied into a top-of-the-hour headline. Couldn't be said neatly, so couldn't be said at all. - There was someone else. - War's ugly. - And they don't put ugly on TV. - My client thinks he already died once. - I don't really remember all of it. - He doesn't know what's going on. .but there was someone else. I think that's what happened. If Starks did kill that officer can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind. We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. Jack Starks, I hereby sentence you to be committed to an institution for the criminally insane where I hope the doctors and proper treatment can help you. Come on, bud. Come on. What are you doing? Get him up. Please believe. What are you doing? I don't belong here. - I don't belong here. - No, I don't think you do either. But neither of us can do anything about that now. Please. Please. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Please. - How much did you give him? - Fifty cc's. - And he's been in for the full three hours? - Yes, sir. Okay, get him out. Jack, can you hear me? Jack, blink for me if you can. - He didn't lose consciousness. - Do you wanna put him back in? No, take him out of it. Take him upstairs and check his vitals every hour. Now that's, I think, the context in which to view what's going on. Perhaps you may have seen a lead story in The New York Times. Good morning, Dr. Lorenson. You're the cop killer, right? - That obvious, huh? - TV, you know? Helps soothe an active mind. I'm Rudy Mackenzie. Welcome. Listen, I. - I don't really feel like talking. - You know, that's a shame. I don't believe in disposable language either. You know, small talk, little talk, chitchat. Useless. The game. The game's something else, though. This here is our court. I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on. All right. What are you in here for? - I tried to kill my wife. - Don't you go to jail for that? Yeah, well, I tried, like, 30 times. I never planned on doing it, you know? It was always in the heat of the moment. And she kept threatening to have me put away until finally she did. - Thirty times might make you seem crazy. - Yeah, or just. Or just plain stupid. Because you'd think by the 20th time, I would've found an alternative method or maybe a more effective one. - Morning, gentlemen. How you doing today? For me that is a really difficult question, Dr. Lorenson because the world around me is shrinking, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are coming to see me today, and they're not bringing flowers which just makes it really difficult to get organized. And you, Mr. Starks? - I'm fine. - So you're okay? You tell me, doc. You think there's something wrong with me? You're a little underweight. Maybe I'm working it off in my dreams. Done with the small talk? Hey, it's okay. Mr. Starks, glad to see you're cooperating this time. We're here to help, Jack. We're only doing what's best for you. Hold him while I get the tranquilizer. - Get him down. Fuck the tranquilizer. - No. No, that's not necessary. Get him up. Nurse, get the jacket. The only thing your mind's missing's a conscience. Wait. Dr. Becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for? Just strap him in for now. Help. Help, please. Motherfucker. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Listen, I hate to bother you. - Then don't. But what about Starks? What about Starks? Should we be just.? Should we be trying to help him any way we can? - Yes. - Should we be leaving him in there like that? The medication I've given him is intended to adjust maybe even reset, his violent proclivities. Peel away some layers of hate. The apparatus is merely a safe place for that to happen. The grounds and the halls, where I can't monitor side effects I can't predict, aren't. But how can you be monitoring the effects while he's in there? I consider the time he's spent in there part of the treatment. You can't break something that's already broken. I don't belong here. I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe in here. I can't. I can't breathe in here. I'm gonna blow your head off. In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here. Thanks. You got somewhere you need to go? I'm not sure. Well, let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options. Have you got somewhere you need to go? Yeah, I do. Well, great. Get in. So where can I take you? I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - I don't know. Okay. Well, there must be another shelter I can call. Yeah, well, thanks a lot. Merry Christmas to you too. Great. That was our last option. What am I gonna do with you? Nothing. I'll. - Listen, thanks for bringing me this far. - Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat. - I'll manage. - No, you won't. You'll die of cold, and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. You want a drink? No, I'm okay. Shit. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You know what? It's Christmas Eve and. And I have a couch, so you can stay on it. I'm gonna go take a bath. Fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. No. I wouldn't. - My name is Jack. - No. Let's not do the name thing, because it's. I don't wanna meet you. I may wanna help you tonight, but I don't wanna know you, really. Okay. What's this? Best I could do with what was in the fridge. Thanks. No problem. - You want a drink? - Yeah, sure. It was pretty good, considering. Your fridge has quite an array of things. Not a lot of food, but. - Freezer has a rock in it. - What rock? There was a stone in it. It said "petal." That's snooping. It was my mom's senseless idea of a nickname. It's. So you're a waitress. I mean. I don't know what I mean. Okay. I hate Christmas. Hey. Hey, wake up. Jackie. - No. - Who are these people? - What? - Who are the people in this picture? That's my mom and me. - What do you mean, your mom and.? - No, wait a minute. - Where's your mother now? - My mom is dead. - What do you mean, she's dead? - I mean, she's dead. Dead. Gone. She passed out with a cigarette and burned to death a long time ago, all right? No, no, no. Listen, I'm sorry. Listen. I don't know how. - What's the date today? - What? I know this sounds crazy. What year is this? 2007. What? What? Who the hell are you? I'm Jack Starks. Get the fuck out of my house. - What'd you do, snoop all over the place? - No. God, you had no right. You had no right to go through anything. Look at me. I know this doesn't make any sense, because it doesn't make sense to me either. Oh, my God. If you don't get out now, I'm gonna call the cops. No, please. Please, wait. I won't hurt you. Just talk to me, please. l. Your mom was passed out on the side of the road when I met you. She was wasted. Jean, her name was Jean. - Just stop it! - Look, I gave this kid those dog tags. No, no. No, you didn't. Jack Starks did, and Jack Starks is dead. What? What do you mean, he's.? He's dead. His body was found New Year's Day, 1993, Alpine Grove. He's dead. - It can't be. - Well, it is. Listen, listen. I don't care who or where you think you are you're not Jack Starks. So whoever you are, I did a nice thing. I did a really nice thing, and you've really. God, you've really made me regret it, so please, please, would you.? Would you just leave? Okay? Don't you remember me? - Oh, my God. - Look at me. I'll leave, okay, I'll leave, but look at me. I'm not lying to you. I met you. I met you and your mother, and there was no one around for miles. I couldn't have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around. You put those down, and you get out. Don't you remember me? - Don't you know? I'm. - You get out! I'm. Okay? Please. Please get out. I'm gonna blow your head off! Jackie. Oh, God. I can't believe you left him in all night. You didn't say anything when I asked. I expected some common sense on your part. Open the drawer. Is he dead? No. Get him upstairs immediately. He's dehydrated. I want him on an IV by the time I get up there. I tried to tell you when I came to your office. I expected you to take him out. You're a physician. I shouldn't have to spell everything out for you. Jack? Jack? Tom. Tom, can I speak with you for a moment, please? - What have you done with Jack Starks? - What do you mean? - He's unconscious. - He's recovering from Loxadol and Ativan. Loxadol? He didn't need neuroleptics. You know that from what, a couple of two-minute stares across the room? He didn't need antipsychotics, if that's all you gave him. After he attacked me, I figured he'd need a little placating. You sure he wasn't provoked? Are you sure you wanna make an accusation like that? I'm not making any accusations. He's bruised up. Happens sometimes when you gotta restrain them. Listen to me. He is not gonna end up like Ted Casey. I don't know what you're trying to do, but he's not a lab animal. You can't reprogram them, no matter what cocktail of drugs. You really don't let up, do you? Just because you failed Ted Casey doesn't mean the rest of us did. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's Christmas, remember? Hi, how are you? Sorry I'm late. - Hi, Babak. - That's a nice wave. - Hey, Jamile. - Hey. Okay, that's great. That was the truck. Now point to the ball. Very good. Wanna hold it? Feels nice. Strong. I need you to stay with me for just a little while more, okay? We'll get there. Could I have some water? Could I have some water? I have some water? Here you go. What the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me? Just something to keep you calm. Did you just say something? I said, the drugs are to keep you calm. Did you sleep well? - I wasn't asleep, was I? - You were asleep for nearly a whole day. It's December 26th, Jack. How are you feeling? - December 26th? - That's right. - 1992? - Yes. And that's the sun, and you're on Earth. And I know you know better, Jack. Who the hell are you? My mom is dead. 2007. Jack Starks is dead. Get out of here, get out! - You left me in there. - In where? You left me in that thing. In the drawer. And then you put me in a straitjacket. We were forced to use restraints, if that's what you're referring to. - It wasn't a fucking restraint. - That's exactly what our equipment is. Relax. Don't act like I don't know what's real. You're suffering from delusions as part of your condition. No, I know what's real, I know. You strapped me into something and stuffed me in a fucking drawer. It wasn't a dream. I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I wasn't. I have to say this is the most resilient I've seen a patient undergoing this treatment. I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey. Ted sodomized a 7-year-old girl. His lawyers asked me to have a look at him because after his deeds were done he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and howled like a dog. Ted never went to prison because everyone, including me, believed he was sick. So he came here. Then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit her relative and I caught Ted stealing looks at her. The kind you really have to steal, if you know what I mean. I asked Ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he'd slain was wearing. "Oh, yes," he said. "I remember it. I remember it well." Those were actually his last words. What happened to your face? I was careless. It won't happen again. I'll say a prayer for you, Jack. Maybe God will pick up where the medicine leaves off. You sure you know where to find him? Jack. What are you doing, Jack? What are you gonna do to me? I thought I'd just ask you to come inside with me. - What if I didn't want to come? - Well, I'd probably ask you why. Because I'm not crazy. You suffer from a delusional disorder. It doesn't mean you're crazy. It just means you're confused. You're here instead of jail because your condition played a role in your crime. - I didn't kill that cop, but I don't remember. Your mind's ability to distinguish between your fantasies and the real events that happened. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up, not my mind. Jack. I'd like to ask you a question, if I may. Since when do people around here start asking for things? - Okay. Smoke? - That's what you wanna ask? No. I wanted. I wanted to ask you how your treatments with Dr. Becker are progressing. Fine. Fine. I hope you'd tell me if that wasn't the case. Why? Why, what would you do? What would you do? I would try to make it stop. - I'm not sure I want him to stop. - So it's helping? They're making me feel like a different person. You coming? We're gonna freeze out here, you and I. Could get hurt if they catch you trying to leave again. What do you know about the shit they do to us in the basement? What shit? - You know what I'm talking about. - No, I don't. Yeah, you do. That jacket. - What jacket? - The fucking drawer. Now, stop playing games, you know what I'm talking about. I know that they take you down there. I know that they put you in it. The rest of it, it's. It's a trip, you know, it's like a serious vacation. I found out I'm gonna die. Well, mortality is actually a great thing to be familiar with. I'm gonna die in four days. That's what I found out. They find my body in four days. What are you two yapping about? We're talking about our ability to go forward in time to go into the future. I mean, that's what we're talking about, right? Yeah, that's right. If you need to find something out when you're in there, just calm down. The less you freak, the less you'll trip out. Yeah, but all this shit from before just comes tumbling. Yeah, but that shit is in the past. Focus on what you need to get now. - I gotta get back in there. - That could be a problem. - Why? - Lorenson's got her claws into it now. When she started getting suspicious of me was when they stopped putting me in there. Women. What do you think I should do? You could still give Becker an itch. You might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me, you're saying that's about to happen anyway. Oh, man. Please continue, Mr. Mackenzie. Okay. Well, I've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization. And what have they approached you about, Mr. Mackenzie? And this is nuts, but they have asked me to head up the Organization for the Organized. - The Organization for the Organized? - Yeah, you've heard of them? No, Mr. Mackenzie, I have not. That's because there is no such organization, you idiot. That is categorically not true. That is blatantly and manifestly not true. They have asked me to lead them. And if you'd heard of them, then they wouldn't be hush-hush, would they? What do the rest of you think? Well I know they exist. - And how is that? When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized. - Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? - It is a fact. Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr. Mackenzie. It is a fact. Bona fide and classified. I knew it. I knew it. You know, those little fuckers are everywhere. They only recruit the best, Mackenzie. - Calm down, Mr. Starks. - Stay calm, see, stay calm. Always ordering us to stay calm, be calm. Be calm. Be calm. They order you to order me to be calm. How are we supposed to be calm? Look at this place. So, people, wake up, okay? Orders come from the top only. Don't let them order you around. Long live the Organization. Long live the Organization for the Organized. - Sit down, Mr. Starks. - No, no, no, you've gotta listen. Long live the Organization for the Organized. Join the Organization. The Organization needs you. - Fight the good fight. - You listen to him. - You don't listen to me? - Sit down. You gotta listen to him. - Long live the Organization. - Sit down. Join the Organization. You gotta listen to him. Oh, Starks you are real stubborn. But there's ways of fixing that. The less you freak, the less you'll trip out. Stay calm. Criminally insane. Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car with your hands in the air, please. - What seems to be the problem, officer? Problem is you're moving too slow. Step out of the car with your hands in the air. Can I open the door here? Hey, soldier boy, you awake? Didn't think so. Yeah. It's okay. You're okay. Hey, Jack, grab the ball. Show Mom, honey. Will you give me one sec? You got nerve showing up like this. You mind? Okay, here goes. Jack Starks died from a wound to the head, January 1 st, 1993. How? I mean, how do I die? It didn't say. Does that mean you believe me? I don't know what I believe. - What else you find out? - Whole bunch of stuff. There was a doctor. Becker. He was using some kind of behavior modification on his patients that was banned in the '70s. And there was another doctor too, a Dr. Lorenson. And something about a kid she was treating. Babak. - Don't know who that is. - I don't know but the whole thing was a major scandal. Becker claimed he was trying to create a womb-like environment for his patients. Fucking womb. It wasn't a fucking womb. Look, I have to find out how I die. Well, Alpine Grove still exists. We could go see if there's anyone around who might know what really happened. We could. Thanks for doing this. Well, I must be the crazy one, right? I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your uncle's death. They used the hospital medical examiner. - "Blunt trauma" doesn't tell me anything. - I'm sorry, that's all it says. I mean, weren't there doctors? What about Dr. Becker or Dr. Lorenson.? Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. She was here the same time as your uncle. I'm sure she could be of more help to you. - And what about Becker and Hopkins? - Dr. Hopkins died. And I'm not familiar with a Dr. Becker. Well, can you see if there'd be any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker? Is there some particular reason for these questions? He's the only family I remember. What does this guy keep smiling about? Hi. Beth Lorenson. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. - Hi. Beth Lorenson. - Jackie Price. Sit down, sit down. I'm sorry. You look exactly like him. Did you know him well? Your uncle was my most memorable patient. - Why is that? - In the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things. - He actually helped me with a case of mine. - Really? What case? - I was working with a little boy. - Babak Yazdi? - Yes. - Who was he? A friend's son. How do you know about him? We saw it when we were looking up information about his uncle. How did he help? Well, it's complicated, but in the end he let me know how I could get through to him. - How? It's complicated. And it was a really long time ago. Let me ask you something. Do you know how my uncle died? Yeah, I think it was from a head trauma. Yes, but how? How did he get it? I don't know. You don't? Think Dr. Becker might have a better idea? Yes, Dr. Becker would know more. - I don't believe a word she just said. - Me neither. Come on. There's one last thing. - to remind you of the staff softball game at 4 p.m., so don't be late. Jack, what is this? This is the room. They used to hang it over there. I'm actually in this drawer right now. You know what? Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. You folks ain't supposed to be down here. We were just leaving. Do I know you from somewhere? I don't know, do you? I don't know, you probably know my uncle, Jack Starks? Goddamn, that's right. - You're his spitting image. - Yeah, I know. - You could be his ghost. - Could be. - You remember him? - Oh, yeah, sure. He was a great guy. You wouldn't happen to know how he died, now, would you? I just remember them finding his body. Is that all you remember, Damon? How do you know my name? - I know all about you, Damon. - Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. - I know you're a piece of shit. - I don't like you getting in my face. - Was it you? - Don't know what you're talking about. - He was hit in the head. Sounds like you. - I never touched him, man, I swear. What's going on? - See you, pal. - This is a restricted area. Damon. Damon, Damon, they're gone. It's time for your medication. I'll see if I can track Becker down. How long do we have? I don't know. I don't think we have that much time. Come on. Well then you get yourself to me tomorrow. You don't and I'll take it personally. Oh, yeah? Do you want a drink? I'm running out of time. I don't care. You have to come back. I didn't ask for you, but now you just have to come back. It's not like that. I don't have control over it. Well get control. Come back to me, Jack. I can't help you unless you let me. - That thing is my only chance in this place. - What thing? You don't understand. Well, try and help me understand. I've. I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in there. What time is that? 2007. What year do you think it is now? - I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992. - Okay. So tell me about 2007. What does it look like? - Doesn't look that different. - The future doesn't look different? No. Not to people like me. You think you're traveling in time? - Is that it? - Listen. - Not everyone in this place is crazy. - Like who? Like Mackenzie, maybe? Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife? Mackenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself before he was brought here. All because his wife left him for another man. I don't care. Look, I don't have time for this. I gotta get out of here. These are all facets of your delusions. Oh, yeah? What about Babak? Is that a facet? How do you know about him? You told me. I saw you. You thought I knew something about him, so you told me. How do you know about him, Jack? Because you told me. You told me. I know somewhere inside of you you have to believe that what I'm saying is true. You have to. I don't know how you know about Babak but these ideas are part of your delusions. No. No. Hey. I brought you some smokes. Lorenson said that your wife left you for another man, so you lost it. How's that for a thank-you? Well? I didn't want to see it. You know? I'm in here because they say I have a nervous condition. Well, well, here's my question: Who wouldn't be nervous if they really, really looked at their lives? I mean, whose life is that good? Rise and shine, Harold. Jamile? Have you told anybody about my sessions with Babak? - Of course not. - Has anyone been asking about him? No. I would have told you. Well, hello there. How you doing today? You ready to work? Okay. Jackie. Jackie. Hey. - Okay, this is really freaking me out. - Tell me about it. - Oh, God. You want this? - I want this. - Hey. - Hey. God, I should get the heat going. - Oh, I found out about the little boy. - Yeah? Babak? Lorenson used a mild form of electroshock therapy which disrupted his seizures. She didn't even know that's what he was having before. That's what you have to tell her about. I think Becker's house is around here somewhere. I marked it on the map. - I think this is it. - You sure? Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. All right, let's go. Hi there. You looking for Dr. Becker? There he is. How's that work, huh? God doesn't remember? Is that it? - Can I help you? - I don't know, can you? - Do I know you? - I think you do. - You're his son? - Nope. Not his son. What's the matter, doc? You look like you've seen a ghost. But how can you be.? - He died years ago in the hospital. - Yeah, you killed him. Didn't you? No, I didn't kill him. The treatment might've pushed him to kill himself. No, I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How did that happen? All I can remember from the last time we put him in there he. You came out and said their names to me. What names? People I tried to help. Who were they? Nathan Piechowski Jackson MacGregor Ted Casey. I didn't ask for them, any of you. - You were criminals sent to me. - We were patients. We were patients. You were criminals. Hold on a second. So you said I came out of that thing, and I told you those names? Well, who do you think told me about them? You did. I'm in that drawer right now. I don't understand. You're haunting yourself, old man. - I didn't put you in Alpine Grove. - No. You pumped me full of drugs and you stuffed me in a morgue drawer. With every intention of helping you. And that justifies it? We're all dead, Jack. What is it? - I have to sit down. - Is everything okay? - I have to sit down. - Jack, what is it? Jack? He's taking me out of there. - He said it was the last time. - What? - Jackie, he said it was the last time. Go. - Oh, my God. - What was your address? - What? When you were a kid, when we met what was your address? 2140 Waldemere Way. 2140. 2140. - Jackie. - Jack. Jack, stay with me. It's the last time. The last time. Jack. I saw you. I know what you did to your patients. Years from now, I saw you. You told me about Piechowski and Jackson MacGregor and Ted Casey. You told me. All those guys stay with you. All of us. We all stay with you. We haunt you, haunt you. All of us. We haunt you. We haunt you. Could l.? Could I have some paper? Paper and a pen. Need to write something. Listen, your patient, Babak is having seizures. That's why he hasn't learned to speak properly. Who told you this? Just telling you something you already know. You just haven't figured it out yet. He's not slow, he's having seizures. Electro. Electroconvulsion therapy. You used it on him. That's how you reset him. No one would ever use ECT on a child. I don't know that he is having seizures. If he is, that could send him into status. It's a permanent state of seizure. No, no. Babak is my friend's son. I would never risk that. You will. Can you just grab the end of that for me? I've. I've given him a sedative. Okay. I'm only gonna do it once. The settings are very, very low. - Are you gonna stay in the room? - Yeah. Okay, great. If you could just apply some pressure. Good. I'm just gonna press this button. I'm just gonna set it a little bit lower. Okay, now I'm at the lowest possible. Okay. Here we go. Okay. We're done, that's it. We're done. Okay, it's over. All right. He's all right. He's all right. Okay. Okay. Babak? Babak how are you doing? Can you say hi, Babak? Hi, Babak. You're okay, you're okay. What do you need me to do? I need to take this to someone. This is a secure unit. There's no way I can do that. You have to. Please. - How long do you need? - Just a couple hours. I'm gonna die tonight. It's been decided. You want me to come in with you? I'll be okay. Hey. Hey. I remember you. I remember you too. - Come in, it's cold out there. - Yeah. God. How've you been, Jackie? - Okay. - Yeah? How's your mom? Well, okay. Do you think I could talk to her? Hey, Mom. Mom? - Hey, Jean. - Hey. Do I know you? Mom, this is the guy that fixed the car. The guy you yelled at. Okay. There something you need? It's something you need. Jackie, go play in the snow. - Why? - Just do it. Okay. I don't know how to make this not sound crazy. I know it's not gonna make a lot of sense right now but. Look. Everything that I want to tell you is in this letter. And it's really. It's very important that you believe it, because. Because it just would be a shame if you didn't, you know? Okay, I'll read it. That it? Yeah, that's it. Hey. Petal it's nice. Don't stop calling her that. I think she likes it. Hey. Hey, wait. You be good, all right, Jackie? - Okay. - Okay. Jack? Jack? You okay? Stay with me. Put me in the jacket. What do you mean? You have to put me in the jacket, it's the only way. I gotta get in there. Jack? Jack, come on. I need you to help me get you inside. Okay. You ready? - All right, you got it? - I got it. - That was it. - Justin! Put me in the jacket. - What happened? - He slipped. He slipped on the ice. - Let's get him up. Watch his head. - the jacket. What are you talking about? He said we have to get him into the jacket. I know the procedure, but we can't do this to him. Do whatever you did with Becker. I was 27 years old the first time I died. I remember there was white everywhere. There was war, and I felt alive. But, really, I was dead. Sometimes I think we live through things only to be able to say that it happened. That it wasn't to someone else, it was to me. Sometimes we live to beat the odds. I'm not crazy even though they thought I was. I live in the same world as everyone else. I just saw more of it, as I'm sure you have. They'll find my body tomorrow. You can check it out if you don't believe me. I've seen life after my death and I'm telling you this because it's the only way to help you and your daughter have a better life of your own. Jean you're gonna pass out one day smoking a cigarette and burn to death. Your daughter grows up living the same sad life you're living right now. And she misses you so much. Sometimes life can only really begin with the knowledge of death. That it can all end, even when you least want it to. The important thing in life is to believe that while you're alive, it's never too late. I promise you, Jean, no matter how bad things look they look better awake than they do asleep. When you die, there's only one thing you want to happen. You wanna come back. Mommy, Daddy, is it time to get up? He can't find four of us here. Come on, go in the kitchen. Oh, boy. - Hey, you okay? - I'm fine. You have a nasty cut there. Yeah, yeah. I slipped, but I'm alive. I'm on my way to the hospital. Could I give you a ride? Yeah, I'd love that. Okay. Get in. All right. Thanks. I'm sorry, one sec. Hey. That's sweet. Have a good time, okay? Yeah, yeah. Listen, Mom, now's not actually a great time to talk. I'm on my way to work. Yeah, I'll call you later. All right. Happy New Year. - Sorry about that. - That's all right. No problem there. How you doing? Better now. How much time do we have? [ENGLISH] Sometimes, during long shifts. we'd hallucinate. Or you might get hit by a surge. end up blind. We call the factories "sleep dealers," because if you work long enough, you collapse. But sometimes, I'd forget where I was. And everything came back to me. My home. The house where I grew up. In Santa Ana del Río. Oaxaca, Mexico. My name is Memo Cruz. We need water. And Memo? Take a guess. Memo! <i>Hacking For Beginners</i> Let's go, it's getting late. I was just on my way out. To me, Santa Ana was a trap. Dry, dusty, disconnected. But my father lived in his memories of it. He owned some land. even hired local guys to help him. The king of the town. But they say he changed. when they built the dam. 35 liters. Since when? This is nuts. Hey Pop, can I ask you. why are we still here? Well, let me ask you: Is our future a thing of the past? You think it's funny? Well, yeah. That's impossible. No. We had a future. You're standing on it. When they dammed up the river. they cut off our future. You weren't even born yet. You don't know how that felt. This might not look like much - but it's ours. And you want to let it dry up and disappear? Yeah. Exactly. You think you know everything. You don't even know who you are. At least I know the world is bigger than this milpa. <i>Hey, you made it!</i> <i>Of course! Check it out-</i> <i>I got nodes.</i> <i>Oh, come on.</i> <i>Well. at first it burns.</i> <i>Like having a hot nail driven</i> <i>into your arm.</i> <i>But I'm already working</i> <i>as a bus boy in New York.</i> <i>I mean, it looks like New York.</i> <i>It might also be Los Angeles.</i> At first, all I could hear were voices from around the village.

The biggest bordertown in the world. It pulls people in like a magnet. Even today, long after the border has been closed. Wandering souls keep coming. carrying nothing but their dreams. Today I met one. I didn't think much of him. <i>Repeat the last ten seconds.</i> <i>Please tell the truth.</i> At first, I didn't think much of him. He looked. like they all do. A little lost. holding on to whatever was left behind. Trying not to look scared. Coming to Tijuana, to work in the sleep dealers. he should be. Need a coyotek? Lookin' for a node job? I'll hook you up. Need a connection? Skinny dudes like you are my speciality. Know how to drive? I'll get you a cab in London. No? What about picking oranges in Florida? Bro. Don't want to hook up with those jokers, right? I wouldn't let them lube my connectors. much less give me a node job. Cool. I understand. I've been in your place. I remember what it was like. before I got nodes. I'll hook you up. fast. and dirt cheap. What do you say? You up for it? How much? Know what? You remind me of my Uncle Tito. He crossed the border in the old days. by foot. No joke! Before nodes, that's how they used to do it. Unbelievable! Another thing about my uncle. he was a dumb ass. Just like you. Back at home, I'd heard people talking. So I knew that node workers lived far out, at the edge of the city. Excuse me. Do you know if anyone lives here? Does it look like it? Shut up, fool. Welcome. If no one's there, go for it. It's your house. <i>Good morning.</i> Good morning. <i>There's been activity in your account.</i> Display account. <i>28 clients found your story</i> <i>by searching "Santa Ana del Río."</i> <i>You had one sale - and one message.</i> I'm interested in the guy you met.

It's a miracle. I found you. What are you doing here? Looking for you. For me? Why? I was thinking about you. How'd it go last night? Great. Some guy jumped me, stole all my money. Anyway, I'll find someone else. If you want, I can help. Want to connect, baby? Wait for me over there? The Tijuana Node Bar. In the bars you could find a cheap connection. You could find almost anything. They served shots of teki to exhausted node workers. He's busy - doing a node job. You're not from here, right? I'm from far away. I came here to work. What do you do? I'm a writer. Trying to be one at least. It's pretty new to me. But I love it. letting people out there see what I see. But my story's not that interesting. Why are you here? My family had some problems. We needed money. That's why I'm here. Our turn. Hey! What's up? Careful with the injector. It says 120, but it's running at 140. Good luck, kid. Have a seat. And the coyotek? You're looking at her. You? You want a node job, right? If I do it, it'll be done right. Where did you learn to do all this? My boyfriend was a coyotek. He installed my nodes so we could connect. He taught me. Your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. The technology was more interesting than him. Take off your shirt. Give me your hand. You ticklish? A little. These nodes are the best you can get on the street. But there's still a risk. If there's a virus or a short circuit. electricity will pour into your body through the nodes. When you connect to the other side. your body hooks into a machine. It's a two-way connection. Sometimes you control the machine. And sometimes the machine controls you. Breathe in. It'll ease the pain. Finally. I could connect my nervous system. to the other system. The global economy. Near the place where I was living. on the outskirts of the city. stood the networked factories - the "sleep dealers." This is the American Dream. We give the United States what they've always wanted. all the work - without the workers. José is in a slaughterhouse in lowa. Maria is a nanny for a little girl in Washington. You three will be on a big job in San Diego. Hey kid - Plug in.

I got a job. I think it's in California. Look. Looks like you finally found a way to get out of here. What's that supposed to mean? You want me to feel worse than I already do? I'm just saying, it's what you always wanted. To get away from this place. Bro, I didn't call to fight with you. <i>Congratulations! You sent money!</i> <i>You sent $270.</i> <i>they received $180!</i> Dude, this is a lot of money. Mom won't believe it. Can you send more? Sorry I'm late. Don't worry, I just got here. Well, how did it go? I still don't know how to thank you. Photos? Take home a memory of this beautiful evening. No thanks. I think we should. I see who wears the pants here. C'mon, kid. That's it! So? You must've left two or three back home. Zero. Really? Most of the men I know want as many girlfriends as possible. I have a theory: They learn it from their fathers. Didn't yours teach you that? I don't feel like talking about my family right now. I understand. My folks think I'm nuts. Being here, trying to make it as a writer. Why? Girl's not married, living on her own, something must be wrong. Last night I conducted a follow-up interview, and. <i>Please tell the truth.</i> I'm trying to maintain my distance so that. <i>Focus on simple,</i> <i>easy to remember details.</i> The truth is. I didn't expect to feel anything. He told me. he eats every Sunday night in the central market. It reminds him of home. His eyes. This is stupid. End of transcription. Problems with the story? I wish it were a story. All I do is talk about my feelings. Well, that's how it works, right? You can't hide anything. Maybe that's the problem. I'm telling the truth to a machine - but lying to him. Wait - he doesn't know? Well, I'm sure he's happy to have someone to talk to. I feel like he needs someone. He told me his father died. This is one of my favorite places. Want to go for a swim? What are you thinking about? There was a river near my house. I used to go for water with my old man. Want to sit? Tell me about him. There's not that much to tell. Well. what did he do? Nothing too special. He grew corn and beans. He had a milpa? Yeah. I read that the beans wrap around the corn. and the two plants help each other grow, right? Yeah. What was it like to work with something so. real? I guess I never really thought about it. Lie down. Close your eyes. They need to rest. The more time I spend connected. the harder it is to see. You have long eyelashes. You'll be alright. Help me disconnect him! You OK? What happened to him? Just pick him up! Let's go! Where are we taking him? This little guy weighs a ton. Put him down for a sec. <i>Code approved. You may exit.</i> I've got it now. Back to work! You OK? You don't look so good. Are you eating well? Sure, Ma. Don't worry. Everything's great here. I don't know how we'd survive without you. No one is allowed anywhere near the dam now. We have to go into town for water. Memo. I'm scared. How could I tell her the truth? I was just figuring it out myself. My energy was being drained. sent far away. What happened to the river, was happening to me. I don't know what I'm doing. I work in a place I'll never see. I can see my family, but I can't touch them. And, well, the only place I feel. connected. is here. with you. There's something I need to tell you. I want you to know what I'm doing. Open "Home." Open "Archive." This is embarrassing. Why? Because I'm still new at this. Open "Maricela." I told you about my ex-boyfriend, right? That's him. Nice hair-do. And that's Maricela. We hooked her up. we became friends and she took me to her village. Going there felt like time travel. Like entering a totally new world. I wanted to share what I'd seen. so I uploaded the memory - and it sold. I share stories about the people I meet. That's what I wanted to tell you. She invited you to her home. and you sold the memories? Is that bad? No. It's just. weird. I guess it is a little weird. Going there - for me - was like crossing an invisible border. But. I don't know. I had to go. I hate that there's so much distance between people. The only thing nodes are good for. is to destroy that distance. to connect us. to let us see. I want you to see me. inside. Can you see? It's incredible. You've never seen it? This is where the border wall ends. I guess they built it to keep out terrorist surfers. A song for the couple? No thanks. Something for the heart? Try someone over there. Your loss. Nodes? Cables? No, really. Those guys are always here. Always the same routine. You OK? I've been thinking. about what I'm doing here. About my dad. How he died. I told her everything. What kind of a guy he was. I didn't know what to say to him. But I do know. this has to be the final memory in this series. You asked why Memo left his village. Now you know. - How's it going? - Good. Hey, Luz isn't home, but I can let you in. Go on in. <i>There's been activity in your account.</i> <i>A MIGRANT</i> <i>A RE-ENCOUNTER</i> <i>HIS EYES</i> One. <i>What do you want to do</i> <i>with memory one?</i> Play memory. At first I didn't think much of him. He seemed like all the others. I've asked many times, but he won't show me where he lives. He looked so vulnerable. <i>The client purchased a <i>follow-up to this story.</i> Play the memory. How'd you get in here? He needs someone to talk to. He told me his father died. Someone pays you to talk to me? I tried to tell you. I wanted to do something good by telling your story. You understand, right? Never, never, trust a woman with nodes. Am I right? What are you going to do? Go back to the factory. Are you crazy? I can't go home like this. with nothing. When my first wife left me. I put all of our memories on TruNode. It was the happiest day of my life. But still nobody's ever bought them! Right? <i>I want you to have this.</i> Have you ever been there? It's in Oaxaca. A tiny village. I could have stayed. It wouldn't be so bad. Single or double? For you mami, anything.

I've been following your story on TruNode. Luz's stories? Yes. I want to talk to you. When I was a kid, my dad brought me here to Tijuana. to visit my grandma. before the wall. When I was young, all I wanted was. to be a soldier, like the rest of my family. So I signed up. And a second later, I'm a pilot. And my first mission. was in Mexico. But I didn't expect. to see. I'm not going to hurt you. Stop! I want to get off! Please! Listen to me! <i>Next</i> stop is up ahead! Just listen to what I have to say. and I'll leave, OK? I was following orders. And I'm sorry. I wish I could change it but. life's not like that. And I don't know. I thought. maybe I could help. You came all the way here to tell me that? That you want to help? How? I just thought. Maybe. And? That I could do something. for you. Anything. Hi. I can't believe you're here. You don't have to say anything. I read your letter. Really, I'm sorry. Luz, I need your help. You want me to plug him in? You want me to plug him in? Yes! This is crazy. He's a killer. He's here because of you. Because of your stories. That doesn't mean we have to help him! Luz, think about it - remember what you told me about crossing to the other side? Yes. That's what he did. He crossed over. All we have to do is help him. <i>Approved for entry.</i> <i>Twelve-hour night shift.</i> Rudy? Memo told you. He told me everything. I'm sorry. It's just that. I've never met one of my readers. Let me see your arms. <i>Code approved. You may exit.</i> Over here. Come on. Almost ready? Just one more minute. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. Sometimes I'd forget where I was. And everything came back to me. Can we go a little lower? That's good. What's happening? Take it to the left! We're almost there. Water! Water! It's a miracle, Memo. You're not gonna believe it. No one knows what's happening <i>next.</i> If they'll rebuild it, or what. But people are celebrating. Hold on. I'm taking the camera outside. Can you see? So, are you coming home? So long. Heading south? He could never go home. Neither could I. But maybe there's a future for me here. On the edge of everything. A future with a past. If I connect. And fight. Subtitling: LVT - New York I forgot where I am. You're at the place where the killers meet to decide what to do with the crippled girl. Oh, that's right. That's right. Did you hear that? That's funny. That's weird. Those people look like they're clawing at themselves. Is that blood? Claire, are you seeing this? Claire. Claire? Claire? What page was I on? Page. - I need an extension over here. - Fall back. Fall back. You kidding me? Like another 20 feet. Don't touch that. That's for the drywall guys. I told you he wouldn't do it! So then the little guy says, "You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too? Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'." The big guy says, "No, man, mine says, 'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."' Christ, McKenzie fell. Medic, we have a major accident at the south side of the building. - We'll need an ambulance. <i>- Copy.</i> Jesus. Give him some room. - Hey! - Somebody fell! - Davis? - Oh, my God, he just fell! Someone fell! Over that building! Oh, my God! - Watch it. - Oh, my God! Watch it. Get out of there! - Help! - Look out! Look out! God in heaven. Look, I don't know if you guys have heard about this article in <i>The New York Times</i> about honeybees vanishing? Well, apparently, honeybees are disappearing all over the country. Tens of millions of them. Just disappearing. There's no bodies, no sign of them. They're just mysteriously gone. It's scary, huh? All right, let's hear some theories about why this might be happening. Nothing? Come on, guys. - Laura. - Disease? Right. Could be a virus or infection. But it's all over the country. It's a coordinated event in 24 states. It's a little tricky. - Pollution? - Could be. I mean, we're just pumping so much junk into the environment they're just keeling over. But there are no bodies. Keep guessing. Dylan. Global warming. Temperature goes up a fraction of a degree, makes them disoriented? Maybe. Jake? You don't have an opinion? You're not interested in what happened to the bees? You should be more interested in science, Jake. You know why? Because your face is perfect. The problem is, your face is perfect at 15. Now, if you were interested in science, you would know facts like the human nose and ears grow a fraction of an inch each year. So a perfect balance of features now might not look so perfect five years from now. They might look downright whack 10 years from now. Come on, buddy. Take an interest in science. What could be a reason the bees have vanished? An act of nature and we'll never fully understand it. Nice answer, Jake. He's right. I mean, science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but in the end, it'll be just a theory. We will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature. Jake? How much does the human nose grow each year? - Oh, man. - It's minuscule, buddy, okay? Don't worry about it. You're gonna be a heartthrob your whole life. I was just messing with you. The Dark Lord. Don't look into her eyes. Vice Principal! What can we do for you? I'm afraid I have to interrupt you for a moment, Mr. Moore. Okay, guys, calm down. I'll be right back. - What is that? - I can't believe it. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I've never seen anything like it before. - What's going on? I don't know. You excused all the teachers? The administration makes us teach with a foot of snow on the ground. What is this? - They stopped class. - Elliot! All right. There appears to be an event happening. Central Park was just hit by what seems to be a terrorist attack. Oh, no. They're not clear on the scale yet. It's some kind of airborne chemical toxin that's been released in and around the park. They said to watch for warning signs. The first stage is confused speech. The second stage is physical disorientation, loss of direction. The third stage is fatal. Central Park? That's kind of odd. I spoke with the head of schools. He said we should dismiss the students. So take your planners home so we can get back when this is over. All right? Let's do our jobs. Hey, you guys still got to work on your science projects for next week. What are the rules of scientific investigation? Identify variables. Design the experiment. Careful observation and measurement. Interpretation of experimental data. Hey, guys? Nothing. Alacrity. With alacrity, please. My mother just called my cell again. She's hysterical. Hysterical. I told her the probability of something happening in Philadelphia is very low. I mean, nobody's telling us to leave the city, right? So I threw some figures at her. It's good to be a math teacher sometimes. You know, people are comforted by percentages. Didn't work. She still wants us to get out of the city and come out to her house. But she said for you and Alma to come. Yeah, let me think about that, okay? Did you hear about New York? Are you okay? No, I mean, are you okay? Yeah, me, too. Listen, I want to talk about it more. Julian's mom offered for all of us to get out of the city and stay with her. What do you think? Yo, Chris! I'll bring Jess and Evette and I'll meet you at the station. Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting weird, just be cool, okay? What's going on? She's acting odd. Just don't worry about it, okay? Odd? Look, if she's acting like she's distant or something. What? I can't say any more. Is she leaving you? I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay? Just relax, please? Hey. I'm going to tell you something you should never tell your best friend. Why is everybody saying that? I saw her on your wedding day. Again with the wedding. What? I walked into a waiting room by mistake, and she was crying. She looked up. I saw her face. She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot. That's not who she is. She's never going to jump in when you need her, man. <i>So do federal, state and local</i> <i>officials have a plan in place</i> <i>for this type of catastrophe?</i> <i>Are they utilizing all the</i> <i>manpower or the money.</i> - Hi. - Are you packed? - Yes. - What are they saying?

She'll feel a lot safer. - Where's Alma? - Restroom. Hey, Julian! Please have your tickets out and ready, ladies and gentlemen. I bought them. It was like getting one of those Cabbage Patch Dolls when they first came out. Madhouse. How are you? - Good. You? - Good. - Okay, good. Why don't we all. - I'm really glad you chose to come. Thanks. Elliot, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Please show me your tickets, ladies and gentlemen. - You told him about our fight? - No. - Why did he say that? - He guessed. I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put my feelings out there for everyone to see. I'm not that type of person. Elliot, these are our problems. I am upset. I'm going to sit alone and cool off. By the time we get there I'll be fine. Is that okay? Fine. I'm going to get on the train. We're not gonna get to sit together anyways. Okay. Hey, babe. - Hi, Aunt Alma. - How you doing? - Hanging in there. - Me, too. - What's wrong with you? - What? You're wrong about her. She just needs time to figure it out. Come on, don't get all sensitive. - Just give her a chance. - Okay, fine. If you don't want my help. - I don't want your help! - Okay. I heard it. Jess, could you ask your dad for my ticket, please?

You've got to stop calling me. You're acting like the <i>Fatal Attraction</i> guy, here. I feel like I'm going to take a shower and see your silhouette on the shower curtain. We ate tiramisu together, that is it. I told you that would be it. You have got to chill out. What? When? In Philadelphia? - I don't know. What did you hear? - Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What's the news? Apparently Philadelphia was just attacked. - Oh, my God. Evette. - Call Mommy. Call Mommy! Honey! Honey. Yeah, yeah, where are you? What? What? I can't hear you. I said I can't hear you! Text me. Text me. I can't hear you! They think it started in Rittenhouse Square Park. Another park? - She got on a bus going to New Jersey. - I want to talk to her. I know, baby. I know. She got out. She's headed to the town of Princeton. I want to talk to her. - Do you have a phone? - No, I'm sorry. - You okay? - They say Boston got hit, too. - Where'd you hear that? - A friend from work. What about Evette? Oh, God. She made it out on a bus. What the hell is going on, Elliot? I honestly don't know. Now what? It just stopped. I don't know. - Can't go nowhere. - They're not telling us anything. - Well, until we hear from. - Sir? Train service has been discontinued. This will be the last stop for all passengers. Hey! What do you mean? Where are we? Filbert, Pennsylvania. Filbert? Does anybody know where that is? Why are you giving me one useless piece of information at a time? What's going on? Hey, why would you just stop? You can't just leave us here. Sir, we lost contact. With whom? Everyone. I'm scared. I don't like it here. I want Mom. Don't be silly. We're safe here, okay? Sorry. She whispers to us when she gets scared. We're so much the same, Jess. I don't like to show my emotions, either. She's shivering. I know. I know. She's never right without her mom. It's okay. They're not saying anything. We're stuck here. Is Jess okay? She's not talking. We're in a small town, Jess. Nothing will happen to us here. Don't know what you want? Then just have the grilled cheese plain with milk, okay? Come on, come over here. No, you know what? Why don't you stay here? Stay here, all right? You can see me from over there. What? All right, you want to come with me? You can come with me and wait in line. You want to do that? Bro! Bro, I got it. Go get the milk. All right, yeah. Okay. You know that everyone gives off energy, right? It's scientifically proven. They got these cameras that can record what color you are when you're feeling different things. People that are angry give off a different color than people that are sad. See this ring? This ring can supposedly tell you what you're feeling. Let's see what you're feeling right now. Yellow! That's cool. That means you're about to laugh. I'm not making it up. That's what yellow means. You must be about to laugh or something. It's probably just about to come out. We'll wait. We got all day. Oh, my God. There it is! Cool. That ring really works. That's amazing. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Look at this. My sister sent it to me. It was taken an hour ago at the Philadelphia Zoo. Mother of God, what kind of terrorists are these? They're not sure it's terrorists now. <i>Moments ago, in an official statement,</i> <i>the government moved away</i> <i>from its initial position</i> <i>that this was a terrorist attack.</i> <i>Authorities are now feeling,</i> <i>by the sheer number</i> <i>of incidents being reported,</i> <i>that a terrorist group being responsible</i> <i>is becoming less and less likely.</i> <i>The event appears to be</i> <i>limited to the Northeast,</i> <i>where smaller and smaller towns</i> <i>are being attacked.</i> Where are we? <i>The infected area now</i> <i>includes most of New England,</i> <i>from Massachusetts to Maryland.</i> We're dead center. Everything okay? If we stay here, we are gonna die here. Whatever this is, it looks like it's not occurring about 90 miles from here. Let's go. Anyone got a car? Can anyone give us a ride? Hey! Excuse me, sir? Sir, could we get a ride, please? We don't have any transportation. We're stuck here. Sir, did you hear what I said? We don't have any transportation! - We have a little girl with us. Please. - Drive. Just roll up the window. Sir! You're not just going to. Can you believe how crappy people are? There's a car. Hi. I run a plant nursery up the street. We're picking up a few things from home, then heading wherever this isn't happening. We have room. - We have two others. - That's okay. Julian! Is Julian okay? We got a ride. He can fit all of us. Elliot, I can't get Evette on the phone or e-mail or nothing. - How long? - It's been about two hours. She was on that bus headed to Princeton. There's a car over there headed to pick up friends and family, they said they could squeeze one more. We got to go. Look, think real carefully about this. She was looking for a birthday present for Jess. Some kind of dollhouse. That's why she wasn't with us. I'm just gonna go get her and I want to bring her back, and then I'm gonna find you guys. I just. I need you to take Jess, okay? She's gonna be a lot safer with you. Don't do this to me. I'm doing my best here not to fall down. I'm sure the probability of Princeton not being hit is good. Yeah. You want me to throw some figures and percentages at you so we both feel better? - Please. - All right. 62% chance. 62% chance it hasn't even been hit. - Well, you go get her, Jules, okay? - Of course, man, of course. Come on. This is all some weird event, that's all. We're all gonna be fine. I'm gonna find you guys real soon. I have to go. I got her, Julian. Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it. I'm going to go get Mommy. Hold our picture. Take a look around. We'll be ready in a jiffy. We're packing hot dogs for the road. You know, hot dogs get a bad rap. They've got a cool shape, they've got protein. You like hot dogs, right? By the way, I think I know what's causing this. - You do? - It's the plants. They can release chemicals. You like hot dogs, don't you? Okay, babies, we are gonna be going, but we will be back soon, okay? Oh, plants react to human stimulus. They've proved it in tests. Did you get the mustard? Don't look outside. Stop it! Stop it! Just look at me! Just keep looking at me! Close the vents. I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay? And you're gonna tell me the answer. What? How much would you have if I said I would pay you a penny on the first day and then two pennies on the second, and then four pennies on the third day and I just kept doubling it and I did this for a month? How much money would you have at the end of the month? - Ten dollars. - No, higher. Higher, higher. Just keep looking at me. Just keep looking at me. Twenty dollars? No, keep going. Keep going. Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30. I'm gonna tell you the answer. It's over $10 million. You'd have over $10 million at the end of the month. You want to hear another one? <i>Water contamination has surfaced</i> <i>as one of the many theories</i> <i>being taken seriously as to the cause</i> <i>of the events in the Northeast.</i> We have to go through this little community of homes. Small town called Holcomb, then we hit the highway. From there, we're 30 miles from the state line. Are those dead animals up ahead? Stop the car. - You don't think it's. - I don't know. You got binoculars in the back, from when you were spying on our neighbors. Can I have the map? Elliot. Don't cause a panic, okay? Jess can hear you. It's bodies, isn't it? I knew it would be bodies. How could it not be bodies? Please, give me the map. Well, we have to turn around. There's a right turn about a quarter of a mile back. We're just gonna take a different route, honey, okay? Oh, it's the Army. We're safe! My name is Private Auster. I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base, about 10 miles back. I think they've been affected by whatever's happening. I lost communication with them. When I approached the base, I saw military personnel in the barbed wire, in the fence. So I suggest no one take that road. There's a town about eight miles behind us. There were bodies on the road into town. Cheese and crackers. Well, that still leaves us two directions. Just stop! Stop the vehicle! - What's going on? - Is everyone all right? We have no communication with anybody. - I'll talk to them. - Did you see anything out of the ordinary? Hello! Please stop! Excuse me. Who's Joey? Oh, it's no one. Any luck? I can't get Julian on his cell phone. I'm sure he'll be all right. They'll be okay. Has anyone seen any other people on the roads? Maybe he's on to something. - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Why did it start in parks? It's the same story. About eight, nine miles back. They say there's a bus in a lake. Five miles back. There were dozens of bodies. Okay. Nobody's going anywhere. We're gonna stay right here for a while. There's a woman talking to her daughter. She's talking to her daughter in Princeton. Isn't that where your friend went? Come on. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. She's so scared. You just stay in that room. You don't open the door for nothing. Just keep watching out the window with the tree, baby. Someone will come and get you soon. Tell her not to go near the window with the tree. Just tell her. Baby, don't go near the window with the tree. Ask her if Princeton's been affected. Honey, someone wants to know if Princeton's had any problems. She says everyone's dead outside. You just stay in your room. Honey? Honey, you're talking funny. What's wrong with you? - What do you mean? Everyone's dead? - What? Stacy. Stacy, you're scaring me. I don't understand what you're saying. What, baby? She's just not making any sense. <i>Calculus.</i> <i>I see in calculus.</i> <i>Calculus.</i> - Stacy! <i>- Calculus.</i> Stacy! Stacy Ann! Oh, my God. - I hear wind from outside. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stacy, Stacy, Stacy. Oh, no! We're going to go back to the car, okay, Jess? If we went down that road, where would that take us? I walked down a quarter mile, it was clean. I can't tell you what's after that, but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing. - Quarter mile? - That's not enough. Hey, it's better than going back the other way. Get a battle plan. Everybody makes a clean break. Elliot's resilient, isn't he? Yeah. He never gives up. You know, plants have the ability to target specific threats. Tobacco plants, when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars. We don't know how plants attain these abilities. They just evolve very rapidly. Which species do you think is doing it if you think it's true? Plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants. Trees can communicate with bushes, bushes with grass and everything in between. The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads. That's right. Whatever's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations. So we shouldn't be on the roads, then. The terrorists, or whatever could be watching the roads. I don't have any reason to disagree right now. We are in the area of attack. If you can't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked. They're attacking populations. We need to go where there aren't that many people. Where people don't travel. Now this is Mr. Collins. He's a realtor that works in this area. If we go west, we'll hit a county called Arundell. It's not on that map. It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads. Hardly anybody lives out there. There's no significant population there. That's our safe zone. We wait it out there till it's over. Is everyone in agreement? We should go into two groups. Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars. We need to stay in groups. Stay together. We'll go soon, honey. We'll go soon. Maybe we should've waited for the rest of them, stayed in a big group, like the Private said. Your phone's out, too? What's wrong? Okay. I was going to tell you, okay? There was this guy, Joey. His name is Joey. He's at work. We went out and we had dessert. I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late. And I didn't work late. I'm feeling really guilty in case we're gonna die. I just wanted you to know that. You lied to me? - How much farther is it? - I don't know. - We need to keep going forward. - Who the hell made you boss? Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die. You follow me, you're gonna live. I'm in charge of this group! Ain't nobody else in charge of this group! My firearm is my friend! It will not leave my side! Private Auster? My firearm is my friend. Jesus. Oh, no. What, "Oh, no"? The toxin? The toxin is affecting them? Are those people killing themselves? You were with the Private. What do we do? - We need to do something! - Just let me think. - They're dying! - I need a second. They released it? We're not near the roads. We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers! I need a second, okay. Just give me a second! We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something! - We're not assholes! - Just a second! There were children in that group! - Elliot, please tell us what to do. - I need a second, okay! Why can't anybody give me a goddamn second? All right, be scientific, douchebag. Identify the variables. That's the two groups. Design an experiment. That's what we're in. Careful observation and measurements. That's what I'm trying to do. Interpret the experimental data. Interpret. What if it is the plants? Their group was larger than ours. This thing has been escalating all day. Smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off. They react to human stimulus. Maybe people are setting off the plants? What are you saying? That guy was crazy. We have to save them. They're already dead. What if they're targeting us as threats? This part of the field may not have been set off. Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there's too many of us together. Let's just stay ahead of the wind. Let's just break up into groups. Come on! Come on! This way! Come on, follow me! I'm right here! Keep going! I'm right behind you! Here it comes! Don't you let go of my hand. Nothing happened. It's the size of the groups, I think. Could this really be happening? What are your names? - Jared. - Josh. Wait, wait! I'm going to go see if that truck has a map. You guys wait here. <i>Why aren't they looking</i> <i>into nuclear power plants?</i> <i>There are 15 or more</i> <i>in the Northeast alone.</i> <i>More than anywhere else</i> <i>in the United States.</i> <i>There's probably been</i> <i>some leak or something.</i> <i>It's probably poisoning the air.</i> There's a house over there! Come on! It could have been some terrorist booby-trap, someone stepped on it out in the field. Yeah, in a field in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania. I don't know. Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air. They're only potent in a certain density. The source had to be close to that field, if not in the field. Here's one. Plants have the chemistry to do this. They release co-transporters into the air. You think it could be plants? I don't know. But if it is, and people are setting it off in groups, we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe. We can't walk to the borders where this isn't happening, Alma. It's too far. Whatever it is, terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants, it's probably safe to get away from people right now. That must be Arundell. It's 10 miles from here. Okay, this place must have a bathroom. I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave. Hurry. Hello? My name is Elliot Moore. I'm just going to talk in a very positive manner. Giving off good vibes. We're just here to use the bathroom and then we're just gonna leave. I hope that's okay. Plastic. I'm talking to a plastic plant. I'm still doing it. You guys ready to leave? These people must have left in a hurry. I mean, leaving the front door unlocked? Hey, everything's fake. Why is this happening? I don't know for sure, Josh. But I read this article about the coast of Australia. It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria. It hadn't been around for billions of years, it just appeared in the water. It's toxic to humans, fishermen who come in contact with it are dying. It feels kind of similar to that. With the bees disappearing, I mean, I don't know, it feels like a pattern. The nature of events like the one in Australia is that they crest and then stop. We just have to be alive when it's over. I don't believe it's nature. It may not be. There could be some other explanation. I don't know. Let's go. There are people coming! We can't stay here. It's close to the roads. More and more people will come here. There's two groups coming together. There's too many of them together. Run. Run. - Is she your kid? - No. - You got kids? - No. How come? You got a problem? No. She wanted to wait. Really? For what? Me to grow up. Why are we talking about this? Sweet. I used to love those. Can I see it? You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship. - That'll make a difference. - Okay. Thank you. Hey, that's not a toy. It's got meaning to me. - Elliot! Look! - Come on. Oh, wow. <i>. is an emergency broadcast.</i> <i>All those who are still inside</i> <i>the affected area of the Northeast</i> <i>are asked to proceed to the police</i> <i>borders west of your state.</i>
