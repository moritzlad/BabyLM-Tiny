20-odd years ago, Napoleon returns from exile in Elba, puts together an army and moves east, swiftly, before an alliance of nations can occur. Wellington, with fewer men, fewer armaments, stays one step ahead of the French, teasing them with his presence, <i>knoing that a large army</i> <i>ill have to splinter to keep up.</i> <i>He moves and aits</i>. <i>moves and aits</i> <i>for Napoleon to make a mistake</i>. <i>to fall into a scenario</i> <i>that condemns him to defeat.</i> Wellington chooses the setting for victory before it exists for him, before he lays eyes on it. <i>It has an open battleground</i>. <i>a sloping plain</i>. <i>cover for encampment</i>. <i>and an opportunity to flank the enemy.</i> The Mexican army is splintered, and though they do not know it, Santa Anna's troops subsist on gasps of air and sips of hope. l share Wellington's battleground vision, though l do not know the name of the place that l imagine. l, sir, do not consider myself Wellington. Santa Anna, however, does consider himself to be the Napoleon of the West. We shall move and wait until he makes a mistake and presents us with his own Waterloo. <i>(distant shouting of orders in Spanish)</i> Stay back, everybody. Stay back. <i>(Seguin)</i> Bring him here. Water! <i>Tranquilo. Tranquilo.</i> Water! <i>Escucha. Escucha.</i> Deaf captured a Mexican courier. His letters tell us that Santa Anna's nearby and separated from the rest of his army. <i>General.</i> <i>(faint voices)</i> Left! Left, march! Attention! Back to back.

She's almost seven now. Don't smoke in here. The child is sick. I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday, and you undo everything. How am I to make it clear to you that Sophia might one day become a queen? I don't want to be a queen, Mother. I want to be a toe dancer. Be quiet, Sophia. You're going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it. Stick out your tongue, Your Highness, and say ''ahh.'' Not as bad as I thought. We'll build her a nice harness, and she'll have to wear it for about a year. Put those toys away. I don't want to see them again! You'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman. I must be off on one of my operations. Don't let them frighten you, darling. ''A nice harness''! What is he, a horse doctor? You flatter him. Our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe. - He's the public hangman. - Hangman? What's a hangman? Can I become a hangman someday? A hangman is an executioner, the man who takes heads off skilfully. Sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles. I was about to read to you. of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible, and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen. Stop walking, August. You make me nervous. Your Highness, a letter from the king. Your father wishes to see you at once. Sit down, my child. We have been honoured with a communication from His Majesty. which concerns you principally. ''We, by Divine Grace Frederick, king of Prussia, ''have, after a series of negotiations, ''decided to honour your family by selecting your daughter, ''Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia. ''and there to become the bride of His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich, ''grandson of Peter the Great, nephew of Her Imperial Majesty, ''and heir presumptive to the throne. ''Within the week, an emissary will arrive. ''to escort your daughter and her mother, ''Princess Johanna Elizabeth, to the court at Moscow. '' Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully. ''the advice of Her Majesty's ambassador. ''and extend to her, as well as to your entire family, my fond greetings and affections. Fredericus Rex.'' Grand duchess of Russia! Not bad for this family. I wonder what he looks like. That unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here. Come, August, we shall reply to the king at once. One must strike while the iron's hot. Come with me. This is the countess Cecilia, a cousin on my mother's side. and this is her sister, Maria, and this-- Your Highness may now come down. This is Count Alexei, field marshal of the Russian Army, grand master of the hunt, lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary. from Her Divine Majesty, Elizabeth of Russia. This is my daughter Sophia. Although for a long time we've heard about your beauty, Your Highness, I must confess, I was not quite prepared to see such a vision of loveliness. Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness. Come here. This pipe is for you, Prince August. These sables are to keep your shoulders warm. These gloves are to keep your hands warm. This robe is to keep your feet warm. These hot-water bottles, to keep Mother warm. Is it then still so cold in Russia, Your Excellency? Indeed, Your Highness, the rivers are still frozen, and will be until some time after we've arrived. Her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem. Convey to her my profoundest thanks. Isn't Her Majesty beautiful! How long will the journey take? If weather permits, we should reach Moscow in seven weeks, where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us. - And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun? - The day after tomorrow, unless it is the desire of this charming young lady. to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom. - Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke? - I'm sorry, I did not. - Would you like him to be handsome? - Isn't he? Would you like him to be better looking than all men, tall and gracious? - Yes, I think I would. - Well, he is all that and more. He's the handsomest man in the Russian court, tall and formed like a Greek god, a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow. - Are you eager to see him? - Yes. His eyes are like the blue sky, his hair the colour of ebony. He is stronger than a team of oxen, and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms. And he can also read and write. So can my daughter. She can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to. - Can't you, Sophia? - But I don't like to make my own bed, Mother. - Don't speak unless you're questioned. - You did question me, Mother. Say good night, and go back to your room and go to sleep. This is unexpected. Your daughter is extremely charming. and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty's court. I'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head. She's been brought up carefully, is unspoilt, and I've taught her not to flirt. You're going on a far journey, and I may never see you again. Remember what I've taught you. Always to be honest and truthful, to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country. Be kind to those who are in your service. and obedient to your husband and superiors, and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny. Another day like this, and I'll fall apart. When I return, I'll complain to the king about the state of his roads. The roads are bad, aren't they? When we reach the border, there will be snow and we shall change to sleds. Your rooms are ready, Your Royal Highness. Can I show them to you? Yes, you may. I'm prepared for the worst. Is the journey proving too much for you too? Oh, no. It could go on forever. if Mother didn't mind. Be careful with that knife. You'll cut your beautiful hand. Your hand is beautiful, isn't it? - Why did you do that? - Because I've fallen in love with you. Now you may punish me for my effrontery. I deserve punishment far more than you do. We must never do this again. It's disloyal to my future husband. Disloyal? It's treason, and I must be careful in the future, but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes. I told you not to look at me. What are you two doing? Don't answer me. I don't want to know. Sophia, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You will instantly follow me to our rooms. Incidentally, our rooms are beneath all contempt, Your Excellency. The stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us. I'm sorry, Your Highness. If you prefer the stables, I'm certain I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom. Barbarian! You're going to sleep in my room tonight. It is cold. At least you have something to warm you when you get to Moscow, That is, if your husband isn't completely made of ice. A basket of fruit with Her Majesty's compliments, and these flowers from the grand duke, who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time. Welcome home, Your Excellency. We've missed you. So, this is little Sophie, Sophia Frederica. Hardly a name for a future empress. - You don't like your name, do you? - I do, Your Majesty. You will be called Catherine Alexina, a good Russian name. We've arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church. - Haven't we, Simeon? - Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony. Come here. So, this is the mother. You've raised a pretty child. Your Majesty, I've come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude. for the benefactions which your bounty has heaped upon our house, and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your Majesty's realms. Tush, tush! A pretty speech. What I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do. - My own blood is no more dear to me than yours. - Is that the grand duke? This is the order of St. Catherine. May you both wear it in good health. Be careful it doesn't scratch you. Pin this on Catherine. What do you think of Catherine? I can only admire your judgment, Your Majesty. That's the chancellor. Steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year. Doctor, come here. What do you think of my taste in women? Looks healthy, doesn't she? Just what we need to breed sons for Russia. With your permission, Your Highness. - How was the journey? Comfortable? - Yes, Your Majesty. Are you happy to be here? Yes, Your Majesty. - Are you going to love your new country? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Do you promise to be a loyal subject? - Yes, Your Majesty. Don't make too many new friends, and no intrigue and gossip. I have my hands full now. Perfect, Your Majesty. She will give us no trouble. Your Highness. Someday I'll have every doctor thrown out of the country. Catherine, before you go to your rooms, is there any wish I can grant you? I would like to see the grand duke. His Imperial Highness, Grand Duke Peter. That's a fine way to receive your bride! I suppose you had more important things to do. I told you to be on time. Go on, kiss each other. Remember, Catherine, the first child must be a boy. That's why we had you brought here,. to provide Russia with an heir to the throne. A fine, bouncing, healthy heir. You understand me, Catherine? These are your ladies-in-waiting. They represent illustrious houses of our most important domains. Step forward, Natasha. She is the daughter of Prince Dolgorukij. Natasha, come here. This is your mistress of the wardrobe. She has charge of the beds and laces. I must show her my new invention. I'm in a hurry. I must witness an execution. I suggest that you wait in the next room. Perhaps I shouldn't have lied to you. Forgive me, won't you? His Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers. I hope I haven't disturbed you. That's Countess Varonsoff. She's always picking up the grand duke's soldiers, which I'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally. Don't bother. Don't bother. Go on with your work. Doesn't Sophia, I mean, Catherine, look beautiful? I always forget the new name. Just see what's being done to her hair! That's exactly what I'm looking at. How's she going to wear the head-dress? Where is the head-dress? - Where is the head-dress? - Where's the head-dress? We must make you very beautiful, Catherine, very, very beautiful. so that my nephew will fall in love with you. I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne. Remember, I want a boy, not a girl. Nothing less than a boy will do. We don't want any more women on the throne. But Your Majesty, what would we have done if you had been born a boy? I would have had less trouble in Russia if I'd been born a man instead of woman. We women are too much creatures of the heart, aren't we, Catherine? Yes, Your Majesty. ''Grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children, ''concord of soul and body. ''exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon. ''like a luxuriant vine, give them seed in number like full ears of grain. ''that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee; ''and let them behold their children's children like a newly planted olive orchard, ''round about their table that obtaining favour in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven.'' Blessed be this bed. Your Imperial Majesty, before the bridal pair retire, I wish to propose a toast. to Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess Catherine. May our new bride from far away be forever happy. and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her. and the hope this vast, imperishable empire has. for an heir to the throne. You have made me very happy today, Catherine, and I hope you will continue to make me happy. Now, I'm going to bed. I'm very tired. And I know that most of you. are-- are also very tired. May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning? Her Highness feels as well as can be expected. after her romantic marriage. And how is His Excellency? His Excellency is distressed because you've been avoiding him for an eternity. - I haven't been avoiding you. - You have. I've tried again and again to see you alone. - and you've made it impossible. - If you must know, I haven't had enough time to recover from the shock. of finding my husband a trifle different than you described him. I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign. Had I described the grand duke correctly, you might not have come here. I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth. How could I have known of such a degree of filial respect? Anyway, I would have taken no chances, because from the moment I saw you, - I wanted you to come to Russia. - Please, be careful. - My husband will be told. - Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you. He does. I'll always be faithful to him. Those ideas are old-fashioned. This is the eighteenth century. But I'm not a Russian. I'm going now. I told you I wanted to see you alone. I won't wait any longer. I'll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride. Maybe I won't care to ride anymore. - I'll be there, and you'd better be there too. - I will not! Furthermore, I'm going to tell my mother all about you. One moment more, Your Imperial Highness. On the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond. Don't lose the diamond. What are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost? - I hate my wife. - You hate your wife? You've only been married for a week. Why? You'll make a fine emperor someday, you idiot! You can't force a woman to be sweet to you. She's only a child! Be patient with her. You know our people are waiting for you to raise a family. - They don't care whether you like her. - I don't want her. I picked her for your wife, and your wife she will remain as long as I live. Get that into your skull. I don't want to hear any more about it. Do you understand me? Her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber. - War with Finland? - Yes, Your Excellency. - How is Her Majesty? - The last few days she's turned sour, like milk that's been standing too long. Your Highness is so happy this morning. - You can't be going to see your husband. - Dear me, my husband! I'd forgotten I have a husband. No, I'm not going to see my husband. If Your Highness were not so new to our court, I'd suspect you were going to see your lover. Lover? And what may a lover be? A lover's a man, not a husband, who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return. But, Marie, that's wicked. Don't tell me that you have a lover! I wish I had. Here, everyone has a lover, everyone but me. Oh, Marie, not everyone. Her Exalted Majesty can't possibly have a lover. What about the young man who's always with her? Why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily? Because she's weak in the knees? Oh, how shocking! If anyone should hear us! Go on, get my dress. Your highness won't tell anyone. The empress is a devil when she's angry. Of course I won't tell anyone, nor do I believe such nonsense. Neither have I a lover. I'm happy because I'm going to see my mother. - Your mother? I thought you knew. - Knew what? Your mother left for Germany. Her carriage set out at midnight. - You must be joking. - I'm not joking. Her Majesty ordered her to return immediately. But she didn't say good-bye. That's not possible. Her Majesty's in council. No one's allowed to enter. No order in this palace is intended for me. Why did you send my mother away? What wrong had she done? I don't remember sending for you. I want to know why you sent my mother away. You presume to question me? Who do you think you are, bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire? You want to know why I sent your mother away. Well, I'll tell you why. I sent your mother away because she didn't bring you up properly. I was told you were an obedient, respectful child. You're nothing of the sort! Why do you think I had you brought from Germany? To give you these pearls? Or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire? I had you brought here to be an obedient wife. and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne. Take Her Imperial Highness, the grand duchess, and turn her over to my mistress of the robes. with instructions that from this minute on she's to be attached to my personal staff. where I can keep her under my eye, where I can educate her and teach her. what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband. like a Russian wife! Now, get out, both of you. I have a war on my hands. Looking for someone? Oh, you frightened me. I've only a minute. I ran away. I came down to tell you not to wait. I must go now. Is that all you came to tell me? What else is there to tell? If you come closer, I'll scream. It will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth. Get up! Get up! Why are there six places? What's the occasion? You asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives. Tell them to come for breakfast. I never did like these diplomatic functions. - They lead to nothing. - I quite agree, Your Majesty. Don't any of you think I'm going to eat with a lot of dried-up mummies every night. Boris, sit down there. Alexander, sit over there. You, sit there. Michael! - Your Majesty. - Catherine. Take his toys. Michael, sit there. Paul! - Your Majesty. - Oh, go on. Sit down. Now, the rest of you get out. Get out! Get out! - The pig, Your Majesty. - Put it down and don't make so much fuss about it. The way you handle that pig, you'd think it was the only one in Russia. - The wine, Your Majesty. - Fill the glasses and get out. What are you pouting for? You're not jealous of Paul, are you? He isn't jealous of you. You look exhausted, Paul. What's the matter? I'm tired. My wife gave birth to a child yesterday. - Boy or girl? - A boy, beloved empress. What the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess. Remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow. Those of you who have boys, raise your hands. Exactly what I thought! A few more like you, and Russia need never worry about her enemies. What's this, Alexei? Sending notes to the grand duchess? Do you want me to send you into exile? Or shall I tell the grand duchess that you're a notorious heartbreaker. and have broken every woman's heart in this court, including mine? You're very flattering, Imperial Majesty, but the note contains nothing of importance. Then suppose you read it. ''We are all very much disturbed over your conduct. and wish you would change your behaviour so that Her Majesty might forgive you.'' Who else can read here? You read it, Catherine. I know you can read. because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books! ''We are all very much upset at, uh, uh -- ''at-- and hope. you will behave better. so that you may be forgiven by the empress.'' Send for the chancellor! - Your Imperial Majesty? - Read this for me. ''You must help me to see you alone again. ''You are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you. for a few precious seconds are in vain.'' So, you're up to your old tricks again! Right under my nose too. Well, forget about her. she's reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first. before wasting her favours on others. Go back to your dinner. It's the first time you've been of use to me in a year. As for you, look after my friends and see that they're fed well. Did you hear what I said? Sit down, you fools, or I'll send you to Siberia. She may be a grand duchess to the rest of the world, but in here she's being taught how to be a Russian wife! Catherine, where are you? Take off my boots! Go outside and send the others away. Everybody! I want to be alone tonight. Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight. You wouldn't think that once I had skin like velvet. Empress, bah! I haven't even the power to iron out a single wrinkle. What are you looking at? That must be Peter. Go see if it is, and tell him to come here at once. Your Imperial Highness, Her Majesty wishes to see you at once. What the devil do you mean poking holes in my bedroom? I wanted to watch my wife. Watching your wife won't give you an heir to the throne. The next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation, I'll have you flogged. I'll catch my death of a draft someday! Go back to your rooms and wait for your wife. This is your fault. I had hoped by bringing you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit! Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty. I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here. Thank you. Good night. Wait a minute. Come here. How long have you been at this court picking up soldiers? Two years and a half, Your Majesty. I fail to recall your exact duties here, Countess Elizabeth. I'm in charge of entertainment for His Imperial Highness, the grand duke. Exactly how far is it to your home, Lizzie? My ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan, about two weeks' journey from Moscow. Not as far as I had hoped. His Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough. Do you understand me? I don't want to see you around again. Get out. She won't snoop around here anymore. I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here. Come here, Catherine. Sit down. Haven't you given me trouble enough? Are you going to behave like an obedient wife. or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child? I don't care what you do with me. You might change your mind about that. You're in love with His Excellency, Count Alexei, aren't you? No, Your Majesty, I'm not. I'm not. It's a good thing you're not. I wouldn't advise you to become my rival. Rival? What does Your Majesty mean? You will find out soon. In the meantime, you can blow out the candles. Before you retire. you can be of one more service. Behind my mirror, a concealed passage will lead you down. a flight of stairs to another door. behind that door you will find someone waiting to come up. I don't want him to see you, so be careful. - Good night, Your Majesty. - Good night, Catherine. And you don't need to report for duty until late tomorrow. Halt! Who goes there? - Nobody. - Just a minute, my little hen. That's not the password. You'd better think up another one. Come to the guardhouse, and we'll find out who you are. You're entirely too good-looking to be running around like this. What are you hiding back there? Take your hands off me, you insolent fool! I'm Catherine, grand duchess of Russia. Don't take advantage of me. This is my first night on duty. The grand duchess isn't permitted out at night. Tell me who you are. I told you who I am. Oh, come now. Stop joking. If you're the grand duchess, then I'm the grand duke. I wish you were! if I were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess, I wouldn't let you prowl through the night like this, like a pretty little kitten. Suppose I didn't want to tell you who I really am. What would happen? On a night like this, anything might happen. if I'm fortunate. Well, Lieutenant, you are fortunate, very. fortunate. It's ringing! Three volleys. It's a boy! Have you noticed, Your Majesty, how the imperial duckling resembles his father? Hush, hush, enough of this. Now, you keep an eye on him. I don't want anyone near him unless I know about it, not even his mother. I had enough trouble getting him. If he catches cold or sniffles just once, I'll have you hung by the ears! If he coughs, I'll have you cut in half! And if anyone touches him, I'll have you shot! Your Majesty, I beg of you not to become excited. You've been ill for weeks. This turmoil will weaken you. Don't any of you think I'll give you the pleasure of seeing me die! I'll outlive all of you, you sinister buzzards. All of you! - We've been glad with rejoicing. - Your Imperial Highness! I suppose you, too, want to congratulate me. as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia. That was my intention, Your Imperial Highness. And I bring you the felicitations of my nation. and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event. Yes, I know. Tell me about it some other time. I want to be alone, do you hear? Get out, all of you! I'm crammed up to my neck with congratulations! Get out! And if you must congratulate someone, congratulate my wife! May I speak with Her Highness? The empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness. on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia. We all hope you will recover quickly. so you may wear this jewel, which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign. of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction. Sit down, ladies. Sit down. Your Excellency, what can I do for you? Will you please ask Her Highness once more. - if she will grant me an audience? - I'm sorry, Your Excellency, we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her. Then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness. that I've been waiting for some time now to congratulate her. on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne. I'm certain that history was far from her mind at the time, Your Excellency. Her Majesty is very ill, and her days are numbered. Soon she will be no more, poor soul, and another maniac will become our emperor. It will be a bad day for Russia, and for me if I live that long. Why are you telling this to me? You know that the grand duke isn't exactly pleased with the present state of affairs. State of affairs? What affairs? I haven't had an affair for some time. I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court. or worse, as soon as he is in power. You need have no fear for me. Now that I've learned how Russia expects me to behave, I like it here. And I intend to stay. grand duke or no grand duke! We all hope you will stay, and I for one, at the risk of my neck, would like to help you. How could you be of help? I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis. I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy. Should it become unavoidable, I think I have weapons. that are far more powerful than any political machine. I'm afraid you don't know Russians, my child. That's possible, father, But I'm taking lessons as fast as I can. Right here, gentlemen. What a lovely target. You're looking quite well, Catherine, since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family. Thank you, Peter. It's nice to see you again. Come to think of it, I'd like you to meet someone. who's come for an extended visit. What are you doing here? Back to the barracks! Get out! Come along, Catherine. What do you think of this decapitation? It would be more amusing if it were real. Where's your visitor? Oh, it's Lizzie. Is she in charge of your entertainment again? What will Her Majesty say? Her Majesty doesn't know anything about it, and I wouldn't advise you to tell her. I wouldn't dream of telling the empress. She has her own system of spies. Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures, as long as you don't interfere with mine. How is Astrakhan, Lizzie? Or was it Afghanistan? If you're wise, you'll find out for yourself before it's too late! There are comfortable convents along the way. All you have to do to gain admission. is shave your head. It's good for the scalp, anyway! Entirely too many men love my hair, and I have no intention of changing my residence. - Anyway, this country will soon need a new empress. - You may as well know. Peter's going to marry me when the old bat dies. and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife! There you are, you old crow. Dead as a doornail at last. What have you got to say about it? Open your mouth if you can. In another week, it'll be full of ice. In another month, not a soul will mourn for you. In another year, you'll be forgotten. Where is all your power? It's mine now! Do you hear me? Take it away from me if you can! It's my turn now! - Who is this officer? - Orloff, Your Majesty, Captain in charge of the barracks. Your Majesty, your visit here is the greatest honour in my life. I've heard a good deal about you, Captain, from the ladies. I didn't expect to see you here, Your Excellency. Why not, Your Majesty? This is my pet regiment. You look ravishing. Now, there's another good-looking soldier. Come here, Lieutenant. What's your name? Dmitri, Your Majesty. And your duties, Dmitri? In charge of the night watch, Your Majesty. It must be cold at night. sometimes. Sometimes, Your Majesty. Anyway, I'm certain you're very efficient, Lieutenant. Is he, Captain? Tell me something about him. He's very efficient, Your Majesty. He joined our regiment from the Swedish front, where he fought bravely for about two years. He's also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border. This should have been brought to our attention. I can't understand why such a brave man hasn't been decorated. His Excellency doesn't mind. Not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me. Her Majesty will tell you tonight. if you will call on her. With pleasure, Your Majesty. For bravery in action. See that you do justice to it in future emergencies. And now, Captain, tell me something about yourself. Your Majesty, I'm distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lt. Dmitri before. With your permission, Your Majesty. Rich too? Her Majesty will see you now, Your Excellency. At last, Your Majesty, I've achieved. the enviable privilege of entering these rooms. I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before. Not since the days of Her Late Majesty, whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor. Tell the others I've retired. Send them away, and come back in here. Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight. You may retire. Tell me, Alexei, are you still fond of me? Yes, Your Majesty, I love you. But I'm completely bewildered by your attitude towards me. However, I've become accustomed to regard you. as one of those extraordinary women. who create their own laws and logic. and now I'm concerned only with your safety. Is it my safety that concerns you. or the safety of an empress? I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station. The woman you adore is quite close to you, isn't she? Catherine, I love you, worship you. I asked you here tonight because I want you to do something for me. I can trust you, can't I? We'll always be friends, won't we? Yes, Your Majesty. What is it you require? Blow out the candles. Behind the mirror, as you know, there's a flight of stairs. Down below, someone is waiting to come up. Will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully. so that he can sneak in? Her Majesty is waiting for you, Captain. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Will you deliver a message for me, Captain? I would be very glad to, sir. Tell Her Majesty that I quite understand now. No, never mind. Don't tell her anything. - She'll know. - Yes, sir. Something for the poor, Your Majesty? For the poor, Captain? Excellency? Quite a haul tonight, father. Chancellor? Elizabeth? Your Imperial Majesty, something for the poor? That was for me. Now what have you got for the poor? There are no poor in Russia! Get out! I've had enough of this sanctimonious talk. Let us drink. Why doesn't he take up his collections in church? To the most charming woman in my empire, my friend, the countess Elizabeth. Go ask Her Majesty, my wife, why she doesn't join our toast. His Majesty, the emperor of Russia, wishes me to ask. why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast. Tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight. Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight. Go tell my wife she's a fool. His Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty. that she is a fool. What is your rank, Orloff? Captain, Your Majesty. Well, you're nothing now. Now get out, both of you, and stay out! Sit down! My wife is not to leave the palace. She's under arrest until further orders. Am I the emperor of Russia, or am I not? We'll issue a proclamation that she died. and ask the people to pray for her. Hurry, Your Majesty. Everything is ready. What are you doing here? Exit Peter III. Enter Catherine II. We, soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire, do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge. and to defend with our lives, the authority of Catherine our empress, and to destroy her enemies! Your Majesty, we're sorry to trouble you, But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she? She's no longer in her rooms. You infernal blockhead! This is the last place in the world she would come to. Double the guard! Surround the palace! Find her and bring her here to me! God grant you victory, Catherine. All Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell. Why are those bells ringing? Why are those bells ringing? I don't know, Peter. How dare you address me like that! Who are you? My name is Orloff, and I'm on duty as guard. I'll have your head for this insolence! You're addressing the emperor! There is no emperor. there is only an empress. This is Johannes Gutenberg. Who invented moveable type 500 years ago and printed the first Bible. Recognised as the father of modern printing Gutenberg stands on Park Row the most famous newspaper street in the world. ..where giants of journalism mix blood and ink to make history across the front page of America. The story takes place in New York in the lusty days of the 'Golden Eighties' when Park Row was the birthplace and graveyard of great headlines. The street of America's first world-famous journalist a printer's devil who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and was one of its signers. Benjamin Franklin patron saint of Park Row. And, it is the street of Phineas Mitchell. It'll be alright, officer. The new licence will be here first thing in the morning. What've you got? Gin fizz Rainbow Egg Nog Mint Julep Tom & Jerry Tom Collins Whisky Sour. What'll you have? Beer! If you want to make such progress in our profession why don't you go work on 'The World'? Pulitzer's introducing a lot of new things. It's a fine newspaper, Mr Hudson but I'm not a journalist I'm a machinist. I'm interested in the problems of setting type by hand and how slow this is. Why, Hackett's getting his out faster than any paper in the country. Gentlemen always manage to become involved in katzenjammer over journalism. I have learned there are 4 subjects one should never argue about. Anthropology, bird-calls, romance and of course, newspapers. You have become a wonderful legend, Mr Davenport. It's tragic to remain a living legend, Mr Mergenthaler. People only respect the dead. Often I feel guilty in taking such a long time to die. But I shall not die. until I am ready to forsake Park Row which has already forsaken ME. Mitch! How about being your pleasure. Jenny.a keg-drainer. Stick of straight.schooner chaser. Mitch.you've got brains. How can a character like me get to be a character enough to be written up in your paper? The prime minister stole a photograph idea from you. Look, gentlemen, I'm serious. I can sing and dance. I got a wonderful personality. In fact I've got all the makings of a delightful character. Just because I'm not famous people think I'm a bummer. Jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. It'd push Ireland's Home-Rule off the front page. You'd be cock o' the walk! The talk of New York! That's a wonderful idea. The splash 'd be heard round the world! And I'd be happy for the fellow who jumped off Brooklyn Bridge to marry my Jenny. I'd be a widow before I got married. Don't listen to him, Steve! He's taking you serious. You know.it's only 120 little feet from the bridge to the water. Now, that isn't much of a leap but long enough to make you a celebrity. And when you open your own place. You can advertise. "The Longest Bar in the World!" Steve Brody's 120-foot bar! - See it, Steve? - Yeah.I can see it. Hogwash! Longest bar in the world! I'll have a couple of drinks and think it over. Certainly, me boy.certainly. Jenny!. A couple of 'Anniversaire'. for Mr Brody. The story really bothers you. doesn't it? Yeah. What are you going to do about it? - Write a 'hankie'? - No. Who's crying in your beer about Charlie Mott? He's dead. They've hanged the wrong person. Should've broken Hackett's neck on the gallows. Where are you going? To the cemetery. Gonna claim a body? Nope.gonna lose my job. The grave people reported that a habitu√© of this 'concert hall'. had the gall to sneak into Potters Field tonight and nail a plaque to the cross of one, Charles Mott executed by the state, for murder. I had it removed. It would have been very simple to have despatched someone here. But I personally would like to confront the man responsible.. .for this accusation against me and my newspaper. Every man's entitled to an epitaph. I nailed it to his cross. Ah.the ghoul himself! I'm a newspaperman. On what paper? Your paper. He works for 'The Star', Miss Hackett. What do you do?. Shuffle refuse behind the circulation wrap? Editorials department. What's your name? Phineas Mitchell. Phineas Mitchell? There is no Phineas Mitchell on my paper. Firing me won't help the way you've prostituted journalism. I'm not running the gallows. I'm running a newspaper. He was tried by your paper. He was tried by a jury. You sprung the trap. I simply broke the story. The story broke his neck. What was Charles Mott to you? Nothing. I just don't like trial by a newspaper I call a contemptible publication. I call it peddling papers. You'd use corpses to peddle papers, till the readers found out what a frustrated journalistic fraud you are. It's publishers like you that give anarchists the ammunition to try and stifle a free press. Mr Spiro. Yes, Miss Hackett? This.defiler of graves. Who employed him? I did! Why? He's a newspaperman. And the best! Oh, I have seen this global monument somewhere. He's Jeff Hudson.editorial. There's no Jeff Hudson on MY paper. This? I don't know him. That? Thomas Guest, cartoonist.unemployed. Mr Davenport. It displeases me to see YOU with this group. Charity, my dear, you've made of yourself a newspaper jackal. feasting at the grave of a man you helped to execute. 'The Star' reported facts. nothing else. The day 'The Star' reports facts, Judas Iscariot will be sainted. Greeley turns over in his grave every time you go to press. Another disciple of Horace Greeley! Mr Spiro.escort this wench back to her slaughterhouse. before I throw her out of here right on her front page! 'Angel Dew'.goes down like water and comes up like Nobel's dynamite. I done it! Done what? I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge! Not a single bone broken. you're a liar! I got witnesses. you over-stuffed slime-wrangler! I done it and I lived. And that's what makes you hotter than a boiled sausage in a split bowl! Jenny, honey.I'll be a celebrity tomorrow, when people read about me! And you'll be the proud girl on my arm. Alright Mitch.put it in the newspaper. put it in the newspaper! Steve Brody.proudly of The Bowery. Aristocrat of the Fourth Ward. Jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge and lives to tell about it! You should have seen me.I was standing there.looking down. Looking down at the bottom. 120 feet to death! The longest jump ever made by man. It's a long jump for nothing, Steve. I was fired from 'The Star'. You was fired? I couldn't get anything in that paper. unless I died. Alright Jeff.you put it. Look.I'm standing there, see. I was fired, too. Oh, come on. Hold your horses! Hold your horses! Ain't there a working newspaper man that stands to get to cover the greatest feat in history? It's inside I'm needing relief. And I'm not talking water! Not before your bar-tab's paid. Not before he puts a chip on the bar. He'll get sick and die! I'll stake him to a stone. You don't want me to tell 'em where you got that pretty figure tucked away, off-caucus? Would you inform on your own father? I'll tell 'em how I lace you up every morning. Alright.alright.give him a drink. I've been studying you, Jenny. How'd you like me to draw your picture? Well, I was thinking of having her picture across the bar. Are you going to draw it on the wall? On a head of beer. Hey, I'll split your mainbrace if you give my girl here that sort of talk. Remember the face on the barroom floor? I'm going to draw a face on a head of beer. 4 bits you can't! Put your chip on the bar. There's the groom. Now let me see the bride. A large schooner, Jenny. with a big head. That's fine! Nothing's to it when you know what you're doing. Perfectly easy, Jenny. You're pretty as a picture. See! The trick is. it's an indelible pencil. Take it and draw yourself a picture. What's the good of writing anything. if you haven't got a paper to put it in? You know what I'd do if I had a paper? Here we go again daydreaming at night and sober! No, Mitch.what would you do? The first thing I'd do is christen it. I'd call it 'The Globe'. I'd make it the best newspaper on Park Row. that's what I'd do. I'd give away free ice coal.summer excursions. Xmas dinners for the poor. That'd make 'em happy. It'd make news.. and news makes readers! Readers makes circulation.. and circulation makes advertising. And advertising means I'd print my paper without the support of any political machine. That's what I'd do if I had a newspaper. Would you give me a job? - What did Hackett pay you? - $18 a week. I'd double it. You'd pay me $36 a week?! Sure.if I had a newspaper. Why don't you dream up your own newspaper, Jeff? And give yourself $100 a week! Mr Mitchell. For 3 years, every night, I've been listening to what you'd do. if you had a newspaper. Don't you like it, Mr Leach? I like it very much. You're that job-printer. got a shop in 'The Times' right? 'Tribune.' I don't make up my mind quickly, Mr Mitchell. But when I do.I act. Your dream kept me awake nights. And I made my decision. You sure O'Rourke's whisky hasn't gone to your head? Like you, I never trust anything stronger than beer. If I were interviewing you, I'd have nothing so far. What are you driving at? All my life I wanted to be what you are. A newspaperman! What you can do, I can't. What you need.I've got. What I dream about.you are. I've got a good steam press. I've got a little credit for type-foundry. Got a little newsprint.got a little cash. I want to go into partnership, Mr Mitchell. You'll be editor and publisher of the newspaper. I'll be printer, and handle the business end. You'll get the heart. I've got the hands. You've got the head. I've got the press. What do you say? A paper.of my own? I'd be editor. And I do no man's bidding. You run the paper the way you want to run it, and answer to no one. Can I name it? Yes. You can name it, Mr Mitchell. Is it a deal? Yep! You've got yourself a newspaper! Jeff.you're on the staff. I promised. $36 a week! 30 what?!.15 a week! $15? You promised me $36 if you had a paper. If a paper.it was a different issue. Alright.in a week. Ever draw for a paper, Tom? - No. - You're on 'The Globe'.$15 a week. - Spent all your money yet, Mr Leach? - Getting close! You know.what I need now is a good reporter like Mr Davenport. No, Mitch. You need young blood to bring life to a newspaper just born. I could use some old blood, too. Want to have them on 'The Globe.' Steve.it's the cops! Anybody in here seen Steve Brody? He ain't here. he's down at 'Lizzy the Duck'. What do you want of him, officer? He's broken the law. He just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. Any witnesses see him jump? I saw him! We're wasting our time.let's go down the 'Lizzy the Duck'. Here you are, officer. Is this the man who jumped? I don't know what his name is. But he's the fellow which jumped. Take him away! Mitch.you're a Judas! It's me, Brody, your bosom pal. Lock him in 'The Tombs'. Fake!.You and your newspaper!. You're a snake in the grass! All you reporters are snakes in the grass! Throw the keys away! Mitch.How could you've done it? How could you 've done it to my Steve, Mitch?! This'll be Brody's story. On page one! "Bridge and safety" Steve Brody drops 120 feet to the water below! Arrested.locked in 'The Tombs'. I get the follow-up. "The Globe frees Brody from 'The Tombs'." The officer won't like this. The readers will. - 6 columns.6 pages. - We're shaving close! 4 pages.let's get 'em to the office. Look, Mr Mitchell.I got printer's ink in me, too. See! You got a chore-boy? Just Mr Angelo and me. We take care of the shop. I run the press. and he sets type. Who's Mr Angelo? This is Mr Angelo. Rusty, there's only one opening on 'The Globe'. You know the difference between a guideline, a keyline, a 4+4 and a stick o' stone? Yes Sir. No you don't.but you're gonna learn. You're printer's devil. From now on, Rusty. you're a newspaperman. Yes, Sir! Got a key, Mr Leach? Fine.we're putting 'The Globe' to bed tonight. Meet you all in the office in 5 minutes. 5 minutes, Mr Davenport. What a business! Beautiful, Mr Leach. Great place to work. Plenty of room for our hard-hitting competent staff. Rusty.get all the papers. Go and get 'The Star.' And get rid of that shoe-shine box. Well, you heard it, Mr Leach. where's all your type? It looks like we'll have to set up all our stories in a couple of inches. When that type's sorted up, we'll have enough to handle the paper. Most of our jobs have been handbills and cards. How much paper have we got? Couple of half bundles in the back. I didn't figure you'd want to go to press so soon. Paper plants are all closed now. Vol. 1, No. 1, hits the street in the morning. Say.what's a job printer like you doing with such a big press? I once tried to run a weekly. I just didn't have what it takes to put out a paper. That press came between me and my wife many a time. She finally got to get fond of it, too. Jeff. Yeah, what is it, Mitch? Your brother's a butcher over on William St. isn't he? No.my brother-in-law.why? How much butcher-paper can you get from him? Butcher paper? Yeah.we're short of newsprint. and borrow his wagon. He's a mercenary. Tell him 'The Globe' 'll take care of the bills. You don't know my brother-in-law. Here's all the cash I've got on me. Alright.everybody chip in.come on! Drive the wagon up in the alley.. that'll be our 'Circulation Department'. Give him a hand, Tom. Alright.let's all pile in and sort this type. Everybody grab a handful. Here are the papers, Mr Mitchell. Got my change? Can I help? Yep.You might as well start learning how to sort pied type now. "Pied"? It means when your type is a mixed-up mess. It'll be no time before you handle the hell-box. What's that? This is the hell-box. everything is thrown in it. It'll be your job cleaning it up. And that's why you're called a printer's devil. Because you'll be living out of the hell-box. Were you ever a printer's devil Mr Davenport? Yes, Rusty.I was an apprentice. As a matter of fact I was 2 years younger than when Horace Greeley started. He walked 11 miles to get that job. I walked 18. I was with him when he built this building. Right where you're standing. Right where your shoes are. Used to be the home of another great editor. Benjamin Franklin. That's why Ben's out there on Printing-house Square. To see that nothing ever goes wrong on Park Row. - Say, Tom. - Yes, Sir? You know what that is? A stove? It's no stove, Tom. That's your office. Now give me a drawing of Steve Brody jumping off the bridge being arrested and dragged off to 'The Tombs' by the police. Take it over to Duffy's Engraving. Get a woodcut.4 columns.wait for it, pay for it. I'll take care of you later. Mr Davenport. Write me the Brody story. "No name ranks higher than that of Steve Brody." Make him a hero.bring tears, because he was jailed. You shall have molasses in every paragraph. Mr Mergenthaler. About that machine.we'll pick it up in the morning.Have it ready, eh? Rusty.give Mr Leach a hand. Jeff. Steal everything you can. but make it fresh! Rusty.bring me that oilcan! They got a new zinc process to publish black and white drawings. Let's have it. Not for us. over at 'Life Humor' magazine. Zinc eh? So that's how they get such nice lines in Charles Dana Gibson illustrations. Gibson's getting as much as $4 to $5 a drawing. You're getting a steady $15 a week, Tom. you're better off than Gibson. There it is Mr Angelo. How's it sound? I don't know.I don't read. You what? I can't read! Mr Leach! What do you want me to do? Say that I read when I don't read? Anybody can say they can read when they don't read. But I don't say that I read when I don't read. Where did you find this Mr Angelo? He comes with the press. I'll have to set up the paper myself! He can't read. How can you have a compositor that can't read English? Now don't get excited, Mr Mitchell. - Mr Angelo. - Yes, Mr Leach. Will you please follow copy, Sir? Yes Mr Leach. It's perfect! Mr Angelo can't read or write. But he's the fastest typesetter on Park Row. Mr Angelo.Don't ever change. The day you learn how to read. you're fired! I've seen a lot of Vol-1-No.-1's This is beautiful make-up, Mitch. Greeley started with $40 credit. Bennett started in a cellar. You're in good company, Mitch. How come you never got to be an editor? Edmund Bourke.about 20 years before I was born. Stood up in parliament, and said. There were 3 estates of the realm. The peers, the bishops, the commoners. Then he looked in the reporters' gallery and said: "Yonder there sits the 4th Estate." "More important, far, than they are." Somebody's got to go out and get the news, Mitch. People like me get it. People like you see that it gets to the readers. Some men are born editors. Some are born reporters. But a fighting editor is a voice this world needs. A man with ideals. And the joy of working for an ideal is the joy of living. I know. Price.1 penny! 4 pages.not bad.not bad. Oh.Mr Bennett. Mr Greeley Mr Raymond. Dana. Pulitzer. What are Mr Dana and Mr Pulitzer doing on your walls.they're living! They're your rivals. your contemporaries. Dead or alive.they're still the best publishers on Park Row. One penny! I'm so sorry! Now tell me.what do you really think of 'The Globe'? Volume 1 Number 1. This is a stallion busting out of its stall, bristling with news! This is a newspaperman's newspaper It'll die like all the rest of them. The others weren't printed on butcher paper. I apologise for disturbing you, Miss Hackett. Now, I'm not a journalist. But this is definitely an outrage to all newspapers. I can't understand why Mr Spiro dislikes me. Oh, the entire editorial department dislikes you Mr Wiley. Because, in you they see the business executioner. My first loyalty is to you. That's why they have contempt for you. Your first loyalty should be to 'The Star'. Is this a new kind of a printing press? No.I'm trying to compose type. Type?.Type like this? Yes. You mean, you talk to this machine and you make this? Mr Angelo.today it is possible for a man to tap keys. Write what he thinks and it comes out on paper. You have heard of this machine. the typewriter. I don't know. I have watched you work. You are fine. The fastest compositor I have seen. But it takes such long time for the printer to put his text into type. I think to help progress printing, it is better if there is a machine that can do what YOU do. Faster.very much faster begging your pardon. If you can make this do what you say, you smart like Mr Gutenberg. You make this? You got 400 years on him, Mr Mergenthaler. that's quite an advantage. No man bettered Gutenberg. Many people have tried. You think he can make with that machine what he wants to make? Sure.he's a watchmaker. He has the golden touch for delicate machinery. Sometimes I don't know what he's saying. the way he speaks. What do you mean? He's not clear.he speaks with a big accent! You know what I think? If he can make that machine work the way he says. You don't need me to set type. You'll learn how to operate it. You got to know how to read, to operate it? You know as much about it as I do. Don't worry about it.. you're not getting fired. How can I be fired? I no got pay yet! You give me a job.I do it. and I pay YOU money. I don't know I like this work on a newspaper. The newsboys want to know when we're coming out again. What did you tell them? I told them we're putting 'The Globe' to bed tonight. And coming off the same time tomorrow morning. Fine! How's the bank account, Mr Leach? Or do we come out with another porterhouse edition? We'll be lucky to get enough paper together to get out a rump roast edition! Better start breaking up the pages. - Come on Mr Angelo. - Yes, Mr Leach. How's Brody? He's alright now. Jeff.get the Bowery Boys and get them over to 'The Tombs'. Get my hands on him. Rusty.get the Plug-Uglies over there. I think I have a story. Made a few notes. I'll give it to you right off the cuff. Torts.arm.what is this? Part of that statue. the gift from France. What about it? It's on display now in Madison Square. We'll go over it later. Right now I've got to write the Brody follow-up. Stir up the members of the Dead Rabbits, too. Get them over there. You'll have 3 rival gangs congregated in 'The Tombs'. Yes, Brody belongs to all of them. What's the matter? Must we have a riot, just to get a story? I didn't say I wanted a riot. Man jumps off a bridge and dies. there's nothing they can do about it. If he lives, they throw him in the clink! In this case.Brody's a hero. You can't deny that. There won't be any riot. Is this all you have? The Republican anti-saloon movement in New Jersey is spreading. Democratic majority in the House to reduce the number of employees. This is just a little party capital. during fall elections. I want something controversial. There's a rumour that 'The Globe' is getting Brody out of 'The Tombs', tonight. So?.well.we're back to Mr Mitchell again. You like him, don't you? I respect him. Brody broke the law. Take my word for it. 'The Globe' isn't strong enough to free him. Tell me something about this stallion bristling with news. Where'd he come from? Who are his parents? Is he married? Engaged? Divorced? How'd he get a start? What does he want? All I can tell you about him is that every year produces one great newspaperman. The stock isn't as good as your first issue. Wrapping paper.I made the rounds of the shoe shops. You know what's very exciting, Mr Mitchell. You came out with Brody's jump this morning. Tonight you have another edition with his release. 2 issues in the same day! Remarkable. Only page 1 has been changed, though. Once I get my hands on enough type, paper and ink. I'll come out with 2..3. maybe even 4 editions a day. Just change the front page. You know, Mr Mitchell.I've been giving you a great deal of thought. Me too.a lot of thought. Don't you like what you've been thinking about? Is that the only dress you've got? Oh, it's good makeup, Miss Hackett. nice form, nice balance. Pretty as a perfect front page. Thank you. But you remind me of the obituary column. You're always in black! The copy's in.how come you're not in bed? I couldn't sleep. I've been going over these notes you scrawled. How come you left your cuff here? Oh, I have an extra cuff. Eiffel?.Is that the same Eiffel that's building that tower in Paris? Yes. What did he have to do with the statue? He built the iron frame. de Lesseps. You've been eating at 'Dinny's Beef & Bean' again! The same de Lesseps that built the Suez Canal? Yes.he had something to do with the Suez. What's this about a subscription? The Franco-American Union raised 1 million francs. for Barthaloldi to build a monument. How much is that? $350,000 Why'd they build it? To cement the friendship of 2 great republics. France and the United States. A gift from a people to a people. Not from a government. So the people of France actually donated their own money to build the statue? That's right. What's this about a torch in Madison Square? Congress passed a resolution, accepting the statue. But declined to grant a subsidy for the necessary base. The head's at The Battery. the body's on South Street. Doesn't have a leg to stand on, has she? No, Mitch.she needs a pedestal. How much would that cost? $100,000 I am annoyed, because you gentlemen seem to lack imagination and circulation ideas. This Mitchell has run the first front page editorial cartoon to appear in newspapers. Would YOU have run a cartoon on the front page, Miss Hackett? Plaster 'The Star' with penny valentines? No thank you. I'd rather see my paper in Hades, than commit a frowsy woodcut to the pages. But at least the idea would have been born here. That's what I'm driving at. He came out with 2 editions yesterday. On butcher paper. Wrapping paper used for shoes. Heaven knows what kind of paper he'll use tomorrow. Now he's offering to publish the name of every subscriber. No matter how small or large the amount Pennies or dollars. Rich people or poor people. Mr Wiley.there's a German in this country experimenting with a machine to compose foundry type. Find him, and get him. You mean Mergenthaler? Yes, that's his name. Do you know where he is? Yes, he's working on his machine at 'The Globe'. Ottmar Mergenthaler? He's at 'The Globe'? <i>G√ºten Morgen!</i> <i>Wie geht es Ihnen?</i> <i>Herr Mergenthaler?</i> <i>Mein Name ist Fr√§ulein Hackett.</i> <i>.von 'The Star'.</i> If you don't mind, I prefer to speak English. Of course. You know, I knew a Herr Mergenthaler in W√ºrttemberg. You have been to W√ºrttemberg? That is where I am from. In Germany "Merkantaler" In America Mergenthaler. It's easier to say. I like the people there. But I don't like Stuttgart! Who likes Stuttgart?! You know there's some talk on the street about the greatest invention in printing since Gutenberg. If it works. IF it works! The whole idea is to enter the dream of all printers. A machine that will end the hard and slow work of setting type by hand. This is now my dream, too. Well i suppose you know that Mark Twain is also working on a typesetting machine. The Paige Patent. I know. I've heard Mark said it will be able to do everything except drink, smoke and go on strike. Can yours? It's so complicated, perhaps it will even talk. I shall try to follow the conversation. Perhaps you will have the answer i am looking for. I call this 'blower machine'. I call it that because the matrices up here are moved down to here. They are blown down by an air-blast, when I touch one of these keys. You mean you cast your own type, when you touch those keys? Then a bar of lead is melted so that the justifier forces hot lead against the metal. And it forms the type. The face of the type is in perspective. How long would it take you to set up a column of type? As long as takes 12.15..maybe even 20 of your printers by hand. Then it would be no trouble at all to get out more than 1 issue a day? Nothing. With 10, 20 maybe 40 of these machines. I could have a circulation of a million daily. maybe 2 million. The big problem now is to separate the paper from the metal. It sticks together and the type is not clear. Oh..we must solve that problem! I'm going to help you all I can, Mr Mergenthaler. I've a great newspaper. And once we baptise this new machine, we'll make newspaper history. I have a lot of room for you in Composing. My men could move this machine over without turning a wheel. I'll give you all the support you need. money, parts, assistance. What's the matter? Miss Hackett, I'm only interested in the progress of journalism. Of course! I would give you this machine for nothing if 'The Star' were a great newspaper. It's not great. It's not a newspaper. It's a cheap collection of words garbage that you call journalism that will die. What are you. A parrot or an inventor? If you have mechanical genius, use it. You're too brilliant a man to ape Mr Mitchell and repeat his little paragraphs of envy. I like you Mr Mergenthaler. I respect you. And I want you. But understand, that unless 'The Star' gets this machine. All your hard work will be buried on Park Row. Without a trial or a tombstone. Miss Hackett.if I need a tombstone. friend Mitch will buy it for me. Like he bought one for you. That's much better. makes you look much younger. Don't you think so, Mr Vandenberg? Did he turn you down, Charity? Who'd turn her down? Obviously she didn't come over here to visit our steam press. She could've come over to visit ME. She's not that interested in morals of an editor. I have a sneaking suspicion she just failed in attempt to shanghai Mr Mergenthaler. - Is the editor here? - I'm the editor. I want to give a penny for the Statue of Liberty. Thank you very much. what's your name? Martha Downs Poppa said I was a good girl for giving my penny. Rusty.you give Miss Downs a 'Globe' receipt for 1 penny. For the Statue of Liberty fund. Miss Hackett.would you care to donate a substantial sum? Not that I elect 'The Star' but at least there was some privacy for a man to think. Those separate little cells you've been working in, are all wrong. We'll have a real editorial department. with everybody in one office. And I can see what's going on. Sit down, Jeff. Got plenty of room? That's your copy desk. From now on you're in 'The Slot'. When are you going to get a telegraph, Mitch? It's a lot more important than taking down these walls. We need a wire service. I was over at Associated Press. You know what they want for their service, for a week? $300! Well, the AP's worth it. Sure..sure.I was just thinking. If I had $300 what would I do with it? I'd get myself a lot of good newsprint. the finest paper money could buy. And I'd come out with a REAL headline. Big.bold.120point Where would you get such big type, Mitch? I'd make it. Cut it out of wood myself. It'd have to be a big story. Mr Davenport.when you ran a story. Why do you always put '30' at the bottom? 30 is a symbol to all printers. That means it's the end of the story. There isn't any more. Is it hard to tell with the story? Well, if you see a dog running down the street with a can tied to its tail that's nothing. But if it stops turns around unties the can and throws it away that's a story. I'd like to have a dog like that. You wanna bet? You got a lot of them right here. Type lice. They are little teeny-weeny insects and they live right inside here. And they get fed by the ink that sticks to the type. You never see them, Rusty? They have a lot of fun and play games. Can I look at them? I don't know. If Mr Mitchell think you got ink in your blood, you can look. Can I look at them, Mr Mitchell? What do YOU think, Mr Davenport? Why do we put 30 at the end of copy? Because it's the end of a story. There ain't no more. Alright, Mr Angelo. let him look. Look down, Rusty.way down. Now you're a real printer's devil! There always will be type lice. even if my machine will work. There'll always be type lice. He's got to do something about increasing circulation. A lot of people have tried to figure out new methods of selling papers. I've been thinking about fish. Yeah..they got fish carts out there. They can sell fish right on the street. What's fish got to do with newspapers? Why not sell papers from a pushcart.? Have a stand. Newsstand.a 'Globe' newsstand. I do not write words to be peddled from the street, from a pushcart, like fish. What do you think, Mr Davenport? Well I think there's sufficient wood in here for at least 3 newsstands. You mind, Mr Leach? No.might be able to squeeze 4 out of it. We can use the room, anyway. There is that Frenchman. he's going into "The Star." That's the Frenchman who's connected with the statue, alright. Maybe Hackett's gonna give him a big cheque for the pedestal. If she'd just pull the curtains, we could see what was going on. <i>C'est les bonne mani√®res n'√©xistent pas!</i> <i>Vous.vous les auriez en fran√ßais.</i> <i>Mademoiselle, vous me confondez. c'est vous que je veux dire.</i> <i>Mais, c'est tr√®s difficile, je crois. </i> <i>Qu'on vais, gentil homme, pour associe √™tre un hypocrite.</i> <i>Pardon.je ne comprend pas de tout!</i> <i>C'est du camouflage.</i> <i>Du camouflage!</i> <i>Camouflage!</i> She's going to tell the whole world that my country gave America the statue just to camouflage a loan! Just a minute, Mr Dessard. Did she say WHEN she was going to tell the world? O√π? Not 'where'.WHEN!? WHEN is she going to tell the world? You've got to be exact, Mr Dessard. the newspaper has to be factual. Now, it's a very important story. but it's no good unless we get the facts! Demain.tomorrow! You're sure?! Oui.oui.TOMORROW! TOM.get a pen and paper. You're going to draw a picture of a beautiful woman. I want an extra 10,000 copies on the street this morning! They're loading the wagons right now. You'll be the first paper out today. Oh, you look pleased with the editorial, Mr Spiro! Changed your mind about being factual? I'm looking at 'The Globe.' He's not only beat you with your own story but he's been out on the street for 15 minutes. And there's something else new. Newsstands.and every one of them is marked 'The Globe'. How was the banquet? That was news. I wrote down a few highlights. The choice is yours. AFL.the American Federation of Labor It was organised tonight. The Printer's Union's joined it. The other side of the cuff, Mitch. That's an interesting item, too. ANPA. American Newspaper Publishers Association. It'll officially be an organisation at the end of this year. Got a list of the publishers? You should've been there. Likes of Met men like Pulitzer Dana.Bennett.Reid Jones of 'The Times'! Was she alone? I didn't think that was important enough to notice. Just a question. I thought maybe she was with some out-of-town publisher. No, she was alone as usual. Does that type of woman appeal to you? Look, Mr Davenport. You're an old man, but you're not senile. That's why I hired you. You're very virile mentally. And a question like that isn't exactly proof of mental virility. What DO you think of her? I don't. As long as you're on the subject. There's very little I can add. Right back on the first paragraph again. All I can tell you is her name is Charity of which she has none. If you had to write her obituary. What would you write? Yeah. I could tell you. If I had to write her obit. "Charity Hackett, publisher of 'The Star', is dead." "She was ruthless.and ambitious." "Her beauty was like an almanac." "It lasted unto her death." Her face was better than all the letters of recommendation in the world. Poise.a privilege of nature. Her voice a short-lived sonata. You're in love with a corpse, my boy. Banquet over? No. Glad you dropped in. I was just going over the list of publishers. My story would be incomplete without a quote from you. Sometimes it takes more than a quote to complete a story, Mr Mitchell. That's why I dropped in. Alright.complete the story. Well.I was in the midst of champagne. ..and I came to the decision that it would be a very good idea if we got married. Oh.a merger. Your masthead and mine. We could elope with tomorrow's first issue. It'd be a wonderful honeymoon Not on a biological basis, but. A mass circulation of 'The Star-Globe.' You know, I was just thinking. I could buy a ton and a half of newsprint with that coat. Oh, you could have a lot of things I have. A large staff. A circulation wagon. Wide distribution. Money. Contact. You could be the most famous editor in New York. And by the way, this coat is worth 5 tons of newsprint. Alright. It's a merger. But there'll be only one baby in the family. And we'll christen it 'The Globe.' I'll complete the story for you Mr Mitchell. Yes, Miss Hackett? Mr Mitchell's sensational treatment of the news coupled with a crusading spirit can easily develop into grave competition. I agree, Miss Hackett. Then why haven't you done something about it? I have no jurisdiction over the editorial policy of this newspaper. There is no editorial policy that can beat him. Mr Wiley. Yes? I want you to stop his source of supply. Paper.type.ink. 'The Globe' will be dead next week. Thugs are breaking up our newsstands. Come on! Where's Hackett? What's the matter? Busting up my newsstands isn't going to stop me from selling papers. Busting up your what? I thought you were a newspaperman! Where's Leach? You wanted an editorial department so I turned his desk around and now you can see everything that's going on. Alright, where's Leach? He went to South Street at the fish market to try and get some paper. He better come back loaded with paper. I'll give you some copy in a minute, Mr Angelo. Jeff, we're going to tell this town all about Hackett's circulation tactics. I want you to get this in the lead. We're going to fight with news, not knuckles. We use words.not fists! What happened to you? They killed the horses. Burned the wagon. dumped our paper. Where's Rusty? They ran over him.both legs! Will he live? - I don't know. - Will he walk? They don't know.he's at the hospital. Who ran over him? 'Monk' Rodgers. I know him! Get him! Hackett, you ran over a 'Globe' man. Killing horses.burning borrowed wagons. ..and dumping newsprint isn't going to stop me coming out every day! You've started a war, Hackett! A circulation war and I'll finish it! Mr Spiro.go back to your desk. Please! Mr Wiley.I don't want an explanation. I just want to tell you one thing. I do not have to resort to physical violence to compete with 'The Globe' or any other newspaper. You have done an affront to me and an insult to 'The Star.' What do YOU want? You're certain that I was responsible for this circulation war. Well that's not important. It's important that you and I have a truce. A little late to believe in a white flag. we've already suffered a casualty. There'll be more casualties if we don't stop the violence. I'm going to the hospital to find out about Rusty. Just running down a kid, kind of got your attention, eh? Look, I fired Mr Wiley. Someone had to give the order to kill 'The Globe.' Did they tell you Rusty might lose both his legs? Thick iron wheels ran over them. THAT wide! 'The Star' has got the only wagons in town with wheels that wide. Why don't you run over old Mr Davenport? He's a nice old man about ready to die. It'd be a great story if he died for a paper, wouldn't it? What about little Mr Angelo? You'd only need a little wagon to crush his little body. I want to see the editor. You're talking to him. I thought you'd print the name of every contributor to the Liberty Fund. We do. I gave $5 last week and I've never seen my name in the paper yet. What's your name? Taylor.George Taylor. Taylor, eh? No George Taylor in here. Here's my receipt. Where did you get this? What do you mean, where did I get it? Who gave you this receipt? I don't know his name. Look, mister.I run a little smoke shop down in The Bowery. I've been there for 20 years and I've got a good name. I don't like your tone. I gave $5 in good faith. You put my name in the paper, or give me my $5 back. I can't put your name in the paper, Mr Taylor and I can't give you your $5 back. Because we never received it. This is a forged receipt. it's not ours. I'm sorry. - Where is this Mr Mitchell? - I'm Mr Mitchell. I gave $25 for the pedestal and not a single mention of my name in 'The Globe'.' And my husband gave $50, Mr Mitchell! $50! - Did you get your money back, Georg? - No I didn't. Mitchell, I been around this street a long time. And I hate seeing a paper using its pages to cheat the public. I gave $7 to the Liberty Fund and I haven't seen MY name in 'The Globe'. And a lot of my friends are holding receipts. We're beginning to think you're using this patriotic gesture to pocket the money. Now if we don't get our money back, I'm going to see that Washington hears about it. It's only to prevent a tragedy that I've come here to see you. Someone is passing forged receipts for the pedestal fund. The Attorney General of the United States ordered Mitch to return all money to subscribers. Why don't you like me? I don't dislike you, Charity. I'm simply not fond of you. If you were fighting The Tribune, World, Herald, The Sun. That would be a real fight. But you're fighting 'The Globe' because Mitch excites you. Antagonises you. And outwits you. You're jealous of him. And you've made it a personal newspaper war. I could understand, if you love him. You and I both know, you'll never get him. You come from a great line of newspaper people. But you.you're not of our profession. Only on the surface. I'm glad you're a woman. For when you die, the name of Hackett shall die with you. Hey.barmaid!.Cute, eh? You patriotic? Want to give some boodle for the Liberty statue? Just give me what you can, and I'll call you patriotic. Sure, I'm patriotic. Here's a dollar, mister. And here's your receipt. Watch 'The Globe' paper for your name. Come on, Red. Wait a minute! Don't you want to see the first barmaid in America, to make a you special drink? No, we gotta go. I'll make you a Blue Blazer. On the house! I can make the best Blue Blazer you ever saw. Anybody getting money for that pedestal. they deserve more than a Blue Blazer. You know what. I got lots of patriotic customers here. I bet you I can get you $20 for that pedestal. Got any more of them receipts? My father gave $10 for the statue. I heard today that Ed Shore gave $100 And my father's brother gave $20 for the statue and his brother-in-law gave $30. Now wasn't that worth waiting for? That's what I call a Blue Blazer! A shot of allagazam. and a shot of sangaree. As a matter of fact I even put in a bit of sheep-dip. Now that's what you call a Blue Blazer! Was that worth waiting for? That's a Blue Blazer mixed with a shot of allagazam and a shot of sangaroo. A you sure they're on the house? Sure they're on the house. for anybody that's patriotic. Steve.that's the guy with the forged receipts! You know what I did to the man who ran over the kid's legs. And I'll crush your head in with this unless you tell me who's paying you to pass those Liberty receipts. You can't scare me. Wiley of 'The Star' 's behind me. I ain't afraid of you or your paper. That's the story I want. Turn him over to the federal authorities. and WE'll pick up the newsprint. Mr Davenport, I want you to write the story exposing Hackett. You can tell them there'll be a Statue of Liberty on Beddoes Island in less than 60 days. I guess that's the big story for your 120-point headline. Don't tell me about it, Mr Davenport. write it! Are you hurt? Are you alright? Hey Jack.give me that pail of beer. Mr Mergenthaler.are you alright? Yeah. What about Mr Davenport? He was gone before it happened. Gone where? Wrote his story and said goodnight. and went home. Give me a hand. Let's get him in the other room. Are you alright Mr Mergenthaler? Did you get a good look at any of them? No.they were too fast. They had it all figured out like clockwork. Each man knew where to hurt it most. Well, it'll just mean we come out a little later.that's all. Jeff.find that story Mr Davenport wrote. Mr Angelo, let's sort out this type. It'll take us a month.the state of this type. Look.they threw mailing glue all over it. May take more than a month. We got a lot of paper out there. we can't let it go to waste. We can't afford to miss a single edition. Mr Davenport's story isn't here. What do you mean it isn't there?. It's got to be there.someplace. Look around over there. I'll look on his desk. What is it, Mr Mitchell? It's Davenport's obituary. Who wrote it, Mr Mitchell? Mr Davenport. Read it, Mr Mitchell. Josiah Davenport, 75. Journalist. Died today, at peace with Park Row. The search for a man to carry on the fire for Horace Greeley was successful. His last words were written to this man Phineas Mitchell, 'The Globe'. In most countries there is no freedom of the press. In the United States, there is. It's freedom was born in 1734. in the libel trial of John Peter Zenger printer and publisher of the New York Weekly Journal. He was acquitted by a jury. When anyone threatens your freedom to print the truth think of Zenger, Franklin, Bennett. and Greeley. Think of them.fight for what they fought for and died for. Don't let anyone ever tell you what to print. Don't take advantage of your free press. Use it judiciously, for your profession and your country. The press is good, or evil according to the character of those who direct it and 'The Globe' is a good newspaper. I have put off dying waiting for a new voice that would be heard. You are that new voice, Mr Mitchell. And now that I have found a man worthy enough to die for. I'm ready to die. The old press is silent. If there's a place where newspapermen go. ..and a last edition is put to bed I want to be there to hear the roar of 'The Globe'. ..the thunder of the type. I want to be there, still covering the story on the cuff of the last of the survivors who saw American journalism born on Park Row. '30'. It's hot! It's type! Can you make a sentence? Go ahead. What do you call this, Mr Mergenthaler? Line of type. Mr Leach.get that press beating. Mr Angelo, railroad those formes. Steve.get that butcher paper in there. Jeff, get started on the copy. We'll put Mr Davenport's obituary right on page 1.and we'll box it. I'll write the Hackett expos√©. Mr Mergenthaler.if I give you my story right here can you get the words out of your line o' type as I talk? 'Linotype'.that is a good name for my machine! Here's your lead. The press is good or evil according to the character of those who direct it. And now that the story is revealed 'The Globe' will continue its subscription drive for the Lady in New York Bay. Hey.Jeff! Look at that. a special Sunday Extra. "Fourth of July"! Look at that headline.. 120-point! Look at that paper.in Linotype! This is history, Jeff.. This is history! How's the press..will she live? She's in bad shape. There'll be no 'Globe' out tomorrow, Mr Mitchell. Well, you can all start looking for new jobs. Sure is a wake for the dead. What plans I had for you! This was just the beginning. So many things I wanted to print fight. ..expose make history together. We started something new newspaper business. I had it all figured out. All figured out. Re-plates.newsstands. Railroad stations. By-lines for good writers. Columns. 'The Globe'.is dead. Long live 'The Globe'. Extra, extra.read all about it. Extra.read all about it.extra! I'm surprised at you Mr Mitchell. You had a paper to put out. .and what do you do?. You go to a saloon. How did you do it? My machine. We had the copy. While you were filling your belly with schnapps I was on the linotype. The explosion burnt it a little but I fixed it quickly. Where'd you get the press? Right across the street. I came in here after the explosion. I read your page-1 story. I didn't order the violence. Mr Wiley did. He blew up your pressroom. I am responsible, because I gave him the order to kill 'The Globe'. In doing that I violated the Publishers' Code. That's why I borrowed your staff for the paper make-up. And I printed 'The Globe'. Good ink. The best. 8 pages! On your newsprint. Your headline deserved it. How many on the street. 12,000. We're doing what you always wanted to do. By noon there'll be 4 different editions of 'The Globe' on the street. And to complete the story, Mr Mitchell. I didn't commit newspaper suicide, because i love you. No.I killed my newspaper so yours could be born. Because I read Mr Davenport's obituary. And for the first time I really see what you're fighting for. That's why I'm giving you the Park Row. And when you see this monument on Beddoes Island this memorable day of October 28, 1886. I want the whole world to know that we have a Statue of Liberty because of a newspaper. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG Hey! Hey! There he is! Where's he going? -Bastard! Stop! You won't get away, sir! Time to pay your debt. Hey! Did you hear what I was playing, Lane? I didn't think it polite to listen, sir. I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play accurately-- anyone can play accurately-- but I play with wonderful expression. Yes, sir. Bills. bills. bills-- all I ever get is bills. And then there's the matter. of my unpaid wages. sir. Yet again the wasteful habits of my brother Ernest. tear me from my duties here. Yes, sir. It's a terrible nuisance, but there's nothing to be done. I shall return Monday afternoon. Yes, sir. Pay particular attention. if you will. Miss Prism. to her German grammar. Yes, Mr. Worthing. I don't suppose you've found my cigarette case. have you, Merriman? We'restill looking, sir. Walk on. Hey! Excuse me. Ernest! -Algy! -How are you, my dear Ernest? -What brings you up to town? -Oh, pleasure, pleasure. What else should bring one anywhere? Where have you been since last Thursday? In the country. You're always in the country. What on earth do you do there? Well, when one is in town, one amuses oneself. When one is in the country, one amuses other people. It's excessively boring. -Who are these people you amuse? -Oh, neighbors, neighbors. Nice neighbors in your part of Shropshire? Perfectly horrid. Never speak to one of them. How immensely you must amuse them. By the way, Shropshire is your country, is it not? -What? -Shropshire. -Shropshire? -Mm. Oh, yes, of course. Say. dear boy. What plans have you got for tea tomorrow? You know perfectly well. that Aunt Augusta is coming to tea tomorrow. -Aunt Augusta? -Yes. Aunt Augusta. And Gwendolen. How perfectly delightful. Perhaps I might pay my respects. Yes, that is all very well, but I'm afraid Aunt Augusta. won't approve of your being there. Why do you say that? My dear fellow, the way that you flirt with Gwendolen. is perfectly disgraceful. It's almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you. -I am in love with Gwendolen. -Ahh. And I have come up to town expressly to propose to her. I thought you came up for pleasure. I call that business. Oh, how utterly unromantic you are. I really don't see what there is romantic about proposing. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. And then--Ha ha!-- the excitement is over. No. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. Twenty-five a player. Anyway, I certainly can't see. you and Gwendolen being married. Why on earth do you say that? Well, in the first place, I don't give my consent. Your consent? My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my cousin. and before I allow you to marry her. you shall have to clear up this whole question of Cecily. -Cecily? -Mm. What on earth do you mean? I don't know anyone by the name of Cecily. Do you mean you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish to goodness you had let me know. I've been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard. I was very nearly offering a very large reward. I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up. It makes no matter. for I see now the thing isn't yours after all. Of course it's mine. You have seen me with it a hundred times. Not according to the inscription. And you have no right whatsoever. to read what is written inside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing. to read a private cigarette case. Yes, but this isn't your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a present from someone. of the name of Cecily, and you said. you didn't know anyone of that name. Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt. Your aunt? Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy. Yes, but why does your aunt call you her uncle? "From little Cecily, with her fondest love. "to her dear Uncle Jack." Mmm. There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt. but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be. should call her own nephew her uncle. I can't quite make out. Besides, your name isn't Jack at all--it's Ernest. It isn't Ernest, it's Jack. You've always told me it was Ernest. I've introduced you to everyone as Ernest. It is perfectly absurd your saying your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards. Here is one of them. "Mr. Ernest Worthing, B.4, The Albany." Well, it is Ernest in town and Jack in the country. and the cigarette case was given to me in the country. So I've always pretended to have a younger brother. Ah, of the name of Ernest. And little Cecily? My ward, Miss Cecily Cardew. Where is that place in the country. by the way? That is nothing to you. dear boy. You are certainly not going to be invited. I may tell you candidly the place is not in Shropshire. Oh, I suspected that, my dear fellow. just as I suspected you to be a Bunburyist. Indeed, you are one of the most advanced. Bunburyists I know. See you at five. Moncrieff! A quick word, sir! "Bunburyist"? Cecily, your German grammar is on the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday's lesson. But I don't like German. It isn't at all a becoming language. I know perfectly well. I look quite plain after my German lesson. Child, you know how anxious your guardian is. that you should improve yourself in every way. Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious. Sometimes I think he is so serious he cannot be quite well. Cecily, I'm surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life. You must remember his constant anxiety. about that unfortunate young man, his brother. I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man. his brother, to come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him, Miss Prism. I'm not sure that I would desire to reclaim him. I'm not in favor of this modern mania. for turning bad people into good people. at a moment's notice. Cecily? Do your work. child. He, she, it praises. "Bunburyist"? What on earth do you mean by a "Bunburyist"? You have invented a very useful younger brother. called Ernest in order that you may be able. to come up to town as often as you like. I have invented. an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury. in order that I may be able to go down. to the country as often as I choose. If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health. for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you. at the Savoy tonight, for I've had an appointment. with Aunt Augusta for more than a week. I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere tonight. I know. You're absurdly careless. about giving out invitations. Don't touch the cucumber sandwiches. They were ordered especially for Aunt Augusta. You've been eating them all the time. Well, that is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. That must be her. Only relatives or creditors ever ring. in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I manage to get her out of the way for 10 minutes. so that you may have an opportunity. for proposing to Gwendolen. may I dine with you at the Savoy tonight? Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax. Good afternoon, dear Algy. I hope you are behaving very well. I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta. That's not quite the same thing. In fact, the two things rarely go together. Lady Bracknell, l-- Oh, goodness, you are smart. I'm always smart. Am I not, Mr. Worthing? You are quite perfect, Miss Fairfax. I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for development. and I intend to develop in many directions. I'm sorry if we're a little late. Algy. I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury. I had not been there since her poor husband's death. I never saw a woman so altered. She looks quite twenty years younger. And now I'll have a cup of tea and one of those. nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me. Certainly, Aunt Augusta. Won't you sit here, Gwendolen? Thanks, Mama, I'm quite comfortable where I am. Good heavens, Lane, why are there no cucumber sandwiches? There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. -I went down twice. -Oh, no cucumbers? No, sir. Not even for ready money. -That will do, Lane. -Thank you, sir. I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta. about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money. It really makes no matter, Algy. I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury. I've got quite a treat for you tonight, Algy. I'm going to send you down with Mary Farquhar. -She is such a nice-- -I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta. I shall have to give up the pleasure. of dining with you tonight. I hope not, Algy. It will put my table completely out. It is a great bore, and I need hardly say. a terrible disappointment to me. but I've just had a telegram to say. that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. They seem to think I should be with him. Very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer. from curiously bad health. Yes, poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid. I must say. Algy. I think it is high time. Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether to live or die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. I should be much obliged if you would ask. Mr. Bunbury from me to be kind enough. not to have a relapse next Saturday. It is my last reception, and I rely on you. to arrange my music for me. I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta. if he's still conscious. Now, if you'll follow me into the next room. I'll run over the musical program. I've already drawn up for the occasion. Thank you, Algy. It is very thoughtful of you. Gwendolen, you will accompany me. Certainly, Mama. Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax. Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people talk to me about the weather. I always feel quite certain that they mean something else. and that makes me so nervous. -I do mean something else. -I thought so. And I would like to take advantage. of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence-- I would certainly advise you to do so. Mama has a way of coming back suddenly into a room. that I've often had to speak to her about. Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you. I have admired you more than any girl. I have ever met since I met you. Yes. I'm quite aware of the fact. And I often wish that in public, at any rate. you had been more demonstrative. For me. you have always had an irresistible fascination. Gwendolen-- Even before I met you. I was far from indifferent to you. We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing. in an age of ideals, and my ideal has always been. to love someone of the name of Ernest. There's something in that name. that inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algy first mentioned to me. that he had a friend called Ernest. I knew I was destined to love you. -You really love me, Gwendolen? -Passionately. Darling, you don't know how happy you've made me. My own Ernest. You don't mean to say though, dear. you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest. But your name is Ernest. Yes, I know it is. but supposing it was something else? Ah. Well, that is clearly a metaphysical speculation. and like most metaphysical speculations. has very little reference at all. to the actual facts of real life as we know them. Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly. I don't much care about the name of Ernest. I don't think it suits me at all. It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own. It produces vibrations. Well, really, Gwendolen. I must say I think there are lots of other much nicer names. I think. Jack, for instance, a charming name. Jack? I've known several Jacks, and they all. without exception, were more than usually plain. Mm. The only really safe name is Ernest. Gwendolen, we must get married at once. Married, Mr. Worthing? Well, surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe. Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me. I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet. Nothing's been said at all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on. Gwendolen. Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you to say to me? You know what I have to say to you. Yes, but you don't say it. Gwendolen, will you marry me? Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most indecorous. Mama! I must beg you to retire. Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet. Finished what, may I ask? I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, Mama. Pardon me. Gwendolen. You are not engaged to anyone. When you do become engaged to someone. I or your father, should his health permit him. will inform you of the fact. You will wait for me below in the carriage. -Mama-- -ln the carriage, Gwendolen. Gwendolen! The carriage! I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Worthing. you are not down on my list of eligible young men. However, I'm quite ready. to enter your name as a possible candidate. Perhaps you would attend a meeting at my house. at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. I shall have a few questions to put to you. Algernon? So. did you tell Gwendolen the truth. about being Ernest in town and Jack in the country? My dear fellow. the truth isn't quite the sort of thing. one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What extraordinary ideas you have. about the way to behave to a woman. The only way to behave to a woman. is to make love to her if she's pretty. and to someone else if she is plain. That is nonsense. You never talk anything but nonsense. Well, nobody ever does. Oh, my dear fellow, you forgot to pay the bill. Not at all. I make it a point never to pay at the Savoy. Why on earth not? You have heaps of money. Yes, but Ernest hasn't. and he's got quite a reputation to keep up. Cecily? More intellectual pleasures await you, my child. You should put away your diary, Cecily. I really don't see why you should keep a diary at all. I keep a diary in order to enter. the wonderful secrets of my life. If I didn't write them down. I should probably forget all about them. Memory, my dear Cecily. is the diary that we all carry about with us. I believe memory is responsible. for nearly all these three-volume novels. people write nowadays. Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days. Did you really, Miss Prism? I hope it did not end happily. The good ended happily and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means. Do your work, child. These speculations are profitless. But I see dear Dr. Chasuble. coming through the garden. Oh, Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure. And how are we today? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well. Miss Prism has just been complaining. of a slight headache. I think it would do her. so much good to have a short stroll with you. in the park, Dr. Chasuble. Cecily! I have not mentioned anything about a headache. No. dear Miss Prism. I know that. but I felt instinctively that you had a headache. Indeed, I was thinking about that. and not my German lesson when the rector came along. I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive. -I am afraid I am. -That's strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism's pupil. I would hang upon her lips. I spoke metaphorically. My metaphor was drawn from.bees. Ahem. I shall, um. see you both, no doubt, at Evensong. Good luck, sir. Ernest! -This way, sir. -Shall I, uh-- You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing. Thank you, Lady Bracknell. I prefer standing. Do you smoke? Well, yes, I must admit I smoke. I'm glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. -How old are you? -Thirty-five. A very good age to be married at. I've always been of opinion. that a man who desires to get married. should know either everything or nothing. Which do you know? I know nothing, Lady Bracknell. I'm pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers. with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate, exotic fruit. Touch it, and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education. is radically unsound. Fortunately, in England, at any rate. education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did. it would prove a serious danger. to the upper classes and probably lead. to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. -What is your income? -Between 7 and 8,000 a year. -ln land or in investments? -ln investments, chiefly. Oh, that is satisfactory. I have a country house with some land. of course, attached to it. About 1,500 acres, I believe. You have a town house, I hope. A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature like Gwendolen. could hardly be expected to reside in the country. Well, of course I also own a house in Belgrave Square. -Number? -A hundred and forty-nine. The unfashionable side. I thought there was something. However, that could easily be altered. Do you mean the fashion or the side? Well, both, if necessary, I presume. Are your parents living? I have lost both my parents. To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing. may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was evidently a man of some wealth. I'm afraid I really don't know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth. to say my parents seem to have lost me. I actually don't know who I am by birth. I was-- Well, I was found. Found? The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman. of a very charitable and kindly disposition. found me and gave me the name of Worthing. because he happened to have a first-class ticket. for Worthing in his pocket at the time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort. And where did this charitable gentlemen. with a first-class ticket for the seaside resort. find you? In a handbag. -A handbag? -Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a handbag-- a somewhat large, um, black leather handbag. with handles to it. An ordinary handbag, in fact. In what locality did this Mr. James or Thomas Cardew. come across this ordinary handbag? In the cloakroom at Victoria Station. It was given him in mistake for his own. The cloakroom at Victoria Station? Yes. The Brighton line. The line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I am somewhat bewildered. by what you have just told me. To be born or at any rate bred in a handbag. whether it has handles or not. seems to me to display a contempt. for the ordinary decencies of family life. which remind one of the worst excesses. of the French Revolution. And I presume you know. what that unfortunate movement led to. May I ask you then. what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I would do anything. in the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness. I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing. to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible. and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate. one parent of either sex before the season is quite over. I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce the handbag at any moment. It's in my storeroom at home. I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell. Me, sir? What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell. would dream of allowing our only daughter-- a girl brought up with the utmost care-- to marry into a cloakroom. and form an alliance with a parcel. Good morning, Mr. Worthing. Good morning. You don't think there's any chance of Gwendolen becoming. Iike her mother in about 150 years, do you, Algy? My dear fellow, all women become. Iike their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, and that's his. Is that clever? It's perfectly phrased and about as true. as any observation in civilized life should be. Ernest. -Gwendolen! -Ernest, my dear Ernest. Algy, please, I have something. very particular to say to Mr. Worthing. My own darling. Ernest, the story of your romantic origin. as related to me by Mama with unpleasing comments. has naturally stirred the deeper fibers of my nature. I followed you here to reassure you. that there is nothing that she can possibly do. can alter my eternal devotion to you. Dear Gwendolen. Your town address at The Albany I have. What is your address in the country? The Manor. Woolton. Hertfordshire. I will communicate with you daily. My own one. Yes. I must confess. I do smoke. I know nothing. Lady Bracknell. I can produce the handbag at a moment's notice. Shh! Shh. Before you can be found. in a handbag at a railway station. someone must have lost you in a handbag. at a railway station. Do you see? In the first place, what with Lady Bracknell. sniffing about, dear, dissolute Ernest. is a risk I can no longer afford. And secondly, Cecily is becoming a little too much. interested in him. It's rather a bore. I'd rather like to meet Cecily. Well. I shall take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty and only just eighteen. No, I'll say he died in Paris of apoplexy. But it's hereditary, my dear fellow. It's the sort of thing that runs in families. You had much better say it was a severe chill. Very well. then. Poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly. in Paris by a severe chill. That gets rid of him. Have you told Gwendolen that you have. an excessively pretty ward who's only just eighteen? No. One doesn't blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain. to become extremely great friends. I bet you anything half an hour after they've met. they will be calling each other sister. Women only do that when they have. called each other a lot of other things first. Don't let me disturb you. I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane. It never is, sir. You are a perfect pessimist. I do my best to give satisfaction, sir. Thank you. You can put out my dress clothes. my smoking jacket. and even bring on the curling tongs. Yes, sir. Tomorrow, Lane. I'm going Bunburying. Yes. sir. That must be it over there. Bring it down there, Mr. Smithers. Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. Yes. Miss. You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure. You are under some strange mistake. I'm not little. In fact, I believe. I'm more than usually tall for my age. But I am your cousin Cecily. And you--you, I see from your card. are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest. My wicked cousin Ernest. I'm not really wicked at all, Cousin Cecily. You mustn't think that I'm wicked. Well, if you are not, then you've certainly. been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner. Well, I have been rather reckless. I'm glad to hear it. In fact, now that you mention the subject. I have been very bad in my own small way. Well, I don't think you should be so proud of that. though I am sure it must've been very pleasant. It's much pleasanter being here with you. I can't understand how you're here at all. Uncle Jack won't be back till Monday afternoon. Oh, that is a great disappointment. I'm obliged to go out. by the first train on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I'm anxious to miss. That's all very well, but still. I think you had better wait until Uncle Jack arrives. I know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating. About my what? Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia. Australia? I'd sooner die. He said at dinner on Wednesday night. that you would have to choose between this world. the next world, and Australia. Oh, well. The accounts I have received of Australia. and the next world are not particularly. encouraging, Cousin Cecily. This world is good enough for me. Yes, but are you good enough for it? No, I'm afraid not. That is why I want you to reform me. You might make that your mission. if you don't mind, Cousin Cecily. I'm afraid I've no time this afternoon. Well,wouldyou mind me. reforming myself this afternoon? It is rather quixotic of you, but I think you should try. I will. -I feel better already. -You're looking a little worse. Well, that's because I'm hungry. -Mr. Worthing! -Mr. Worthing! This is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday afternoon. I have returned sooner than I expected. Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe. does not betoken some terrible calamity. My brother. More shameful debts and extravagance. Still leading a life of pleasure. Dead. Your brother Ernest is dead? Quite dead. What a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it. He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow. Yes. indeed. sad. Um, were you with him at the end? No. He died abroad. In Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night. from the manager of the Grand Hotel. Is the cause of death mentioned? A severe chill, it seems. As a man sows, so shall he reap. Oh, charity, Miss Prism, charity. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draft. Ah.ah.Ah-choo! Bless you. Uncle Jack, I'm so pleased to see you back. What is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy. You look as if you had toothache. and I have such a surprise for you. Who do you think is in the rose garden? Your brother. -Who? -Your brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago. Nonsense. I haven't got a brother. -I mean. -Well, he's. Come, he'll be so pleased to see you've returned so soon. I-- These are joyful tidings. Good heavens. Brother John, I've come down from town. to tell you that I'm very sorry. for all the trouble I have given you. and that I fully intend. to lead a better life in the future. Well, what can I say? The old Ernest is dead. Long live the new Ernest. I thought you'd like my little joke. Your little joke? Knowing me as you do, brother John. I'm surprised you took it so seriously. At any rate, I stand before you now. an entirely new man, risen, as it were. Iike a phoenix from the ashes. Uncle Jack, you're not going to refuse. your own brother's hand. Nothing would induce me to take his hand. I think his behavior utterly disgraceful. He knows perfectly well why! Do shake his hand, Uncle Jack. After all, it could be worse. I could be dead in Paris. You could, indeed. Of a severe chill. Sorry about that, Jack. Shake. Go on. Excuse me, sir. We're putting Mr. Ernest's things. in the blue room on the second floor. Very nice to see you, Doctor. Do tell me, when is confession? What? Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir. We're taking it up to the blue room. -His luggage? -Yes, sir. Two portmanteaus, two dressing cases. two hat boxes, and a large luncheon basket. I fear I can only stay a week this time. Heh heh. -You scoundrel, Algy. -Mm? What have you to say for yourself? What I have to say, Uncle Jack. is that little Cecily is a darling. You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that! I don't like it. Your vanity is ridiculous. your conduct an outrage, and your presence. in my house utterly absurd! However, you have got to catch the four-five train. I hope you have a pleasant journey back to town. This Bunburying, as you call it. has not been a great success for you. It's pleasant. is it not. to see so perfect a reconciliation. I think it's been a great success. Dinner is served. Cecily. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have an appetite unless I have a buttonhole. Mr. Worthing. -Marigold? -No. I'd sooner have a pink rose. Why? Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily. I don't think it could be right. for you to talk to me like that. Miss Prism never says such things to me. Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. You are the prettiest girl I ever saw. You see, Uncle Jack, there is some good in everyone. Ernest has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend. whom he goes to visit so often. Oh, he has been talking about poor Mr. Bunbury, has he? And surely there must be much good. in one who is kind to an invalid. and leaves the pleasures of London. to sit by a bed of pain. Right. It's first class. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Dear Ernest. how desperately I have missed you. It seems an age since I last saw you. and our separation is now proving an intolerable strain. The feelings you have aroused within me. are at once delightful and exquisitely. painful. My dearest darling Ernest. it is your very name that inspires me now. to take my future in my hands-- burnt. as it were. into my very being. And so it is. I have resolved to flee these prison walls. and make my way directly to your side. to my one and only. Ernest. Ernest. Algy. Algy. Ernest. Ah. Good morning, my dear fellow. We have to talk. You have to leave. If I leave, how can we talk? Wcannot boh becalled Ernest I don't believe we are, Brother Jack. I believe you are praiseworthy. He, she, it praises. You're snoring? I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you. if I state quite openly and frankly. You seem to me to be in every way. the visible personification of absolute perfection. I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary. Do you keep a diary? I'd give anything to see it. Oh, no. You'd see it as simply a very young girl's record. of her own thoughts and impressions. But, pray, Ernest, I delight in taking down from dictation. You can go on. Don't cough, Ernest. When one is dictating. one should speak fluently and not cough. Cecily, ever since I first looked upon. your wondrous and incomparable beauty. I have dared to love you-- wildly. wildly. -passionately. -Ahem. devotedly, hopelessly. I beg your pardon, sir. There are two gentlemen wishing to see you. -Mr. Ernest Worthing? -Yes. -Of B.4, The Albany? -Yes, that is my address. I am very sorry. sir. but I have a writ of attachment against you. and the suit of the Savoy Hotel Company Limited. for 762 pounds, 14 shillings. What perfect nonsense. I never dine at the Savoy at my own expense. In the interests of our clients. we have no option but to take out an order. for committal of your person. -Committal? Of my person? -For six months. Oh, for six months? Ha ha! No doubt you'll prefer to pay the bill. Pay it? How on earth am I going to do that? No gentleman ever has any money. In my experience, it is usually relations who pay. Oh, all right. Uh, Brother Jack? 762 pounds, 14 shillings, and a tuppence-- since last October. I'm bound to say. I never saw such reckless extravagance in all my life. My dear fellow, how ridiculous you are. You have your debts, and I have mine. You know quite well this bill is really yours. -Mine? -Yes, and you know it. -Mr. Worthing. if this is another jest, it is most out of place. -lt is not. -lt is gross effrontery. Just what I expected from him. And it is ingratitude. I didn't expect that. Next thing you know. he'll be denying. he's Ernest Worthing in the first place. I'm sorry to disturb this so pleasant family meeting. but time presses. We have to be at Holloway not later than four o'clock. Otherwise, it is difficult to obtain admission. The rules are very strict. Holloway? But--Get off me! It is at Holloway that detentions of this character. are made away. I will not be imprisoned for having dined in the West End! Jack! I agree to settle my brother's accounts. on the condition that he makes his way without delay. to the bedside of the poor bed-ridden Bunbury. whose health, I have recently been informed. is rapidly declining. Well, Ernest? .it's only life. Mr. Worthing. I would ask you not to interrupt. Miss Cardew's studies. Miss Prism, I almost forgot to mention. that Dr. Chasuble is expecting you in the vestry. In the vestry? Dr. Chasuble? Expecting you, yes. That sounds serious. I do not think it would be right to keep him waiting, Cecily. It would be very, very wrong. The vestry is, I am told, excessively damp. This parting, Miss Cardew, is very painful. But I suppose you cannot desert. poor Mr. Bunbury in his hour of need. I don't care about Bunbury anymore. I don't seem to care about anything anymore. I only care for you. I love you, Cecily. Will you marry me, Cecily? Will you? Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three months. For the last three months? Yes. It will be exactly three months on Thursday. Darling. Aah! So, when was the engagement actually settled? On the fourteenth of February last. After a long struggle with myself. I accepted you under this dear old tree here. And this is the box in which I keep all your dear letters. My letters? But my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters. You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well. that I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three times a week and sometimes oftener. -Do let me look at them. -Oh, no, I couldn't possibly. They would make you far too conceited. The three you wrote after I had broken off the engagement. were so beautiful and so badly spelled. Even now I can hardly read them without crying a little. Was our engagement ever broken off? -Yes, of course it was. -What? On the twenty-second of last March. You can see the entry if you like. "Today I broke off my engagement with Ernest. "The weather still continues charming." Why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done nothing at all. I'm very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off. Particularly when the weather was so charming. Well, it would hardly have been a really serious engagement. if I hadn't broken it off at least once, Ernest. But I forgave you before the week was out. Oh, you're a perfect angel. -You dear romantic boy. -Mmm. You know, I never really thought of myself. as the marrying kind until now. You mustn't break it off again, Cecily. Well, I don't think I could break it off. now that I've actually met you. Besides, of course, there is the question of your name. Yes, of course. You mustn't laugh at me, darling. but it has always been a girlish dream of mine. to love someone whose name is Ernest. There's something in that name. that seems to inspire absolute confidence. My own dear joy, do you mean to say you couldn't love me. if I had another name? -But what name? -Well. Algy, for instance. I might respect you, Ernest. I might admire your character. but I fear that I would never be able to give you. my undivided attention. Mmm. Mmm. Ahem. The dog cart is ready for you, sir. -Ahem. -Ahem. And now you must go, my love. for sooner then shall you return. Oh, what a charming boy. I like his hair so much. You wanted to see me, Dr. Chasuble? I didn't. Oh. You didn't? Oh. I'm sorry. but merely for the purposes of clarification. when you said you didn't. did you mean you didn't say you wanted to see me. or that you didn't, in fact, want to see me? Isn't language a curious thing? Will you excuse me? I have a double baptism this afternoon. and I have to top up the font. Bless you. A Miss Fairfax has called to see Mr. Worthing-- on very important business, Miss Fairfax states. Mr. Worthing is sure to be out soon, Merriman. so kindly bring some tea. Yes, miss. -Miss Cardew. -Thank you. Miss Fairfax, pray let me introduce myself to you. My name is Cecily Cardew. Cecily Cardew. What a very sweet name. Something tells me we're going to be great friends. I like you already more than I can say. and my first impressions of people are never wrong. You're here on a short visit, I suppose. -Oh, no, I live here. -Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative. of advanced years resides here also. Oh, no. I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations. -lndeed. -My dear guardian. has the arduous task of looking after me. -Your guardian? -I'm Mr. Worthing's ward. Oh. It is strange. He never mentioned it. How secretive of him. Ha ha ha! He grows more interesting hourly. But I am bound to state that. now that I know you are Mr. Worthing's ward. I cannot help expressing a wish that you were. well, just a little bit older than you seem to be. and not quite so very alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly. Pray do. I think whenever one. has anything unpleasant to say. one should always be quite candid. Yes. Well, to speak with perfect candor, Cecily. I wish you were fully forty-two. and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a strong upright nature. He's the very soul of truth and honor. I think--I think Jack, for instance. Jack. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name. Oh. but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing. who's my guardian. It is his brother, his elder brother. Oh. That accounts for it. Cecily, you've lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost anxious. Of course, you're quite sure. it's not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian? Quite sure. In fact. I am going to be his. I beg your pardon? Mr. Ernest Worthing and l are engaged to be married. My darling Cecily, I think there must be some slight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement will appear in the Morning Post. on Saturday at the latest. I'm afraid you must be under some misconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. Oh, it's very curious, for he asked me to be his wife. yesterday afternoon at five thirty. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read. in the train. I'm so sorry, dear Cecily. but I'm afraid I have the prior claim. May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax? Thank you, Miss Cardew. Sugar? No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable anymore. Cake or bread and butter? Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen in the best houses nowadays. From the moment I saw you, I distrusted you. I felt that you were false and deceitful. It seems to me, Miss Fairfax. that I am trespassing on your valuable time. No doubt, you have many other calls. of a similar character to make in the neighborhood. Ernest. -You're back so soon. -My own love. A moment, Ernest. May I ask you-- are you engaged to be married to this young lady? What young lady? Good heavens, Gwendolen. Yes. to "Good heavens. Gwendolen. '" Of course not. What put such an idea. into your pretty little head? Thank you. You may. I felt there must be some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is now embracing you. is my cousin Mr. Algernon Moncrieff. Algernon? Moncrieff? -Yes. Algy. Here is Ernest. Oh. my own Ernest. Gwendolen, my darling. I knew there must be some misunderstanding. Miss Fairfax. The man whose arm is at present around your waist. is my guardian Mr. John Worthing. I beg your pardon? This is Uncle Jack. Jack? Are you called Algy? I cannot deny it. Is your name really John? I could deny it if I liked. I could deny anything if I liked. but it certainly is John. It has been John foryears. A gross deception has been practiced on both of us. -My poor wounded Cecily. -My sweet wronged Gwendolen. Ohh. You will call me sister, will you not? Of course. Let us go into the house. sister. They will hardly venture to come after us there. No. Men are so cowardly, aren't they? How you can sit there calmly eating muffins. when we're in this horrible trouble I can't make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless. I can hardly eat muffins in an agitated manner, can l? The butter would probably get on my cuffs. I say, it's perfectly heartless you're eating muffins at all. under the circumstances. When I'm in trouble. eating is my only consolation. Indeed, when I'm in really great trouble. as anyone who knows me intimately will tell you. I refuse everything except food and drink. At the present moment, I am eating muffins. because I am unhappy. Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins. There's no reason why you should eat them all. in that greedy way. Would you like some tea cake? I don't like tea cake. Good heavens. I suppose a man. may eat his own muffins in his own garden. They seem to be eating muffins. But you just said it was perfectly heartless. to eat muffins. I said it was perfectly heartless. of you under the circumstances. That is a very different thing. Maybe, but the muffins are the same. No. Give them to me! Well, I certainly don't rate your chances. with my ward, Algernon. Well, I don't think there's much likelihood. of you, Jack, and Miss Fairfax being united, Jack! But is there any particular infant. in whom you are interested, Mr. Worthing? The fact is, dear doctor. I would like to be christened myself. This afternoon, if you have nothing better to do. Surely, Mr. Worthing, you've been christened already. I don't remember anything about it. Of course, I don't know. if the thing would bother you in any way. or if you think that I'm a little too old now. No, no, no. Not at all, not at all. The sprinkling and, indeed, immersion. of adults is a perfectly canonical practice. What hour would you wish the ceremony performed? I might trot round at about six o'clock. if that would suit you. Oh, perfectly, perfectly. Thank you. But we cannot both be christened Ernest. It's absurd. I have a perfect right to be christened if I like. But you've been christened already. Yes, but I haven't been christened for years. But you've been christened. That is the important thing. Quite so. So, I know my constitution can stand it. If you're not quite sure. about your ever having been christened. I must say, I think it rather dangerous. your venturing on it now. Oh, nonsense. You are always talking nonsense. Let us preserve a dignified silence. Certainly. It's the only thing to do now. <i>The western wind is blowing fair</i> <i>Across the dark Aegean Sea</i> <i>And at the secret marble stair</i> <i>My Tyrian galley waits for thee</i> <i>Come down. the purple sail is spread</i> <i>The watchman sleeps within the town</i> This dignified silence seems to have produced. an unpleasant effect. A most distasteful one. <i>O lady mine. come down</i> <i>Come down</i> <i>Dum dum dum dum</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> <i>She will not come. I know her well</i> <i>Of lover's vows. she hath no care</i> <i>And little good a man can tell</i> <i>For one so cruel and so fair</i> <i>True love is but a woman's toy</i> <i>They never know the lover's pain</i> <i>And I who loved as love's a boy</i> <i>Must love in vain. must love in vain</i> <i>Come down</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> <i>Come down</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> We will not be the first to speak. Certainly not. Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends on your reply. Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother? In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you. That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation. Yes, dear, if you can believe him. Well, I don't, but that doesn't affect. the wonderful beauty of his answer. True. In matters of grave importance. style, not sincerity, is the vital thing. Mr. Worthing, what possible explanation. can you offer me for pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an opportunity. of coming up to town to see me as often as possible? Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax? I have the gravest doubts on the subject. but I intend to crush them. Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, espe-- Especially Mr. Worthing's. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it. I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone seemed to inspire absolute credulity. Then you think we should forgive them? Yes. I mean, no. True, there are principles at stake. that one cannot surrender. Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all. -Our Christian names? -ls that all? We're going to be christened this afternoon. For my sake, you're prepared to do this terrible thing? I am. To please me, you're ready to face this fearful ordeal? I am. Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned. men are infinitely beyond us. -We are. -Darling. Darling. -Lady Bracknell. -Gwendolen! What does this mean? Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, Mama. Come here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Of course, you will clearly understand, sir. that all communication between yourself and my daughter. must cease immediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm. I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell. You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algy. Algy? Yes, Aunt Augusta. May I ask if it is in this house. that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides? Oh, no, Bunbury doesn't live here. Bunbury's somewhere else at the present. In fact, um, ahem. Bunbury is dead. -Dead? -Dead. When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must've been extremely sudden. Bunbury died this afternoon. What did he die of? Bunbury? He was quite exploded. Exploded? Mm. Was he the victim of some revolutionary outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested. in social legislation. My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out. The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live. That is what I mean. So Bunbury died. He seems to have had great confidence. in the opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made his up mind. at the last to some definite course of action. and acted under proper medical advice. And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury. may I ask, Mr. Worthing, who is that young person. whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding. in what seems to me to be a peculiarly unnecessary manner? That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. I am engaged to be married. Aunt Augusta. I beg your pardon? Mr. Moncrieff and l are engaged, Lady Bracknell. I do not know whether there's anything. peculiarly exciting about the air. of this particular part of Hertfordshire. but the number of engagements that go on seem to me. to be considerably above the proper average. that statistics have laid down for our guidance. Mr. Worthing. is Miss Cardew at all connected. with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely desire information. Until recently, I was not aware. that there were any families or persons. whose origin was a terminus. Gwendolen, the time approaches for our departure. W have nota momentto lose. As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I'd better ask. if Miss Cardew has any little fortune. Oh, about ¬£130,000 in the funds, that is all. Good-bye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you. A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty thousand pounds? And in the funds? Miss Cardew seems to me to be a most attractive young lady. now that I look at her. Come over here, dear. The chin a little higher, dear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They're worn very high just at present. -Algy? -Yes, Aunt Augusta. There are distinct social possibilities. in Miss Cardew's profile. Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl. in the whole world, and I don't give tuppence. for her social possibilities. Never speak disrespectfully of society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that. Dear child. you know. of course. that Algy has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve of mercenary marriages. Indeed, when I married Lord Bracknell. I had no fortune of any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment. of allowing that to stand in my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent. Thank you, Aunt Augusta. I beg your pardon for interrupting you. Lady Bracknell, but I am Miss Cardew's guardian. She cannot marry without my consent. until she comes of age. and that consent I absolutely decline to give. Upon what grounds, may I ask? I suspect him of being untruthful. Untruthful? My nephew Algy? I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. During my temporary absence in London. on an important question of romance. he obtained admission to my house. by means of the false pretense of being my brother. He then proceeded to win over. the affections of my only ward. when his own intentions, I'm utterly convinced. were purely financial. Deny it if you dare. He subsequently stayed to tea. and devoured every single muffin. and what makes his behavior all the more heartless. is that he was perfectly aware from the start. that I have no brother, that I never had a brother. and that I don't intend to have a brother, not even of any kind. -Uncle Jack, please! -On my word, Jack. Come here, sweet child. How old are you, dear? -Eighteen, Aunt Augusta. -Eighteen. Well, it will not be long before you are of age. and free from the restraints of your guardian. According to the terms of her grandfather's will. she does not come legally of age until she is thirty-five. That does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women. of the very highest birth who have. of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years. Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five? Of course, I could. You know I could. Yes, I felt it instinctively. But I couldn't wait all that time. Then what is to be done, Cecily? I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff. My dear Mr. Worthing. as Miss Cardew states quite positively. that she cannot wait until she is thirty-five-- a remark which I am bound to say. seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature-- I would beg you to reconsider your decision. Dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands. The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen. I will most gladly allow your nephew. to form an alliance with my ward. You must be aware that what you propose is out of the question. Then a passionate celibacy. is all any of us can look forward to. -Oh, but Mama. -Come, dear. We've already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform. Everything is quite ready for the christenings. The christenings, sir? Is not that somewhat premature? But both of these gentlemen have expressed a desire. for immediate baptism. At their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious. Algy, I forbid you to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. I'm sorry to interrupt, Dr. Chasuble. Yes, yes. Miss Prism has asked me to tell you. she's waiting for you in the vestry. Indeed. I believe she's been waiting for some time. Miss Prism in the vestry. Waiting foryou. Yes. Miss Prism? Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism? Yes. madame. I'm-- I'm on my-- -Bless you. -Yes, madame, I'm on my way. to--to--to join her. Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect. remotely connected with education? She is the most cultivated of ladies. and the picture of respectability. It is obviously the same person. Dr. Chasuble, take me to the vestry at once. I've been expecting you. dear doctor. Prism! Prism. Prism! Where is that baby? Thirty-four years ago. Prism. you left Lord Bracknell's house. Number 104. Upper Grosvenor Street. in charge of a perambulator. that contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations. of the metropolitan police. the perambulator was discovered at midnight. standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel. of more than usually revolting sentimentality. But the baby was not there. Prism, where is that baby? Lady Bracknell. I admit with shame that I do not know. The plain facts of the case are these-- on the morning of the day in question-- a day that is forever branded on my memory-- I prepared, as usual. to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious handbag. in which I had intended to place the manuscript. of a work of fiction that I had written. during my few unoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction. for which I never can forgive myself. I deposited the manuscript in the bassinet. and placed the baby in the handbag. .manuscript in the bassinet. and placed the baby in the handbag. But where did you deposit the handbag? Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing. Miss Prism. this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on knowing where you deposited the handbag. that contained that infant. I left it in the cloakroom. of one of the larger railway stations in London. What railway station? Victoria. The Brighton line. I-- Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated. Is this the handbag, Miss Prism? Examine it carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a great inconvenience. being without it all these years. Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this handbag. I was the baby you placed in it. -You? -Yes. Mother! Oh, Mr. Worthing. I am unmarried. Unmarried? I cannot deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has the right. to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly? -Mother, I forgive you! -No, Mr. Worthing! There is some error. There is the lady. who can tell you who you really are. Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive. but would you kindly inform me who I am? You are the son of my poor sister Mrs. Moncrieff. and consequently Algy's younger brother. Algy's younger brother? So. I have a brother after all. Yes. I knew I had a brother! I always said I had a brother. Heh. Cecily, how could you ever have doubted that I had a brother? Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother. How do you do? Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. How do you do? Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother. How do you do? Lady Bracknell, my--my brother. -Algy! -Algy! Oh! Oh! -So? -Oh! Under these strange and unforeseen circumstances. Mr. Moncrieff. you may kiss your Aunt Augusta. John! MISS Mr. Moncrieff. After all that has occurred. and any inconvenience I may have caused you. in your infancy. I feel it is my duty to resign my position in this household. The suggestion is absurd. I won't hear of it. Sir, it is my duty to leave. I have really nothing more to teach dear Cecily. In the very difficult accomplishment. of getting married. I fear my sweet and clever pupil. has far outstripped her teacher. No. A moment. Miss Prism. Dr. Chasuble. I've come to the conclusion. that the primitive church is in error. on certain points on the question of matrimony. Corrupt readings seem to have crept into the text. In consequence. I-- I beg to solicit. the honor of your hand. Frederick. Laetitia. -My dear Cecily. -My dearest Algernon. My own Gwendolen. My own-- But wait! Who are you? I mean, what is your Christian name, Mr. Moncrieff? Now you have become someone else. Good heavens, I'd quite forgotten that point. The question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a moment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the handbag. had I been christened already? Yes, I think you were christened after your father. I see. Then what was my father's Christian name? I cannot at the present moment recall. what the general's name was. I have no doubt he had one. Algy, can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was? My dear fellow, we were hardly on speaking terms. He died when I was only three. His name would appear on the army lists. of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta. The general was essentially a man of peace. except in his domestic life. But no doubt his name would appear. on any military directory. The army lists of the last 40 years are here. These delightful records should have been my constant study. Lieutenants. captains. colonels. -Oh! -colonels. generals. "M." "Maxbohm," "Magley". "Markby," "Migsby," "Mobbs," "Moncrieff." "Lieutenant, 1860. "Christian names." I always told you, Gwendolen. that my name was Ernest, didn't l? Well, it is Ernestafterall. I mean, it naturally is Ernest. Ernest. My own Ernest. I felt from the first that you could have no other name. My nephew. You seem to be displaying signs of triviality. On the contrary, Aunt Augusta. I've now realized for the first time in my life. the vital importance of being earnest. <i>The western wind is blowing fair</i> <i>Across the dark Aegean Sea</i> <i>And at the secret marble stair</i> <i>My Tyrian galley waits for thee</i> <i>Come down. the purple sail is spread</i> <i>The watchman sleeps within the town</i> <i>O leave thy lily-flowered bed</i> <i>O lady mine. come down</i> <i>Come down</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> <i>Come down</i> <i>Lady. come down</i> <i>O lady. come down</i> <i>She will not come.

Algy. you're always talking nonsense. Well. it's better than listening to it. <i>Lady. come down</i> the Year of our Lord *1348* The fumes of the dead hung in the air like poison. A plague more cruel and more pitiless than war had descended upon us. A pestilence that would leave half our kingdom dead. Where did it come from? What carried it's germ? The priests told us it was God's punishment. For what sin? What commandment must we break that would earn this? No, we knew the truth. This was not God's work, but devilry. Or witchcraft. And our task, to hunt down a demon, is God's cure. Brother Thomas. Brother Thomas. Who was taken from us? - Brother Ignatius. Is it the pestilence? - We have not been told. I have no signs. Please brother. Let me out. Averill. O thanks pretty gorgeous. Where've you been? - I was confined .. sacred. I thought you were dead. I'm alright. - I prayed, prayed all the time. I'm alright. I 've brought food. One of our brothers died this morning, Averill. Even the monastery is no longer safe, you must go now. You must go back to Dentwich Forest and you must hide there till this is passed. On Sunday the prior said the pestilence was God's new purge, send to wash away our sins. Is God punishing us? - No. No. You must go now. You must go back to Dentwich. You must go. Osmund, I . - Averill, you'll die. And you will not? Come with me. If I leave the monastery now, I betray God. We've already betrayed him. You know the Martyrs Cross at Dentwich forest? I will wait for you there, every morning at dawn for one week. And then I will be gone. Forgive me, Father. I am confused. I confess, I am torn. Can I serve you outside of these walls? I would leave here, but I would never stray from your grace, father. Show me Your will. Father, give me a sign. I am Ulric, envoy to the bishop. What I say know does not leave these walls. Word has reached the bishop of a village that does not suffer as the rest. They say it is a sanctuary from the pestilence. There are many villages that have not been ravaged yet by the pestilence. It is claimed these villagers are beyond it's icy grasp. Then they are greatly mistaken. These are difficult times. Such claims however fantastical. can find favor with those less educated than you or I. Precisely why we cannot fall foul of rumor and superstition. God's grip on his people is lucent. We must ensure the flock is not tempted to look beyond God and church for answers. I must see for myself how this village is kept safe. What part have we in this? - The village I seek lies in the great marsh. I require a guide, a man of God, to show the way. No man here fit for such a task. With the bishop's blessing I may choose any man here. Out of respect.. I grant you that choice I will lead you there. No, he is a mere novice. This requires a more experienced hand. Let him speak. The said village you seek lies in the great marsh. I was raised close by in Dentwich Forest. I know the area better than any man. He has all the experience I require. You will lead us. We leave at dawn. Osmund, that man is more dangerous than the pestilence itself. Father, I prayed for guidance. God has answered. Even if you survive, the world out there will change you. Perhaps that's what I want Father. My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin, now my lady love has got the blackened skin. My lady love and I, we pour our love so brave, now my lady love rots in an early grave. We have our guide. God has no men left, he sends us a boy. Are you up to it, son? I can lead you there. Pray you do. Split any man from his asshole to his apple. What's that for? How much does he know? Ulric was ahh 'frugal' shall we say with the truth. This village we're headed to. they've cast God aside. In his place sits a demon. There was talk of sacrifice. Of men eating men and of raising the dead. Now we're charged to bring the leader of this village back for confession, trial and execution. The bishop seeks to roast themself a necromancer. - Sorry, what is a necromancer? A necromancer is someone who plucks the dead from the cold earth, breathes new life into them. We have the tools, we have the will. We journey into hell. But God travels with us. - So you misled me. Return to your monastery if you feel betrayed,or join us and do God's work. Let's get this cleared up, let's get going. That includes you, Swire. We are not as bad as you think. But worse. But we need you alive. You seem well suited to keeping men alive. I've spent many a long years in the king's army with Wolfstan and Griff. I'll be honest with ya'. We've faced a demon before, but we take what comes our way. What happened to him? - Ivo was captured. Wouldn't talk, so the bastard French tore out his tongue. And him? - Mold is a men to leave alone. unless there's butchery to be done. And Dalywag, he is a torturer, a hangman, and if the rumor is true, murderer, thief and deceiver of women. But apart from that he's a good man. What about Ulric? - I've got a wife and child. I'm here for the money. Ulric is here, because God told him to come. Burn! - What's it. Have mercy, please have mercy. No! I've done nothing. We must help her. - Do you here me?! You deserve to burn! I've down nothing. - Burn! Burn the witch! Burn! You're in league with the devil. - What is her crime? She brought death to our village. - Death is all around us, and it's no invitation. This does not involve you monk. Step aside. - I have done nothing, please. Please, stand aside. What is this woman accused of? - She poisoned our well in a pact with the devil now. half the village is dead. - I offered a simple blessing over our water to keep everyone safe. Liar. - I did nothing wrong. The dying began after she was seen at the well. - You have her confession? Plenty of us saw her cast her spell. Now she must burn, to spare what remains of our village. Move aside. I will not ask you again. Back. Thank you. Do not stop again. Come on, brown slug. As sure as the sun will rise and fall, witches will burn. There's a village in the north, that burned 128 witches in one night. That's sixteen an hour, for eight hours. By the time that night was through, they'd killed every woman in the village. By the end of that week the men were shagging pigs. Pestilence isn't trial enough, now God has us shagging pigs. This village we seek, you been there? No, but I know where it lies. Hell awaits us, or so we're told. If you've not got the stomach for it, then leave it now. And I'll have your share of the bounty. What is the Church believe this pestilence is come from? I don't believe God is punishing us like many do. I say from France, where all foul things emerge. For once Swire, you might not be too far from the truth. . Three summers passed, we fought a battle at Crecy in Normandy, King Edward's army was dwarfed. For every twenty of us, there were a hundred Frenchmen, at least. The French . Ah, the French. They could sense victory, you could smell it. On that day for the first time our archers used the longbow. Quicker to load, further in flight. Their arrows, their arrows were useless. Couldn't reach us. And ours, ours were like a dark, buzzing cloud. And that day's end, field was littered with their dead and their dying. And custom how matter how fierce the battle, was to use the misericorde. Misericorde, it's the 'mercy-giver'. You stab straight through the armpit directly into the heart. It's quick and painless. But on this day, there was an end to chivalry. King Edward ordered every Frenchman left alive to be killed without mercy. Arms, heads, legs . hacked away. God's greatest army descended into savagery. Forgive me, but how does that conscern the pestilence? We invited Death among us that day. He hasn't left us since. That woman you killed, she was not a witch. Why did you volanteer to join us, monk? To serve God. Killing witches serves God. The woman was already dead. If I had freed her, the mob would have caught her again and burned her. I spared her suffering. Sometimes that is all you can do. He says: 'turn back'. Where we're headed men have become savages. It must've been something pretty special, to tempt you away from that nice, warm monastery. Anything you wanna tell me? - No. You know what my job is? I am a torturer, truth-getter. Spend hours on a man. Can smell a lie, and I smell you. Pray somewhere else, if i were you. Have you broken any vows yet, boy? Leave him be, Mold. Back, get back! Griff! Griff? I said: Get Back! - Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Let me look. Let me look. Just going to take a look. Alright? OK my friend. Just having a look. Why didn't you tell us? I'm sorry. His journey is finished here. I prefer mercy. I need to make a confession to the friar. -No.. cannot be sure how this thing spread. - WHO THE HELL ASKED YOU? I will take your confession. Come, you shall have absolution. YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. Forgive me. Our Father who art in Heaven.. Hallowed be thy name.. Come thy kingdom , forfilled be thine when in heaven as in earth .. bread give us today I need a moment with him. Alright. I 'm glad it's you. I can see things..Urgh .. Farewell my friend. Bury him. The forest of Dentwich. - How far to the marsh? Half a day, perhaps less. Be on your guard. God has slipped over the horizon. You're on watch tonight, Swire. Giving Griff absolution. took courage. Do you truly believe this village can rise the dead? I would not be here otherwise. You doubt it? I believe that hunting necromancers and demons serves men more than it serves god. You have learned much nestled inside the monastery. Demons and necromancers are among us. As you will find out. Soon enough. I'll get some sleep. Averill. Averill. Averill. Averill? No. No, no, no. No. Averill. Wake up! Ulric! Get up! Wolfstan! Ulric, wake up! Wake up! Ulric! How many are in the forrest? How many? - Calm down. What did you see? What did you see? They are in the forrest. I don't. -How many? How many? I don't know. I don't know. How many? -He doesn't know. Mold, forward, now. Wait. Wait. Get in there. NOW! Yah, shut the fuck. No! GOD! GOD! Where is Ivo? You alright? We lost Ivo. Why did you leave the camp? Speak. I came her to meet a woman. - And where is she? She did not survive the forrest. God has punished me for leaving his monastery. God has better things to think of. Because of you. one of my men is dead. If we move, we move now. How do we know the man we've come for is not here? These men are nothing more than common thieves. You will lead us to the great marsh. - Sir, i am of no use to you. You will lead us . or stay here alone and be damned. The village lies beyond the marsh. What's the plan? Identify the heretic . capture him . put him in the cage. That will never go across the marsh. - Then we'll leave it behind! Drag him here. Come on, boy. Come on. What brings you to our village? We seek refuge. A place to rest, nothing more. Then you are welcome. My name is Hob. I am Ulric. You were attacked? In the forest. Then you did well to reach us. That forest can be dangerous. May I ask what you were doing? - Bringing relief to the suffering. Relief? From what? Word of the pestilence has not reached you? Word is all that has reached us. Come. What the hell is going on? We need guile to draw out the necromancer. Noone acts unless I say so. Tonight we'll feed you and give you a bed. And in the morning we'll escort you to a safe part of the forrest. We're not welcome? Of course. But why would you stay? Here is some buckets, you need to wash. This is no time to be blinded by grief. If this is hell can't wait for heaven. You're not bound for heaven, Swire. Believe me. I'll tend to your wounds. I'll tend to your wound. That needs to be dressed. Come with me. - Maybe you should get her seeing to. Where are you from? - From the monastery at Staveley. You're in mourning. Is it so obvious? Was it a woman? It's no sin to love a woman. I have sworn to god. A man needs more than divine love to sustain him. And he shouldn't be punished for wanting it. Do you have a husband? My husband is dead. - I'm sorry. Take off your clothes. I need to dress your wound. The pain is going already. It's extraordinary, the pain is gone. It is a strong remedy. May I ask you, how did your husband die? Men like you killed him. Men like me? Men of God. This church has not seen worship for a long while. The woman you went with . - She dressed my wounds, nothing more. Nothing here is what it seems. You can help us keep warm, girls. Child. I found it. Where? - In the marsh. Every village we rode through had graveyards bursting. No corpse-fueled pits, no burning bodies. We cannot judge them for having no disease. A party was send before us charged with the same task . four men, none returned. They were lead by a man like myself. This symbol is worn only by the bishops envoy. The girl wore its twin. Please welcome our guests. What is ours is now yours. To our guests. 'TO OUR GUESTS' We also want to give thanks that we've been spared the terrible pestilence . sweeping through the land. If I may . I would like to express our gratitude for your welcome. Now let us pray. Pater noster qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. [Our father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.] Adveniat regnum tuum. [Your kingdom come.] Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra . [Thy will be done on earth both in heaven .] Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie. [Give us this day our daily bread.] Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. [And forgive us our debts, we also forgive our debtors.] Amen. - Amen. I expected grace not the entire Lord's Prayer. Women outnumber men here. Maybe that's why a woman speaks for them. Do not be fooled. Evil works within this place, within these people. Osmund. I just need some air. We found her in the forrest. She spoke of you before she died. Forgive me Lord. I am angry. Why did you take her? Why did you take her? Osmund, where were you? Why did you betray me? Why? Why did you betray me? Osmund? Osmund? Osmund. Osmund? What troubles you? - We're to become beasts. We must become more than beasts if we are to triumph here. I see no evil here, just a simple village that has not yet been ravished. Leave a suffering to your heart daunt your senses. Sir, how would you know, you have no heart to suffer. I have known grief. My wife and child sit at God's side. Yes . this village is without the pestilence. But it is also without God. For this they will suffer. Are you shy? I am ugly and I am Christian. And that is not a good combination in here. Hm? Piss off. When will she be buried? Do not worry. I will take care of everything. Can I see her again? You will. You were going to tell me these men mean us harm. Me in particular. I knew the moment I looked into Ulrics eyes. But I did not know with whose side you were on. Come with me. Come. What's going on? Something you should see. Now. What's wrong? Get off. Eat and drink. As a Christian you'll appreciate the concept of betrayal. Together.Keep your head together. Keep it together. - Get lost. Keep it together. - Get lost. Keep your head together. Stop! Piss off! You're not there boy. Look at me boy. Look at me! Come on, boy. Whore! WHORE! These Christians arrived in our village claiming to seek refuge. This was their true purpose. They came uninvited to our home bringing malice and hatred. These are God's gifts to us. These are his words . and these fine men his ambassadors. Thirteen centuries of control and intimidation . now gaze back at us through those bars. We do not relish suffering. We do what we must to keep us safe. The pestilence, the Christian disease, send by your god to ravage his own people. By spilling your Christian blood the pestilence is kept away. You and your flock, you believe that blasphemous filth? Kill us now, you bitch. Get it over with. I will offer you all the chance to live. Renounce your vengeful God, and you will be free. Keep him and you will die. Not one man here will bow down to you. I will die first. - Who wants to live? You? I will fight Ulric for the right to die first. Choose one. You will renounce. I look forward to shagging your mother's ass in hell. My mother is alive and she doesn't relish the company of soldiers. Come on. Come on, men. Die well my friend. - Oh, I will. Come on. My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin.. now my lady love has got the blackened skin. Lady love and I, we pour our love so brave. She says yeah. Now my lady love rots in an early grave. My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin.. Now you will learn about pain. . Nothing you can teach me about pain. Don't look. Don't look. Hey, look away. Look away, boy. Blood of our blood, unholy trinity divine . we offer this lamb slaughtering down . that death not ours shall stay afar. For Christian blood, putrid and sick . into our marsh shall weep. Bitch. You bitch. I'll fucking kill you, you bitch. I'll slice you open. Do you hear me? I'll fucking slice you open. I don't fuck. Choose another. I will renounce. No. No, you won't. You won't. You try to leave this . I'll kill you with my bare fucking hands. I swear, I do. No. Swire, listen to me. If you renounce, you burn in hell. You . - My Friend you'll burn in hell. He's going to kill you. I swear to god, they're going to kill you. Swire, stop, nooo. - I swear to god, they're going to kill you. God, begone. I do renounce thee eternally. God, begone. I do renounce thee eternally. Holy Ghost, begone eternally. Holy Ghost, begone eternally. Christ, begone eternally. Christ . begone eternally. The false idols have been cast out. God is gone. The Holy Ghost is gone. Christ is gone. These men will escort you to the edge of the village. You are free to go. Where are we going? Where are we going? WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHERE ARE WE GO.AAAHHH, NO! Osmund. You will renounce. - Leave the boy. LEAVE THE BOY! Leave the boy and take a man. He's a boy! He's a boy! He's a boy! These monks came to restore our faith. Today he will abandon his own. Inside that cottage is the woman he loves. I 've brought her back to him. - God, I am dead, I'm in hell. No Osmund, you left hell behind when you crossed our marsh. Come live here with us. Come live with the woman you love. We have no fury. We have no pestilence. We have no God. Why are you doing this to me? Because I like you. Renounce, and you will be together. Go. Go. Osmund. Osmund. Do not be tempted. It is not her. IT IS NOT HER! Osmund. Osmund. Averill. No, come here. No, Averill. Averill, look at me. It is alright. It's alright. You're with God. You're with God. And very soon, i'll be with you. I promise you. I promise you. I love you, Averill. In nomine patris . et filii . et spiritus sancti. Amen. Averill is with God. And so am I. This shows how cruel they are. Even the ones they love are slaughtered in God's name. The boy will not renounce. You have no power here. You have no power here. Hob, crucify them all. You can not tear a true man of God away from his faith. I do not fear you, nor your pagan lapdog. Finished? Bring out the horses. Crucify us and you shall be spared. That is the creed of your witch. You came to our land bringing death. For once you speak the truth. We came bringing death. She cannot protect you from God's wrath. Repent! Before it is too late. Hit it. Repent! You will renounce. Never. No! No! Never. Stop! Let me see the boy. You did well. Come on, come on, come. They will all die by God's hand. Open my shirt. Open my shirt. I am Death. Vengeance is mine. God's fury rains down on you. God is restored. Run. Where are you? Hell awaits you with open arms. - There is no hell. Well, heaven doesn't want you. - There is no heaven. Why, why follow her? Because she was beautiful. And real. This . is real. There is no God. Where are you? Where are you? Thou shall not kill . Remember? Remember? Averill was in purgatory. Perhaps in your twisted mind. Did you never think that maybe Averill was never dead? We found her in the forrest, injured but very much alive. You know that is not true. Yes Osmund. Averill was never dead. She was alive. I drugged her. I drugged her. So wh.., why . Why would you do that? Why would you bury her? Because people need miracles. And they worship the miracle makers, whoever they might be. The people in this village believed in me. And so did you. - No, Averill was dead. You killed her. Averill was dead. She was dead. Bring her back. I beg you, bring her back. No, I can't. Pray to your God. See what he can do. She was dead. There is nothing beautiful or uplifting in returning people to God. There is no place in heaven for those who kill. The pestilence claimed no higher purpose. And those who had survived our swords that day soon fell foul of its sighs. They were not protected by the witch. They were simply remote. And once the pestilence crossed their marsh . it killed them too. Osmund. Osmund. We're here. Osmund. That you've returned safe is a miracle. Who is that? - It's a necromancer that I'll be delivering to the bishop. Here, thats . How many of you are left. Enough. Look after him. There's no need. He is back with God. I never saw him again. I heard stories. Dark stories. That in the years that followed Osmunds heart turned cold. That in the shadow of his grief he found a hate. And that in God's name . he took up the sword and vengeance became his creed. Can I help you? Please. Please. I 've done nothing wrong. Please. Please. You have the wrong woman. I want a confession, and i want her alive. Osmund. She won't confess. Are you sure she's a witch? Where is she? Some say he found the witch . and that he tortured her and burned her. Others say it was never her . it was only her guilt he saw in the eyes of the accused. I like to think that he found peace . that he continued seeing beauty in the world . goodness.

Who is it? Antonio Salas. Wait a minute. Gull√≥n! What the hell are you doing here? We can not wait. This demonstrates that Solano had to do with the death of Victor. Pass. What I do with this? It will be good for a story, but as evidence sucks. I do not understand Victor's backpack in the office of Solano. There are more backpacks as well. And if we go there, the pack is no longer. We have the confession of Luis. He dismounted quickly. It was to impress. And how do we catch those sons of bitches? We need a confession. '' No one we did.'' Get data unfamiliar with the press. This is bullshit. To take the ass! With Don Martin Solano. Commissioner Conde. Martin, how are you? I have something that might interest you. But how can be that is useless?

Goin' fast enough, Ed. - You watch them people, Frank. - Shut up, Ed! - What about that safe? - There ain't no safe, Ed. All the money's in the strongbox and in the cash drawers. I don't believe you! You got a safe in here someplace. You tell me where it is, or I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain. - Honest, Mister. - Get out of here, Ed! Are you going crazy, Ed? Watch it, Jesse! Jesse! How long you think it'll take that posse to get here? There won't be one. They'll go about 10 miles and get tired and go back and call the Pinkertons. - How come we're standing guard? - 'Cause every once in a while, I'm wrong. We'll take you upriver to Mimm's house. Get the bullet out there. - You stay quiet, now. - Yeah. Come here, Ed. Jesse! Jesse! - Shit, what'd you do that for? - For panickin' and shootin' innocent folks. Jesse! That's for goddamn getting me near killed! Shit, I didn't mean no harm. You're through, Ed. You ain't gonna ride with me no more. You gonna take that off him? I seen what you done. You may be family and everything, but I ain't sidin' with you. You're on your own. Cole, give him his cut. You threw yourself away a good livin'. Now, listen good. Anybody connects the Jameses or the Youngers with that bank you're a dead man. Hey, now, I saw her first. Step back away. I saw her first. What the hell was that all about? Damned if I know. "And although he may be poor "Not a man shall be a slave "Shoutin' the battle "Cry of freedom" You boys hear what I hear? I hear it. Yeah, better go talk to this fella. I'm out. "From the east and from the west "Shouting the battle cry of freedom "And we'll prove a loyal crew" You've got real nice hands. They're real pretty. You want to keep them? It was just a request. Well, I got a request of my own. <i>I'm a Good Ol' Rebel.</i> "Oh, I'm a good old rebel "Now, that's just what I am "For this fair land of freedom "I do not care a damn "I'm glad I fought against it "I only wish we'd won "And I don't want no pardon "For anything I done" You keep losin', at this rate you'll have to go out and rob another train. And scare some more innocent folk half to death. "I hates the declaration. " - Never liked people standing behind me. - Well, most people would be flattered. Ain't often Belle Shirley stands behind a man. I reckon that's the truth. "I fought it all I could" Are you still asking $15? I sure am. Well, ain't nothing worth that price. Well I don't figure I'll miss much. But I'll tell you what I will do. I'll go $12.50 for you, since you're about to go broke. I only got $11. Cut you for it. Make your move. I'll be go to hell. When your luck changes, you feel free to call on me. Everybody ante up, huh? Women. Love 'em. We's all in the war. Robbed a first Yankee bank 'cause we didn't know no better. It seemed like a good idea at the time. After that, we's just in the habit. So I guess we'll just keep on going till they lock us up or hang us. You've hardly given yourself time enough to heal. I gotta get back to things. Ma needs money to help keep the farm going. I reckon your ma can keep the farm going and a few more things to boot. Well, the others ain't no good without me. They gotta have somebody to make the plans. But don't worry, Zee. I'm coming back for you. Thought you'd be over with that Tebbs girl. Maybe I oughta be. She's awfully pretty, ain't she? If you think so. 'Course, every fellow around here's been to visit her. I don't guess you have that problem, do you, Beth? I have just as many visitors as I want. - And you can count on it. - Like who, for instance? That's for me to know and you to find out. How am I supposed to find out if you won't tell me? Jim Younger, there are some things that a man does not ask a lady. When you're old enough to call yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind. Think maybe you oughta get married. Is that what you want? Seems that you proposed to me during the war about seven years ago. That was different. 'Cept I always knew that you were the one. I just didn't have nothing worked out, that's all. That's a mouthful, Mr. Jesse James. Well, it's a mouthful of truth. Now, what you gotta decide is if you want to get on the horse with me. Now, I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee. I ain't gonna change the way I live. Well it ain't right to try to change a person. Truth is, Jesse, I wouldn't like you any other way. Next thing you know, they'll get married and settle down. First part, anyway. He's asking her today. Doesn't go with the way he's living. He'll be fine. First gettin' shot, then gettin' married. Bad habits. I'd like to have a white dress and a proper weddin'. Sounds like you want the whole county there. I do. A girl only gets married once, you know? I never was the marrying kind myself. Kind of life I lead, women just felt troubled. Footloose and fancy free, that's my style. What about you, friend? I ain't felt the call yet, but if I was to meet a gal as nice and pretty as this one here I expect I could be persuaded. I tell you something, Mister. You best be watching your mouth and not looking at my wife here. Sorry. Didn't mean no disrespect. 'Course he didn't. Just bein' polite. Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while. Vernon, be polite. Goddamn outlaws. Vernon, why don't you just hand that over here? Damn. You son of a bitch, you're in it with 'em. I would toss that shotgun away. Throw down the box. Any of you men fight for the Stars and Bars? Yes, sir. Proud of it. May I shake your hand? Bob Younger. - George. George Arthur. - Who were you with, George? General Joe Shelby. What about you? - I was with Shelby, too. - Where? Coleharbor. Shelby weren't at Coleharbor. You're a goddamned liar. - Should I kill him? - I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch. Bob, I want you to take everything he has. You hear? - Everything. - Let me give you a hand. You're lucky you ain't dead, you son of a bitch. Hope we didn't disturb you too much, ma'am. - Didn't mean you no harm. - You scum! Take your hands off my wife. If you shut up, maybe I won't put a bullet in you. Forgive me for saying so, ma'am but you could've done better than Vernon here. I'll be goddamned and go to hell. "Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds "I know you from old "You robbed my poor pockets "Of silver and gold" - Most people knock. - I expect they do. How many women you visited before you come to see me? This is my first stop. Well, here I am. "I'll bring the blind by way they know not. "I will lead them into paths they have not known. "I will make darkness light before them and. ". I'll make crooked things straight. " Isaiah: 42:16. "Poor drunkard, poor drunkard "How bad I do feel" You and me seem to be gettin' along real good. You might think about makin' an honest woman out of me. - You're serious, aren't you? - Don't I sound it? Well, then you gotta be crazy. Just want to find out what it feels like to be respectable. For a while, anyway. You'll never be respectable, Belle. You're a whore. You'll always be a whore. It's why I like you. Ready? One. Two. Three. - How you been, Beth? - Fine. Ain't you heard the news? I'm engaged to Ed Miller. Ed Miller? He ain't no good. - Besides, you're too young for all that. - I'm 19 on the 23rd of September. I don't want to wait around forever like Zee did. I don't want you saying nothing bad about Ed just 'cause Jesse picked on him. Wasn't but a few months ago I was pushing you in a swing. Well, while you was pushing, other people was noticing. I noticed you, Beth. You don't want to rush into things, Beth. You can't undo 'em later. I can't undo this one. Ed's already bought land over past Russellville. 'Sides, we told everybody. Well, ain't much else to say, I guess. You can wish me a good life. I wish you that. What you got to say for yourself, Jim? Not much, Ed. Be seeing you around. How you been, Ed? Oh, I'm fine. How you doin', Clell? Oh, I'm gettin' on pretty good. This is my girl here. This is Beth Mimms. We're gettin' married. I heard you two took up together. It's good to see you, Beth. I'm doin' real fine, Clell. Don't miss you boys none. Come on, Beth. Let's get to dancing here. You scared? Little bit. I expect I am. Just walk up to 'em real steady, though. We got nothin' to lose. Now you let me do the talking, Bob. You got that? Say, do I look ok? You look fine, Charlie. You Frank James? Who wants to know? Charlie Ford, his little brother Bob. What the hell you boys doin' here? We want to join up. We heard you were lookin' for some new men. Where'd you hear it from? Your brother. There ain't a horse we can't ride, target we can't hit or bank we can't rob. You know how it is. It was there. It seemed easy. Just hauled out our guns and made off with it. Up in Joplin it was. They chased us for two days. You know how it is, being out on the trail and all. We only been out once, but we're willing. What the hell were we talkin' about? Hey, Coleman Younger! Come on over here and say hello. Evenin', ma'am. Looks like everybody's havin' a real good time at this affair. I expect so. Free drinks and food and all. How come I wasn't invited? 'Cause you're a whore. Yeah, well, at least I ain't a cheap one. - See you later, Jess. - See you, Jim. - Bye. - Bye, Zee. Ain't gonna be too long that'll be you and me, eh, Beth? I reckon. How are you? I hear you bought a horse today. I got a question for you. Fire away, Frank. Fire away and fall back. You ever been in love? Oh, God. Yeah. It was terrible. An affliction. Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble. Drove me crazy. That bad? Really? Yeah. She was wonderful. What the hell you aiming to do? I ain't aiming to do nothin'. I'm doing it. - Who are you, Jesse James? - Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger. Jesse James rides with the Youngers. Now stop the damn train. Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen. We're just taking a permanent loan from the Rock Island payroll. Pinkerton Company, in conjunction with the Union Pacific Railroad is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of any member of the James-Younger gang. - Mr. Rixley? - That's right. I'm Carl Reddick. New York Herald sent me out to cover the story of the James-Younger gang. You might say I'm interested in the same thing. What do you think your chances are of bringing 'em in? That's an amazingly stupid question. I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel. - What do you want 'em for? - For robbing banks and trains. Then you Yankees can just turn around and head on back. Sounds like you got the wrong James family. Yes, ma'am, I am a Yankee and a city man. But these men with me here, they're southern. They rode with the Stars and Bars during the struggle. What are they chasing my boys for then? Because they steal, ma'am. I'm afraid I'll have to go in there and look for 'em. This paper here gives me the right to do that. Things have come to a pretty place when a widow woman with a 15-year-old backward baby boy gets treated like this, and they call it legal! I am sorry, ma'am. How come I never been asked? Maybe you ain't cut out for it. We got enough hands the way it is. You keep me in mind. I can rob banks as good as them Millers or your brother Bob. - Ain't nothin' to it. - Think so? Shit, what's to know about robbing a bank? You ride into town like thunder and cannonballs guns blazin', scaring the Jesus out of everyone in sight until they're frozen. Then you ride right in the bank on your horse you dynamite the safe and ride off with the loot. Hootin' and hollerin' same damn way as you came in. That right? Good afternoon. Afternoon. What's the trouble, friend? No trouble. We're looking for the Youngers. You know them? Sure I do. Lot of 'em around these parts. Big family. - Who are you fellas? - Come here to buy cattle. This ain't Texas. What about the Youngers? You're lookin' at two of 'em. And you ain't here to buy cattle. Who are you fellas? Goddamn Pinkertons! - Which Younger are you? - Question is who are you? I told you. - We're cattle buyers. - How dumb you think we are? You're Pinkerton men! I'm Jim Younger. This is my cousin John. You ain't lookin' for him, he don't ride with us. Is that right? I told you he was my cousin. He never rode with us once. Eighteen years old, and I gotta take him back to his family dead. You broke the law. People say they got one of the Youngers. People say they got the wrong Younger. Stand back. All right, now everybody ready. Wait for 'em to come out. God. - What in the hell happened? - I don't know. We put a smoker in the cabin. All of a sudden it blew. The only thing we meant to do was drive 'em out to us. - Now, you're sure it was not a bomb? - No. It wasn't no bomb. The old lady must've thrown the smoker in the fireplace and the kerosene went up. That's the only thing I can figure at. Killing a simple-minded 15-year-old boy. You men did excellent at making heroes out of every one of those gentlemen. Archie Payton Samuel was an innocent boy. It's a sad day when murder is committed in the name of justice. This act tries the forbearance of good Christian men. We commend this child's body to the ground. His soul belongs to the Lord. Beth. Ed. Didn't bring no gun. I ain't got no quarrel with them Pinkertons. I'm sorry about what happened to Archie, but since you boys kicked me out you can just go ahead and fight your own fights. That how you feel about it, Beth? - No, it ain't. - Come on, Beth. - I've had enough talkin' with this fella here. - You go your own way. Now you hold it, woman. You gotta learn to mind me. Hey, Ed start walkin'. Is that what you want, Beth? Then to hell with you. To hell with both of you. Awful sorry about your little brother. Sorry. Mama. Just rest now. We're gonna take you over to Scofield's house directly. I'm sorry, ma. I'm so sorry. You gonna make 'em pay, Jesse? You got it wrong, Mister. We didn't do nothin'. Yes, you did. Some of our friends saw you on the north road that night. Please, Mister. It wasn't really a bomb. It was just supposed to smoke everybody out. My little brother was 15 years old. Now, you think about that on your way to hell. The funeral will be in Chicago, and the governor will be there. I'm sure it'll cheer their souls just to hear you say that. It'd cheer them to know how many men we have out combing those hills. Those boys got a lot of friends out there. What are these two doing here? Visiting. - You got a law against that? - No, ma'am. I got a law against murder, and I got a warrant right here. I don't suppose it'd do me any good to ask polite, would it? It won't do you any good to ask at all. These men of yours are gonna end up dead or they're gonna end up worse. You ladies will be left all alone just to think about it. Mr. Rowe! I want people in the house. I want people in the woods. All right, men, off your horses. Let's go. Morning, boys. Morning, Cole. You boys wasted the best part of the day. Hard to say y'all are farm bred, the way you sleep in. What's for breakfast? Grits. Cracklin' grits. Had 'em yesterday. - I'm sick of this damn hiding out. - Who ain't? Better mind your manners, Bob and thank McCorkindale here. Don't be picking on Bob, Jesse. - Hey, shut up, Jim. - Shut up yourself, Frank. I ain't got nothing but respect for Mr. McCorkindale. You boys just got holdup fever. I know it. All y'all need's a little fresh air. I'll get y'all some milk soon as I feed the chickens. - What about McCorkindale? - He's dead. - You sure? - He's dead. Piss on you! Cover him, damn it! Next volley, we go. Frank's hurt, he goes first. <i>"Jesus, my Lord</i> "To heaven is gone "Where there's no more "Stormy clouds arising "He whom I "Fit my hopes upon "Where there's no more stormy clouds arising "His track I'll see and I'll pursue "Where there's no more. " What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel? My paper would like to get it right. Zerelda Cole Samuel. My husband Robert James died in California. My second husband was called Ruben Samuel. Ruben. And where did you and Mr. Samuel live? Clay County, Missouri. Are you the mother of Jesse James? I am. "His track I'll see "And I'll pursue "Where there's no more stormy clouds arising. " Mrs. Samuel, you've already lost one son. Aren't you afraid your other two boys are gonna end up the same as McCorkindale there? "Where there's no more stormy clouds arising" Ed, you identify the James boys and the Youngers, might mean a reward for you. - How much? - Couple thousand dollars. Shit. I got a question for you. How do I identify what you can't even catch? They are gonna get caught. Jesse and his boys are done with you anyway. Let me tell you one damn thing. I turn 'em in, and I'm gonna get killed by one of their relatives, sure as hell. I got six months to go here for busting up a place drunk so I'm just gonna take my chances, all right? Besides, Jesse just might change his mind and he pays better wages than you do Pinkerton man. Frank, I never saw myself as a farm girl. We ain't gonna be farming, Annie. We're gonna raise horses. I don't know anything about raising horses, either. You know, it's funny. Outside of being a banker about the only thing I ever wanted to do was to raise horses. Thanks to the Pinkertons, you're getting your chance. Ha, mule! And we're not the only ones going our own way. Everybody's doing it. Jim Younger's off in the hills somewhere. God only knows where Jesse is. Bob and Cole are heading for Texas. The only reason why Cole Younger went to Texas is 'cause he heard Belle Shirley got married down there. It's a long way to go looking for trouble. He'll be just fine, Annie. Ha, mule! Yo! Ha, mule! You're late. I'm not much for being on time. You don't look real happy. Well, I'll tell you something about Texas. It's loud. I never figured you for the homesick type. I ain't the homesick type. I ain't the waiting-around type either. I ain't the reliable type. You ought to try getting married. Might improve your character. What do you do with that husband of yours, leave him home, tied to the bed? Don't you make no fun of him. The way I got it figured, you're gonna wear that Indian out. Double-thump side swoop of yours. I do what I want with who I want, and don't make no mistake about it. Everybody says that. They always have. You want to see something, you watch this. Come here. - You done? - Not by a damn sight. Now you're done. Sam. You Cole Younger? Who's asking? Sam Starr. I'm married to that lady. Pleased to meet you. Boys, there is no need to fight over little old me. But if you've got to, you make it man-to-man. Hand-to-hand. Why not? I'm glad I caught you in a good mood. Here you go, both of you. Have a chew. What does the winner get? Nothing you both ain't already had. Don't make much sense, does it? Nope. You're both crazy. But you keep me occupied. I am having a real good time. Ten bucks on the half-breed, right here. Get off of me! Come on, Missouri. What's the matter? You got what you wanted. Sir, we met a few months back. I remember. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions for my newspaper if you don't mind. Like why you're having so much trouble bringing in the James-Younger gang. A lot of reasons. Came down here with four men that didn't know the territory. They were murdered. Most the people around here are related to each other so they're very clannish. What about the local police? Local police get tired and quit after chasing the gang a couple of miles. There are also newspapers like your own that print lies about the gang saying they're Robin Hoods. That doesn't help either. My readers may want to know why you're sitting here next to this warm, friendly fire when you should be out on the chase. Right now the whole bunch of them are spread out across five states. But they will be back. Zee, did you have any visitors while I was gone? Do you mean was there anybody poking around trying to straighten up your sheets and fluff your pillow? I'm just asking. Why don't you just mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James? Just 'cause you're off fighting railroads and banks don't mean you get a free tongue around this house. I sent out a word to the rest. Gonna be meeting up real soon. Going on a mission. I'm gonna get myself a little cash. Start looking around this here state of Missouri for some girl to marry. Any prospects? I'm looking. I don't know, Annie. Maybe we're just going in different directions. Maybe so. Can't help wanting what we want, can we? My going's got nothing to do with big dreams. Nobody ever made you go anywhere you didn't want to go, Frank. Good night. - How you doin', Jim? - I'm doin', okay. So, gents. Let's get down to it. What's our next job gonna be? Minnesota. Them squareheads, they got 'em a real fat bank up there. Scouted it out myself. Northfield. A lot of banks and cat houses in Missouri we ain't done. Cole's right. Minnesota it's a fair piece off our mark. Clell says that bank's full to the brim with money. It sounds good to me. I want Bill Chadwell and Charlie Pitts to go with us. They're goddamn good men. Who says? I do. I used to do this all the time. But I I got married a few years back. I guess it slowed me down a bit. If you know what I mean. Morning, Jess. I hope you boys had a good time last night. How was yours? I got better things to think about. Family man. My family is something you don't talk about, Cole Younger. "Well, I walked the street with a tap to my feet "Heard a voice above me "A maid looked out the window up above needed somebody to love me "My father, he's a minister and virgins he doth cherish "Now she's got five boys, seven little girls and a baby on her shoulder" You know, Frank when this is all over, I think I'll write me a book. Make myself even more famous than I am. If a pig had wings, it would fly. A book about my exploits as a gentleman and a lover. I expect a free copy. Free copy? You gotta pay, Frank. You gotta pay. You ever been up North before? Got to Fetterman once. Went to shoot buffalo. How'd you do? The price of hides went to hell, and I got the clap off some squaw. The bank's plumb in the center of town. Right between the dry goods store and the mortuary. You reckon we ought to send in a couple of scouts? Check it all out? We rob banks, Jim. We don't need any checking. Talking soft I might expect from Cole or Frank. I gave up trying to talk sense to you a long time ago. Come on, let's take the damn bank. There ain't nothin' over there but squareheads anyhow. All right, you people, nobody move. Let's just show God the palms of our hands. Now you don't give us no trouble, Mister. Clell, get to the vault. No, he's not for sale. Just move on, squarehead. Now you open that safe or I'll blow your head right off. I can't, it's a time lock. - What are you talking about? - Time lock, hell. You open that safe, Mister, you hear? The Pinkertons told us you might be coming. The lock is set just for you. It only works at 4:30. The whole town is ready. No, no, mister, please don't shoot. I have a family. Now you got five seconds to open up that vault, mister. What the hell? Get out of here. Be quiet, lady! They're robbing the bank! Jesus, Clell! They're robbing the bank! They're robbing the bank! - Let's get the hell out of here. - Come on, Clell. - Clell, come on! - Yankee bastard. Jim! Bob! Cole! Jesse! Oh, God! Cole! We gotta move, Frank. They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor. Who will? The posse that's gonna be chasing us. We can't do that. We can't just leave 'em here alone. Jim. Cole. We gotta ride. What about the rest? This just ain't no time to argue with you, Cole. Either you stay here and die, or you come with us. Frank and I are going. Kill me. Goddamn it. Kill me. Frank? You're not leaving, are you? I gotta stick with my brother, Cole. The Youngers don't need you. I like it better this way, Jesse. I get to see you run. Jim? Oh, Cole. Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy. We're all here. Goddamned squareheads. Where the hell's Missouri? Come on, Frank. We're gonna get us a new gang together. It's gonna be better than ever. You're not gonna quit on me now. All we got to do is get across the river. All we got to do is get home. We never should have left. You could say we was drove to it. How's that? If it weren't for the war, we might have been something else. You're a little too young to have fought in the war. That's true, but my brothers weren't. And we all go one direction together. You tell me who they are, it might mean a lighter sentence. You think about that. You and I both know it was the James boys, don't we? Sure do feel poorly. Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets must be some kind of record. What do you and your brothers think about a life sentence? You're lucky they don't allow hanging in this state. Come on, Cole. Tell me what you think about all this. Hell, we played a rough game. We lost. I spent four years in the army. Eleven trying to get out of it. What about the James boys? - I don't know nothing about 'em. - Sure you do. Far as I'm concerned, they never been in this state. You another reporter? No. My name is Jacob Rixley. I'm with the Pinkerton agency. I've been chasing you boys for a long time, Bob. Yes, sir, I guess you have. I want to talk to you about the James boys. You don't owe them a thing. You know that, don't you? They wouldn't protect you if it'd get them one day less. But unless you help me you and your brothers are going to be in this jail for life. What's he trying to say? He said to tell you we done it for Dixie and nothin' else. 15,000 for Jesse. Another 10,000 will get you Frank. The Pinkerton company and the governor can't afford that. You know who you're talking to? You know what kind of a man sprung out of Missouri? The Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps. And now Bob and Charlie Ford. Word's out you and Jesse aren't even friends anyway. Is that so? That same Mr. Jesse James you can't find at all just asked us to come and visit him. Let's go, Bob. Wait a minute. $15,000. Half before and half when it's done. Got yourself a deal. No more for me. Heard you were thinking of a bank in Kansas, Jesse. We don't talk business at the table, Bob. Sorry. How'd you boys like a drink? Sounds good. Don't it, Bob? Sure thing. Could I have your plate, please, Jesse? Charlie. - You feelin' all right? - She ain't real fond of the company. Don't worry none, ladies. Just talking some things over, that's all. Can you say, "good night"? He might be carryin' a hideout. I bet he is. He knows. I know he knows. Pour me one, Bob. You look spooked, Charlie. Like hell. Nothing spooks me, Jesse. You know that. Now, I been thinking about the Platte City bank. It's gonna be a big one. We ain't too sure. - Why not? - I don't know. You're a hard man to do business with. It's crooked. What did you say? Said it's not straight. I really like this old sampler. Ma gave this to me for my wedding day. Is that straight? I shot Jesse James. - Mr. Rixley? - That's right. My name is Frank James. I came here to turn myself in. Here's my gun. I want something in return. I want to be able to bury my brother. Suppose I don't agree to your terms? I'll kill you.

It doesn't look like it. - This cannot go on. - I cannot stop the sale of liquor. That liquor den is pure evil. Nothing good comes out of it. - It's your brother. - Aslak! - Has Mathis been here since we left? - He's practically moved in. Mons! - Have you already been to Finland? - Yes. And you're still here drinking? damn, how time flies! Is Elen watching the herd? Your brother has a good wife. You don't even have a girlfriend, Aslak. - At least I have a big herd. - Elen is a good herder. Cheers! Mathis, it's time to go home. Not now. I'm talking to Mons. - Where are the supplies? - There. Behind the counter. - I'm here to pick up our supplies. - They are not on the list. - Can you add them? - No, I am afraid not. Mathis, he won't give us our supplies. Shit! - Now what? - You have to pay your debt. - What debt? - Ruth has made it very clear. You can't go in there! - What are they doing here? - I'll take care of this. - We need our supplies. - Mathis, let me show you my book. Let's see what I have on Mathis. Ten casks. That's 12 specie dollars. Or four adult reindeer. No one can buy more than that on credit. You know the rules. Bring the carcasses tomorrow, and I'll write up your supplies. Get yourself home! I'll get the supplies myself. Stay away from me, boy! Bucht! He's taking his supplies. You damn vagrant! Think you can kick me out? Aslak! Mathis! What's going on here? Huh? They need their supplies. I can pay for them. - Get them. - We don't want his merchandise! We are finished here, and we refuse to pay for his liquor! - What? - She doesn't want to deal with us. - Who's with the herd? - My mother. I'll help you until Mathis is back on his feet. - She doesn't want to pay? - No, not his liquor debt. Mother, we have visitors. Mathis, get up. We have visitors. - Hello. - What is this about? I have to take some reindeer. - What is this? - You are in debt to the merchant. Is this legal? If you do not pay, I, as sheriff, must seize your assets. - That liquor is decimating our herd. - Then stop drinking! Five head? That is because I have to collect. Settle directly with Ruth next time. Mathis, come help us select which ones to slaughter. I'm going too. That's it. Everything is ready. Bucht, we have to find a better solution. Like what? Let me get you the ten casks, and save the reindeer. - Sorry. - He is my brother. He still has to pay his debts like everyone else. Let's get started. Let's go back to the <i>siida.</i> Here's to doing business. No, keep it. - They have cheap goods in Karesuando. - Yes, at the market. Why not buy our supplies there, and sell directly to the <i>siidas?</i> We could make good money doing that. You should go too. They celebrate Mass there. - I want to go! - You stay here with grandmother. - <i>Stubborn bastard!</i> - Now what? Where are you going? damn! - Are you closing? - Everything is closed during Mass. Come to the church. Laestadius is speaking. It is closed during church service hours. Mathis, we are in Karesuando. Everything is closed. We are going to church. Come and warm up. You go ahead. I'll wait here. <i>We have all seen how healthy people</i> <i>turn into pathetic wrecks.</i> Such is the power of the devil's piss! They drink until they drop. Crawl around on all fours, - - as disgusting serpents crawl from their mouths. And their wives and children drag them home like carcasses. And they sell their best animals for liquor. They even steal reindeer for liquor! Under the influence they perform the most repulsive acts. But there is hope, for them as well. It is written in the Holy Scripture. "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost." So take care of your body. God's temple! It is written in the Holy Scripture. "The stranger that is within thee - - shall get up above thee very high." "And thou shalt come down very low." "Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, - - and thou shalt not eat thereof." Is that what you want? do you want to rot like carcass-eating animals? - do you want to rot? - No! Then improve your ways, while there is still time. Stop drinking! Stop fighting. Stop lying. Stop cheating. Stop your loathsome behavior. Improve your ways. You are destroying yourself. Those closest to you. And your descendants. Stand up. Go to those closest to you. Ask for forgiveness. Ask for forgiveness! Mathis! Brother! Brother. Lord, I beseech Thee, give him the strength to confess his sins - - to those nearest to him, and to You. <i>So his soul may be liberated</i> <i>from that which burns inside him.</i> I'll go talk to him. Excuse me, pastor. Could you come to us in Kautokeino? We have to stop the sale of liquor. - Can't your pastor help you? - He is never there. And when he is there, he lives with the liquor merchant. I wish I could help you, but my work calls me further south. You must take matters into your own hands. Read these words. They will awaken the slumbering flame in your hearts. Heaven is within us all. Best of luck. May the Almighty hold His hand over you. Little Aslak! Join me with the herd. Maybe we'll even see some wolves. Hi, Inger. - What is it? - I need help with my herd. - Why? - I am all alone with it. - Where is Rasmus? - He went to town and hasn't returned. - Come here! - Put her on Rasmus' tab! - Come home now, Rasmus. - Let him have some fun. - Stay out of this! - Take it easy, Elen. Have a drink. What the hell is going on? You are the devil's henchman! You are destroying our society! See to it that they pay! Every last one of them! Your debt is now paid. Here's to doing business with you. Stop spreading that poison! "He who drinks will not find peace in his soul." "He is drawn to the liquor like a fly to a cadaver." <i>Laestadius' words</i> <i>struck a chord in our hearts.</i> <i>And little by little</i> <i>people turned to a better life.</i> <i>The general store lost business,</i> <i>as almost everyone stopped drinking.</i> <i>It was a happy time for us all.</i> <i>Everyone wanted to read his writings.</i> <i>And more and more people</i> <i>joined our faith.</i> - Hasn't anyone else been here? - No. We usually have a full house around this time. Has Mathis been here to pick up his supplies? He has been to Karesuando and seen the light. - He has been saved. - It's that damn pastor Laestadius. I'll bet the bitch that tried to burn this place down, was saved too. - She's spreading the word. - What? Elen is spreading the word, to keep people away from here. I have an idea, darling. Why don't you follow the mail back to Alta, spend the summer there? With your family? And I could go to Sweden and find out a little more - - about this Laestadius. - I don't think my cousin can help us. - It's his job. We're losing all our customers. How are we to survive? - And what about our new business? - don't you worry. - It's expensive to build in Alta. - I won't let them stop us. We aren't going to be stuck here. I promised you a good life in Alta. This is but a stopover. You are going to become a lady. It will be the best House of Trade in Alta. That will be your home! I've promised you that, and so it shall be. That's why you have to bring Holmboe here, so we don't lose our income. <i>I remember that summer very well.</i> <i>It was unusually warm.</i> <i>The sun shone night and day,</i> <i>spreading hope of brighter days.</i> I see your summer in Alta has done you well, my darling! - I love you! - Right. Holmboe! Get yourself ashore. I'll take those. Impressive. Much larger than I expected. - But where are the customers? - down by the coast with their herds. - So this is what it looks like. - Hi, Anne-Elise! - Have you been busy this summer? - No, it's just been me and. Not many people have come by. We have mostly been alone. Put the tray down over there. - Attorney Holmboe. - Anne-Elise Blix. Get his room and the bath house ready, while we have a drink. Cheers. "The pastor and sheriff must fear the liquor merchant - - like a wolf that sucks human blood." "They dare not report the liquor merchant for fear of their life." "The liquor merchant threatens to kill anyone who informs on." This is the nonsense he is spreading among his subjects. What am I to do? These are powerful words. Are they the pastor's own? <i>Laestadius originale.</i> I got them in Sweden this summer. "Even officials themselves are led to drink." "They themselves trick the Lapps with liquor." He fills the people with that. Is it any wonder they attack us? He is drying up our market. He has made Swedish authorities ban the trade of alcohol in Lappland. He cannot do that here. This fanaticism is spreading like wildfire! It may already be on its way to the coast. What am I to do, brother? Tell me! Cheers. This runs counter to the teachings of the church. Listen to me. Go to the county governor with this. Persuade him to act. Because this affects me and my family. do this for me, brother. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. I fear for the merchant's safety and well-being. - Sounds like religious infatuation. - With fanatical undertones. They have already carried out physical excesses. This is a matter for the church, not the authorities. - They have no pastor there. - Let us send one. One with power and authority. <i>We are the temple. The church</i> <i>is merely a structure built by man.</i> We won't find care in the church, but in our hearts. That is written in the Scriptures. "discretion shall preserve thee." "Understanding shall keep thee." "To deliver thee from the way of the evil man." What are you doing here? Get thee hence, raven! Pull yourself together! I will have no more of these rituals. The word of God is not to be misused. He is to be worshiped under proper conditions. Who are you? I am your new pastor. What kind of pastor are you, that strikes people? I beg you, dear children, come to the house of God. The church. Where we together can face the light. The light known as Jesus, son of God. The way, the truth, and the life. His gospel spreads a message of great joy. Not through our weak flesh. It is written in this book. The raven is drawn to the House of Evil. - Well? - It is worse than I thought. Confused souls that use the Bible as some sort of fetish. And this is a civilized nation? No, I must get to the parsonage. - You are welcome to stay here. - Supper is served. Mathis! I met the new pastor. He is not a good man. - He hit grandmother. - Who did? The new pastor wants to stop us and help Ruth. He went to the store. Ruth! - What? - We want to talk to the pastor. I'm warning you. Insult him, and I'll kick you out. Why do you attack people during a Christian gathering? According to the church, such meetings are ungodly. - It is my duty to stop them. - Your duty is to help us. - Stop the liquor sales! - I do not have the authority. - But Laestadius did it! - I have to follow Norwegian law. - How do you intend to help us? - By following the word of God. - Then come to our meetings. - Use your ears, not your cane. - did you come here to insult me? - You insult us by beating us. You will respect the pastor. Get out! Stop hitting people! <i>We did not attend church,</i> <i>as the pastor had demanded.</i> <i>He preached to an empty church.</i> <i>And we continued with our meetings.</i> <i>We heard nothing from him</i> <i>that autumn.</i> <i>That winter Aslak and Mons went</i> <i>to Karesuando to purchase supplies.</i> <i>In order to sell them to our people.</i> You won't find a better price than mine in Sweden. - You can count on us. - See you soon again. <i>The new system worked well.</i> <i>We no longer needed Ruth's store.</i> Hello, everyone! Here are your new supplies. - do you have candy? - We have everything! And cheaper than Ruth's. Aslak is riding around selling supplies to the <i>siidas.</i> - To keep people away from here. - Shit! What is it? You have to come with me. You too, Aslak and Mons. - What's going on? - You provoked the pastor. You must come in for questioning. We do not have time now. We have to bring the herd to the plateau. - We have to wait for the herd. - No, they come with us now. - Who are those two? - The pastor's assistants. Come voluntarily, so we can avoid any more trouble. We do not want trouble. Let us hear what the pastor has to say. Keep the herd together until we get back. - If any animals try to stray. - I'll keep an eye on them. We have to keep the herd together! - I am placing you in custody. - Are you arresting me? - I see no other solution. - You have no right! I must be able to perform my duty without fearing for my safety. You, Bucht, are the one who should be in prison! Where are they? We are running out of reindeer moss. I will go look for them. You are no spiritual guide. Instead of helping, you arrest innocent men! do not let him frighten you to silence! does anyone else here wish to challenge the authorities? That man is the devil's helper! From now on I expect to see you all in church, every Sunday. And I will have no more of those fanatical meetings. From now on such activity will be punished. What has happened? The pastor has sent them all to prison, including Mathis. Why have you imprisoned them? - don't bother the pastor. - We need them to move the herds! There, there, my child. Calm down. Come inside. Sit down. do you have something to confess? I'm afraid. I'm afraid of losing our herd. It is all we have. I beg you from my heart. Help us. We are too few. We cannot round up the herd without our men. The herd will spread, become prey to the wolves. I. I also have a flock to tend. It is scattered to the four winds. And I fear for the wolves. day and night. I will not find peace until it is gathered. Help me. Help me to gather my flock. don't you understand? We need our men back now! Today! They are on their way to Alta. And they will stay there until you return to the church. Go back to your people, please. Help me gather my flock. The sooner you choose the Christian path, they sooner they will return. - Get out. - He does not understand. Hey! Hey! What are we doing here? You have no right to keep us here! We have to round up the herd! We are too few! You know that as well as I. - Mother, come! - Quiet! I am so sorry, my child. I will never do that again. Never. I will round up the herd. Everything will be fine. do not worry. <i>You can become so distressed that you</i> <i>get angry, even at your own child.</i> <i>We did not know what to do.</i> <i>The pastor held our men because he</i> <i>thought we refused to attend church.</i> <i>But we did not have time</i> <i>to attend church.</i> <i>We had to round up our herds.</i> <i>I found some on the mountain plateau,</i> <i>but they are difficult to move alone.</i> Go away! Go away! "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me." "He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." "He hath sent me to preach deliverance to the captives." "And recovering of sight to the blind." "To set at liberty them that are bruised." "To preach the acceptable year of the Lord." Such are the words of our Lord. Sit down. You too. Sit down. I need help. You had our men arrested. You can set them free. Respect the church! I am begging you for help, in the name of God. If you do not respect the word of God, I must ask you to leave. The Bible says God does not live in buildings of wood and stone. Who are you to blaspheme God during a holy church service? - Are you of the devil? - You are the devil's pastor! - You do the opposite of the Bible. - Enough! This service is over. I am sorry. You'll pay for this! But you refuse to understand! Stockfleth has arrested our men in the middle of the migration. We tried to hold our herds together, but failed. We cannot keep them together. We need help to round them up, and to free our men. They cannot stay in prison without being sentenced, can they? - No. - Then have them released! Elen, I shall see to it that they are released. Help her round up the herd. Who can help her today? Go to the north side of Golggotvuopmi. No one can be held in prison - - without being convicted of a crime. There is no formal charge here. I therefore insist that you have the men released immediately. If not, I shall go directly to county governor Harris. The law here is crystal clear. Perhaps I have been blinded by my zeal. - I'll see what I can do. - Good. Thank you, pastor. The sheriff is clearly afflicted with the same madness. Let's go to Alta. We must act swiftly. The animals will be well off here. This is a good grazing area. They will settle down here. - Where is father? - He will come. I have called you here to make the following announcement: Ole Isaksen H√¶tta has been removed as sheriff, effective immediately. The new sheriff in his stead will be Lars Johan Bucht. This is the authorities' decision. Please respect it. What about the prisoners? The prisoners' fate is in your own hands. They will be released as soon as conditions here become civilized. What is going on here? The authorities have made their decision. did you tell them the truth? Of course. Are you accusing me of lying? How could you otherwise have removed the sheriff? - What are you saying? - The sheriff must be reinstated! Our men must be set free! do it, or we will contact the county governor! You have no authority to submit such a claim. For the last time: Respect the authorities' decision! Let us gather in the schoolroom. Make sure the bishop gets this as soon as possible. Godspeed. The bishop will help us. Welcome! It is a great honor to have you visit us out here in the wilderness. - Thank you for inviting me. - Welcome, bishop. Let us go inside the schoolroom. It is warm and nice in there. ".that whosoever - - believeth in him should not - - perish, but have everlasting life." - Thank you, Anne. - Well done! Thank you. That was the last one. Excuse me, may I ask the bishop a question? Yes? Is it legal to arrest innocent people? I apologize, bishop Juell, I didn't know you had arrived. Hello, Stockfleth. I am amazed at your congregation's knowledge level. Even the youngest can read. The diminished drinking and improved reading skills are an inspiration. I feel placed in a different world. Your genuine longing for God touches me deeply. May I invite you to a small meal? Thank you, Stockfleth. They have been imprisoned without being charged. There will have to be legal consequences. What do you mean? If they are acquitted, someone will have to be held responsible. As I see it. It is important the church not take sides in a secular conflict. We must recreate a level of trust between church and congregation. I think perhaps the bishop - - has been lured into viewing these believers in too positive a light. - Perhaps? - I agree, Mr. Ruth. Bishop, I have seen first-hand how this movement has grown. As you well know, such movements are most harmful. Not just to the church, but to the congregation itself. Let us remember why I came here. I promise that your men soon will stand trial. They will be treated like any other citizen. So please respect the decision of the court, whatever it may be. It is important for us to look ahead. To together recreate a bond between you and the church. So I have decided to find a new man of the cloth. Who will find the light and warmth we are all searching for, with you. Stockfleth will therefore be replaced by a new pastor. That went well! <i>Those who imprisoned our men</i> <i>without convicting them,</i> - - <i>could now themselves be convicted.</i> <i>So this trial was important.</i> <i>Not in order to have us convicted,</i> - - <i>but so they themselves</i> <i>could avoid being convicted.</i> <i>Things are not always</i> <i>as they appear to be.</i> <i>Remember that.</i> This court is in session. Bring in defendant number one. Is it true that you attacked the pastor? It was not an attack. It was merely a heated discussion. How did you experience the situation? I was assaulted. He grabbed me by the throat. Threatened me. - And you witnessed this act? - Yes. It was a shocking sight. The pastor was attacked like a. That isn't true! They are lying. Mathis didn't do that. Elen Skum? You are wanted for questioning. Come. With an unbridled rudeness I had never seen the likes of, - - she interrupted a holy church service. And with an exalted voice, she yelled out at me. And called me a devil. do you admit to calling the pastor a devil? - I came to ask for help. - Everyone here witnessed her actions. She interrupted the service and called the pastor a devil. don't you understand? I needed help! He refused to talk to me. - Order in the court! - The defendant may be escorted out. Sentencing is in one hour. This court is adjourned. Prosecutor Holmboe has issued the following sentences: Aslak Jacobsen H√¶tta is sentenced to prison - - for fifteen, 15, days. Rasmus Spein is sentenced to fifteen, 15, days. Mons Aslaksen Somby is sentenced to fifteen, 15, days. Mathis Jacobsen H√¶tta, for attacking a senior civil servant, - - is sentenced to eight months hard labor. Order in the court! Be quiet out there! Elen Skum, for having interrupted a church service - - and for inciting rebellion, - - is sentenced to hard labor for one year and six months. The prisoners shall be transported immediately. Where will I be sent? You will be held in Alta until you are transferred. Who will take care of my child? - Who can take him? - His grandmother. In the <i>siida.</i> Let her bring her child to his grandmother. Bucht, escort her. She must return today. Let's go to grandmother. When will you be back? First there will be one summer, then one winter. Then summer again, and then I will return the next winter. Your father will be back well before that. You'll do fine with the herd. Come on! Let's go! Goodbye, my dear. Give my best to the others. Mother will be back. Sit down in the middle one! Mother! - do not leave me! - It's all right, my boy. Stop! damn! - Find some reindeer! - The herd is miles from here. - We lost the <i>raide!</i> - Now they cannot follow our trail. Take my jacket. Are you cold? We found these on the other side of the plateau. No trace of them. Get help. Find her. damn! don't worry. We are almost at the sod hut. Here it is. I'll get us inside. Bucht, we can't find her. They are hiding her until Aslak is released. Then they will fight to have you convicted instead. Shit! Aslak, take care of my wife and child. I promise. - Finally! - Where is Little Aslak? - With his mother. - Where is she? - Elen escaped. - Escaped? To the sod hut. - How is the herd? - It is in one place. - I have come for Elen. Where is she? - We just got here. It's illegal to hide a fugitive. Where is she? She just disappeared. If she doesn't turn herself in, the sheriff will take action. He will never find her, even with a hundred men. Give this to Elen immediately. It's up to you. If she doesn't come, she'll suffer the consequences. - What is this? - The court costs. They can take them in reindeer. I have to talk to Elen. He wants to slaughter our herd. As payment for the court costs. I thought they were going to treat everyone equally. That someone would understand. We will help you. It is no use, Aslak. They are too many, we are too few. Come to the <i>siida</i> tomorrow. We will protect you and your herd. do not worry, Elen. Tomorrow we will round up the largest herd ever seen before. Good idea! Let's get old L√°rros herd too! They are joining the herds. They already have over 1000 head. The bigger the herd, the harder it is to find Elen's reindeer. - How many head can they end up with? - Over 3000. We'll never find hers. Take her animals, before it's too late. - You have to come! Fast! - What is it? They're taking our reindeer. That's her earmark. - What are you doing? - We were sent to take your herd. - Not until Mathis is back! - All convicts must pay court fees. You're going to the sheriff. - Mother! - Help! Help me! Let go of my daughter, scoundrels! Help Elen! - What the hell? - Help them! When Bucht hears about this, Aslak, you're dead! He's going to demand the same from all the convicts, including you! We have to do something! Or we will lose everything we own. We must go to Kautokeino. Stay here with grandmother. What's going on? Tie them up! All of them! You're all going to prison! <i>It hurts to think that it would be</i> <i>17 years before I saw you again.</i> <i>I thought about you</i> <i>every day I sat in prison.</i> <i>I know that it got quiet.</i> <i>That no one wanted</i> <i>to talk about what had happened.</i> <i>There are certain things</i> <i>that are difficult to talk about.</i> <i>But silence advances nothing.</i> <i>We must speak.</i> <i>Try to understand.</i> <i>Even when</i> <i>all hope appears to be lost.</i> About face! The leaders behind this misdeed were the two miserable wretches - - that today shall die by the executioner's blade. As testimony to the fact that God will not be blasphemed. Let us through daily repentance and our faith in Christ - - prepare for the sinister hour when we also shall come before His throne. Let us pray with each other and for each other. And let us at this solemn time ask our Father in heaven - - to have mercy upon our two wretched brethren. And ask that they at this time acknowledge and repent of their sins. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. do you repent of your sins with all your heart, - - particularly the misdeed for which you now shall die? No. Shall I grant you absolution, before you face eternity? That will not be necessary. Lord Jesus, answer me. Why am I unable to repent? As you prepare to face our all-knowing judge, - - do you repent the misdeed for which you now shall die? I want to repent. But I am unable. Are you, in the name of the Lord, prepared to die for your sins? I do not know if the Lord cares if I am prepared or not. By the power vested in me, - - shall I grant you absolution, before you face eternity? No. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. <i>They left us,</i> <i>but their hope never faded.</i> <i>Hope never dies.</i> <i>It spreads to new hearts.</i> <i>New generations.</i> <i>Like a spring wind</i> <i>brings tidings of a warm summer.</i> They lost their lives.

How much is the milk? Forty-nine pence. Thank you. Thank you. Too much. Much too much butter. - I like butter. Milk¬ís gone up. 49p a pint. Good grief! We¬íll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. Or take in paying guests! Watch out. She¬ís on the prowl. Eat your egg. Goodness! There you are. Yes. Here we are. I don¬ít understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It¬ís very very important - Please just make it really clear. Who¬ís on after you? xxx? Beautiful day. Oh, you¬íve made a start. Carol¬ís coming soon, I¬íll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I¬íll bring up a suitcase for it. No no no no. The grey. You sure? Yes. .Definitely the grey. Righty ho. Boss knows best. Don¬ít let her take my paper away. Oh, I haven¬ít had a chance to look at that yet, dear. Sorry. Atta-girl. Damn. Blot it. Blot it.. pardon. Now look what you¬íve done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in? I¬íll be off then. Wear your scarf. There¬ís a chill out there. Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright? How are you feeling? I¬ím fine, thank you Susie. I¬íve just been reading about the bombings. Yes. Frightful. Sorry. These are the books for you to sign. I brought as many as I could find. Shall we go through your appointments? We said we¬íd go through them today. Yes, of course, dear. Today. The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I¬íll put it on the mantelpiece, and there¬ís an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month. I said no because you¬íve got a concert that afternoon but if you¬íd like to. It looks like a very interesting programme. What are they playing? I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein. Silly man. He hasn¬ít got his scarf on. Did someone cover the butter? I¬íll go. Leave it. Margaret- Good girl. Tomorrow, no matter what they do, it¬íll be business as usual. Two of the small beef, Mr. Roberts. What is the life blood of any community? It¬ís business. Not just big business but small businesses, like mine. Margaret! CUPS! We on this island are strong. We¬íre self-reliant. Sometimes we¬íre plain bloody minded. But we also believe in helping each other. And I don¬ít mean by state hand-outs. Margaret, do you want to come to the pictures? She can¬ít come, she¬ís got to study. Miss Hoity Toity! Never run with the crowd, Margaret. Go your own way. xxxOpen it then. I¬íve got a place at Oxford. Don¬ít let me down Margaret. Mother? My hands are still damp. Margaret! CUPS! They¬íre talking about you again. What time is it? Sun¬ís not quite over the yard arm. Time for tea. What have you got on your head? Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it¬ís Friday, why not fancy dress? You look ridiculous. Bosslady no like? No, Denis, Bosslady no like. Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car. xxx Well then take the sticker off! I call that false advertising! xxx - I would say keep the change. but there isn¬ít any change. Hello June, any news? I¬íve brought every bag I could find. xxx Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver. Wouldn¬ít take my card. I said don¬ít have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash. Can you believe it? I was rummaging around the bottom of my bag. He didn¬ít get a tip. I didn¬ít know that you were dropping by today, dear. Yes, you said yesterday. You wanted to make a start on Dad¬ís things. The cupboards? Then I can help you dress. You¬íve got Michael and- Jaqueline. Coming for dinner tonight. Of course. We¬íre having halibut. Oh God. Isn¬ít it terrible? They think it¬ís Al Quaida - xxx It¬íll be fine. Come on, get your head down, it¬ís ten to three, for God¬ís sake. At ten to three this morning an explosion. extensively damaged the Grand Hotel in Brighton scene of the Conservative Party conference. Where the Prime Minister and a number of her cabinet were staying. They escaped unhurt - Five people have died, many others are injured, some critically. The IRA have claimed responsibility. We must release a statement, offering our condolences. I¬ím sure they¬íve already- We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists. Good moring dear. Now ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight? Oh, below the knee I should think. No! Don¬ít move those. I haven¬ít finished sorting them. I hear you went out today. You mustn¬ít go out on your own Mummy. We¬íve talked about that. There was no milk. Call Robert he¬íll get it for you if June¬ís not up- I am not for the knackers yet. Now take it easy, Margaret. No one is saying that. If I can¬ít go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to. Really Carol. please don¬ít fuss about it. You¬íve always been like this, fuss fuss fuss. You must find something better to do with your time. It¬ís most unattractive in a woman. When I was your age. the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother. Four down, 9 letters. Something b something t something n. something something somthing. Refusal to change course- Obstinate. What? Pearls. I¬íll wear the pearls. There they are. My little twins. Thank you, dear. It¬ís nearly all familiar faces, William, Michael and his lovely wife- Jacqueline. And then there¬ís Peter, James R and James T and that very nice man- Yes- we met last year. Yes I remember- I think he¬ís bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit. We¬íre rather short on women - but I¬ím sure we¬íll manage- I¬íve always preferred the company of men- Ma? Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be chosen as our candidate for parliament. Well I don¬ít like coalitions, never have. Start on the outside and work your way in. Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words. They¬íll be nationalizing the bloody air next. Yes, hold your breath, sir, that¬ís government property! So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts? Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of Grantham. And a grocer as well! Yes. And did you help, in the. shop? - Oh, yes. It was a family business. A very good starting point for the political life, I¬ím sure. That and a degree from Oxford. Whisky. What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do. they must just get up and do. And if something¬ís wrong, they shouldn¬ít just whine about it. they should get in there and DO something about it, change things. With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham- Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too. Really? I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income. Just like the man or woman on the street, when I am short one week. I have to make economies the next. Nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility. A man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping. I¬ím not sure. a home economics lesson is quite what. the Dartford constituents need. They see industry being nationalized. the unions on the up, the pound on the slide. whoever can sort that lot out, he¬ís my man. Or woman? Ladies shall we? Miss Roberts, do join the ladies. Well. That¬ís told us! So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you¬íd been Prime Minister? Where? The bombings, mummy. Today? We were just talking about them? No, uhm, yes - we have always lived alongside evil. But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion. xxxSo, would you - Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age. Unimaginable! The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought. Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie. xxxYou don¬ít mind if I sit down. I heard you speak at conference in Brighton in 1984 just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself. It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone. Well anyway, I. thank you. Good night, Lady Th. - Good night to you. OK. hold on to me. Can you do the clasp, I can¬ít quite - Thank you. You¬íve got an eyelash. Make a wish. I spoke to Doctor Michael today- He is very good and very expensive- .I know you¬íre not due to see him for another month but I¬íve spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow. Just for a check up. Ma please- What does Mark think about it? Mark? Yes. Tell him to come up. I want to talk to him about it. Mark¬ís with Sarah and the children. Well tell him to come up and see me after he¬ís. kissed them good night, would you Carol darling? He¬ís not here Mummy. Mark lives in South Africa. you are not Prime Minister anymore. and Dad is. Dad is dead- You look exhausted, dear. You really must try to get some sleep. Taxis'll be few and far between at this hour. Righty-ho. Night night Ma. Sleep well. Good night, dear. Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association. Winning candidate Mr Dodds had better watch out, this bright young woman is on his tail. Eat! Disaster. Hang on. Hang on. xxx You shaved thousands off their majority. You did splendidly. Not splendidly enough. Ah I see. Self pity. No one is saying you don¬ít need a safe seat. You deserve a safe seat. But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little. What game? You are a grocer¬ís daughter- And proud of being. - in their eyes. A single grocer¬ís daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman- You¬íd get to parliament, and I¬íd get to be the happiest man in. in wherever they select you. Margaret, will you marry me? Well? Yes. Yes! What? I love you so much but. I will never be one of those women Denis- who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter. We¬íll get a help for that. - No. one¬ís life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one¬ís life must mean more than that- I cannot die washing up a tea cup. I mean it Denis, say you understand. That¬ís why I want to marry you, my dear. Now eat. There they are, my little twins. Cornwall, wasn¬ít it? Bloody hell. Look at ¬ëem, little imps. You never really got golf, did you? You look happy. Yes, I do, don¬ít I? You¬íre drinking too much. Whatcha doing? Not like you. Looking back. Don¬ít want to dig around too deep, M. Don¬ít know what you might find. You can rewind it, but you can¬ít change it. They grow up so fast. Mr Eric Deakins, Labour. 13,437. Mr xxxx lib. 12,260 Mrs Marg.. Thatcher con. 29,697 xxx Mrs Marg.. Thatcher. xxx. Please. xxx Mrs Thatcher! Mrs Thatcher! Airey Neave. Welcome to the madhouse. Follow me. Welcome. xxx Order The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education. The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools! Because. his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy. Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating, no lighting in their classrooms. And I ask the honourable gentleman, whose fault is that? Me thinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down! If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to. What I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself! Why has this Conservative government failed? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs? Minister. the breakdown of essential public services in transport, electricity. sanitation is not the fault of the trades unions. but of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve! So these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise. The miners are asking for a 35 % increase in wages. Obviously we can¬ít go anywhere near that. The unions are not our enemies and never have been. We want- and have always wanted the broadest consensus I¬ím sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing. for the moment that will further inflame the current situation. Hear hear, Prime Minister. - the fact of the matter is, it¬ís absolutely crucial. that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators. and not aggressors. - Yes. Yes, Education Secretary. Yes, Prime Minister. With the Miners¬í leader calling today for the army to mutiny. in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation. Be patient. They¬íll come back on in a minute. xxx Thank you, Margaret. Your thoughts are duly noted. We on this island are strong. We¬íre self-reliant. Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers. He meant it as an insult but to me it¬ís a compliment. That¬ís why he couldn¬ít beat us, and that¬ís why Hitler can¬ít beat us. We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to. fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There¬ís no good in pretending we¬íre all equal. we¬íre not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have. for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow. It¬ís 1974 and you¬íd think it was WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It¬ís a mess. Heath should resign now and make way for someone who¬ís not afraid to tackle the unions. I swear, it¬ís all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I¬íve hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn¬ít it? Maybe third time lucky. Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. One must be brave if one is to take the wheel- Right-o. Move over. Move to your right a little bit. But if I move to the right aren¬ít I on the wrong side of the road? Well he¬ís in the way! - To the right. Move to the right! So sorry! Terribly sorry! Hey, look at me, driving! Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I really feel I¬íve got a handle on it now. You should have seen us, Pa. Have you been trying to make breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis! I can boil a bloody egg. Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere. All over the place - I¬íve decided. I¬ím going to run. What for? I¬ím going to run for Leader of the Party. Silly me! - Good luck! All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change! What¬ís she on about? It¬ís her driving test this morning! - Oh, right. Of course. Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister? What I¬ím saying is that someone must force the point, say the unsayable. None of these men have the guts. The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT. But he¬ís weak, and he¬ís weakened the party. One must know when to go. You¬íre shaking. Let. xxx - I can do it! Goodness me! What is the matter with everyone this morning? I¬íve told you what the matter is. The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest. And do you need a rest? We both know. that it¬ís highly unlikely that I would ever be elected leader, But I will run. I will run. Just to nip at their heels and make. them reaffirm the principles on which the Conservative Party must stand. There¬ís so much to do. You¬íre insufferable, Margaret, do you know that? Denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that. And it is my duty. - Don¬ít call it duty. It¬ís ambition which has got you this far. Ambition. And the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to hell! Don¬ít worry about me, I¬íll be fine! Where did you go? South Africa. - Yes.Yes. How many days passed before you realized I was gone? Probably had to ask the cleaning woman where I was. When did I lose track of everyone? Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT. Mrs Thatcher I understand you recently visited the United States of America. What was it you took away from that visit which may be of value here in Great Britain? Oh that¬ís rather easy to answer, actually. They are unafraid of success. We in Great Britain and in Europe are formed mainly by our history. They on the other hand are formed by their philosophy. Not by what has been, but by what can be. Oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes. Oh yes! For a start, that hat has got to go. And the pearls. In fact I think all hats may have to go. You look and sound like. a privileged Conservative wife and we¬íve already got her vote. You¬íve got lovely hair. but we need to do something with it to make it more, Important. Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority. Me thinks the Lady doth screech too much People don¬ít want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That ¬ëoh yes¬í. at the end of the interview, that¬ís authoritative, that¬ís the voice of a leader. It¬ís all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader. would be like imagining, I don¬ít know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It¬ís my background, and my sex. No matter how I¬íve tried, and I have tried. to fit in, xxx I will never be truly one of them. If I may say so - I think that¬ís your trump card. You¬íre flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It¬ís really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal. bring out all your qualities. and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be. You¬íve got it in you to go the whole distance. Absolutely. Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don¬ít expect to win the leadership, but I. am going to run. Just to shake up the party. Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we¬íre talking about here today is surface. What¬ís crucial. is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself. Leave us to do the rest. Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins. and they are absolutely non-negotiable. Good, I think we can loose the handbag, Mrs Thatcher. Hands down the sides. And. bring it down. Because this isn¬ít really about the voice, it¬ís about belief. A nice deep breath. xxx hands If you¬íre calling Mr Thatcher, how would you do that? Denis. Yes, I want more authority, I want conviction, I want. That¬ís right, one more time, deep breath - Denis. Yes MT! You are the backbone of our nation! Small firms like Loveday¬ís Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to meet you ladies. I¬íll just have a small one, because I¬ím watching my figure. That¬ís for you young man! I passionately believe it¬ís the growth of small businesses into larger ones. that is critical for Britain¬ís future. It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis. That¬ís the only way. we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that sustain. The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them. It stops them from working. It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees. I say enough. It¬ís time to get up. It¬ís time to go to work. It¬ís time to put the Great back into Great Britain! xxx Give ¬ëem hell! You look magnificent. Next stop Prime Minister. Let go. The leader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher! Good night Margaret. My money¬ís on the filly to win! Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight. No. No, no! Airey! The Irish National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the. death of Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher¬ís spokesman on Northern Ireland. <i>If you want to change the party, lead it.</i> <i>If you want to change the country, lead it.</i> <i>You¬íve got it in you to go the whole distance!</i> Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help. That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love. And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win! xxx It¬ís Friday the 4th of May, an historic day for Britain, a Conservative government led by Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead - Mrs Ghandi in India, but never in the West has there been a woman Prime Minister. The place that she has secured in British history, as. the first woman ever to be invited to form a government. The bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world, Number 10 Downing Street. This is it, steady the buffs old girl. Good afternoon, Prime Minister. I should just like to say. that I take very seriously the trust. the British people placed in me today. and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer. of St Francis of Assisi: "Where there is discord may we bring harmony. Where there is error may we bring truth. Where there is doubt may we bring faith. Where there is despair may we bring hope" Shoulders back, tummies in! Oh. Thank you, Michael. Two, one. I¬ím perfectly healthy. There¬ís no need for any of this. Just let them look under the bonnet, MT. Check everything is hunky dory. Really it¬ís becoming quite tiresome. What is? - You. I was on my own for twenty four years. before I met you and I can manage perfectly well without you now. So will you please go away and stop bothering me. Just look straight at me, straight ahead, that¬ís it. Are you noticing night sweats? - No. Hallucinations? No. Sleep? Yes, I sleep. Four, five hours a night. So you wake early? And I stay up late. I always have. We just want to keep abreast of it thats all. Yes. Of course. Grief is a very natural state. My husband has been gone for years. Cancer. Carol says you¬íve decided to let his things go. Probably a good thing. Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam. Perfectly good stuff. People can use these things. Still it must be a bit disorientating. You are bound to be feeling. What? What am I ¬ëbound to be feeling¬í? People don¬ít ¬ëthink¬í any more. They ¬ëfeel¬í. ¬ëHow are you feeling?¬í ¬ëOh I don¬ít feel comfortable with that¬í ¬ëOh, I¬ím so sorry but we, the group were feeling.¬í D¬íyou know, one of the great problems of our age. is that we are governed by people who care. more about feelings than thoughts and ideas. Now thoughts and ideas. That interests me. Ask me what I am thinking- What are you thinking, Margaret? Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think, we become. My father always said that. And I think I am fine. But I do so appreciate your kind concern. Oh, do please answer that. It might be someone who needs you. I¬íll give Carol a quick ring, let her. know we¬íre back, then I¬íll put your electric blanket on. Steady, steady, steady! Damn. Fore! What about that medicine man, eh? Ah. Cold supper. Standards are slipping Margaret. Well you really gave it to that quack didn¬ít you, darling? Just like the old days! Hallucinations my eye! How dare he? But then you give us all the run around, don¬ít you? I know you can hear me, sweetheart, so there¬ís no use pretending you can¬ít. Enough. Denis, enough! Dismissed! She does it in the end. Kills him- I don¬ít know why you¬íre being so scratchy. It¬ís not as if you¬íve got anyone else to talk to. When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride - You know, it¬ís a marvel to me that you can still quote huge chunks of Kipling. but try remembering the name of that woman who¬ís. just made you that godawful cold collation. No? Come on. You can do it. Month of the year. One syllable. Rhymes with moon. June. - June! Bingo. Knew you¬íd get there in the end. ¬ìWhen the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride. He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside. but the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail. For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.¬î If I can¬ít hear you then I can¬ít see you. And if I can¬ít see you then you are not here. And if you are not here, I am not going mad. I will not go mad. I will not. I will not go mad. Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her doctor today. Although rarely seen in public, the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century, remains a controversial figure. Almost lovingly dubbed by the Soviets The Iron Lady, she¬ís also credited, with her friend Ronald Reagan, with a decisive role in the ending of the Cold War. Her supporters claim she transformed the British. economy and reversed the country¬ís post-war decline. Her detractors blame her savage public spending. cuts and sweeping privatization of - I don¬ít recognize myself. Am I out of the doghouse yet? They¬íre unveiling that portrait. of me at Number 10 next month. The invitation¬ís on the mantelpiece. So. there¬íll be Churchill, Lloyd George and me. Just the three of us. I said I didn¬ít want any big fuss but they insisted. Lovely little article in The Telegraph. The Woman Who Changed the Face of History. Less than two years ago, the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis. and talked about bringing faith, hope and harmony to this country. Denis? Can the Right Honourable Lady deny, that having brought about the highest level. of unemployment since 1934- The biggest fall in total output. in steel and coal production in one year since 1931. And the biggest collapse in industrial production since 1921. Order, Order. Can she also accept that her free market economics. designed to create a growing middle class. ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant! Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out! Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out! You¬íre supposed to be a mother! You¬íre not a mother, you¬íre a monster! May we have a word, Prime Minister? Yes, but in order to arrive at the palace on time, Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that door in 15 minutes. As you can see. - I know you¬íre running late Margaret. but we have to address this situation in light. of tomorrow¬ís blistering press coverage. Blistering! The knives are out. Your draft budget¬ís been leaked, Geoffrey, they are baying for our blood! Michael we can¬ít possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty. No one is saying we have to buckle. - But is this really the time to. make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest. recessions this country has ever experienced? We need a plan of action, Margaret. - Absolutely. A strategy. We must be armed. There¬ís a perception, Margaret. rightly or wrongly, that we are now completely out of touch with the country. Really. How much is a pack of Lurpak? Lurpak? - Butter, Francis. Forty two pence. Anchor butter is forty pence. Flora margarine, still the cheapest, is thirty eight pence. I can assure you I am not out of touch. ¬ìGrocer¬ís Daughter¬î What - did you say? Nothing. Prime Minister, Nothing. No, no, please. Don¬ít try to hide you opinions. Goodness me, I¬íd much rather you were open and. straight forward about them instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. Well? - Well, people can¬ít pay their mortgages. The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees. Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes. It¬ís terribly shameful. The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace - - if we¬íre even to have a hope of winning the next election- Quite right. Ah. Worried about our careers, are we? Gentlemen, if we don¬ít cut spending we will be bankrupt. Yes, the medicine is harsh. but the patient requires it in order to live. Shall we withhold the medicine? No! We are not wrong. We did not seek election and win in order to manage. the decline of a great nation. The people of this country chose us. because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy and we will do just that! Barring a failure of nerve. Anything else? - Prime Minister. You saved the day once again, Crawfie, you¬íre an angel. You can¬ít close down a discussion because it¬ís not what you wish to hear. I don¬ít expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. But what kind of leader am I if I don¬ít try to get my own way- to do what I know to be right. - Yes. But Margaret, one must be careful of testing one¬ís colleagues¬í loyalty too far. We are now one split nation, with a huge gulf dividing the employed from the unemployed. The Thatcher plan is to break the Trade Union movement. There must be closures of uneconomic coal mines, we seek only an efficient industry. The miners are being starved back to work, the need is desperate! There are those who would say hold back, there are those who would make us retreat - But we shall never give in to them. We shall never waver, not for a second, in our determination to see this country prosper once again. A car bomb has exploded outside Harrods department store, killing. six people and injuring 71. Eleven soldiers died today when two bombs were detonated during. military parades in Hyde Park and Regent¬ís Park. Seven horses also died in the blasts. The IRA have claimed responsibility. And now, it must be business as usual. Come on love, get to bed. I don¬ít know why you do this to yourself every year, it¬ís a speech at conference, not the Magna Carta! Time to call it a day, darling. It¬ís ten to three, for God¬ís sake. I know, I¬ím coming DT. Nearly there - Denis! Denis- there you are. Are you alright? My shoes! That¬ís when I thought I¬íd lost you. Mark? Hello darling. No, I¬ím fine. I¬ím very well, How is. Sarah? And the children..? Oh. You can¬ít. That¬ís a pity. I was hoping to see you. Yes. Oh. No That¬ís fine. Really darling. That¬ís fine. Of course. another time. Yes. Darling. Yes. Can¬ít wait. Lovely. Yes. xxx Mark? That was Mark. Not able to come. Boy¬ís always going AWOL. Well it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here. There you go, making excuses for him. Now look where it¬ís got you. Did you know Yul Brynner was a gypsy from Vladivostok? Yes. He moved to Paris when he was fourteen. He played the King of Siam. 4,625 times on the London and Broadway stages. What are you doing? One likes to make an effort. A snifter? You¬íre dead, Denis. Ah. Well, if I¬ím dead. who are you talking to? Shall we dance? The Falkland islands, the British Colony in the South Atlantic, has fallen. Argentina claims its marines went ashore as a spearhead this morning. to capture key targets, including the capital, Port Stanley. Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta. which is a fascist gang. has invaded our sovereign territory. This cannot be tolerated. May I make plain my negotiating position. I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs. The Falkland islands belong to Britain, and I want them back. Gentlemen, I need you to tell me today if that is possible. Possible. just, Prime Minister. We can have a Task Force ready to sail in forty-eight hours. Forty-eight hours? But. We have a very narrow weather window. We can¬ít fight in winter down there. Nobody can. If we are going, we have to go now. Why were the islands left without any naval protection? In the last round of Defence cuts we judged the risk of invasion to be small. Did we? And if you remember, Prime Minister, you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum. Margaret, the cost of sending 28,000 men. and a hundred ships twelve thousand miles, almost to Argentina, will be absolutely crippling. I don¬ít think we should be worrying about money at this point, Geoffrey. We can¬ít afford to go to war. We have to go now. now. The government has now decided that a large task force will sail, as soon as all preparations are complete. Prime Minister we do still have three weeks before our ships reach the islands. All we¬íre saying is that we shouldn¬ít give up on trying to find a diplomatic solution. The U.S. Secretary of State has arrived, Prime Minister. So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They¬íre thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically insignificant, if you¬íll excuse me. Just like Hawaii, I imagine. I¬ím sorry? 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand. and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there. because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all. But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war. With all due respect sir. I have done battle every single day of my life. and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same. but they will rue the day. Now, shall I be mother? Tea, Al, how do you take your tea? Black or white? The Argentinian ship the General Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing. course 273 degrees toward the Argentinian mainland. We are tracking it with our submarine HMS Conqueror. Is this ship a threat? Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday. they launched, then aborted an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again. The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands. Can it really be regarded as a threat? She¬ís been changing course continually. There¬ís a strong possibility that they¬íre attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group. I advise that we engage them: hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others. Send them all back to port. It¬íll play badly internationally. We¬íll be seen as aggressors. This will be an escalation, Prime Minister. If there is to be an escalation, it¬ís better that we start it. It is steaming away, Prime Minister. Sink it. HMS Sheffield, a Type 42 destroyer, was attacked and hit late this afternoon by an Argentine missile. it is seen as a retaliation for the sinking of the General Belgrano, in which over 300 Argentinian sailors died. xxx. Latest casualty figures from the Sheffield. I must write to them. Prime Minister? The families. I must write to them. xxx Foreign Secretary. I¬íve just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse. He told me bluntly that if the Argentinians are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft, they have enough missiles to cripple most of our fleet. President Reagan and President Bellaunde of Peru have some new proposals for the peace plan - The peace plan? There will be no appeasement. This is a war. A war they started and by God, we will finish it. I tell you what I¬ím going to write. to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain. for the Falklands. Lieutenant Colonel Jones. Captain Wood. Captain Dench. I am the only Prime Minister in the history of our country. who is also a mother with a son of my own, I can imagine your agony, and your grief. Prime Minister, we have secured the beach head - The Argentinian troops are demoralized and ill equipped. The paratroops have taken Goose Green. Shortly after dark last night, our forces xxx Port Stanley. xxx what the Commander in Chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack. Thatcher, bed. From their new positions, our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley. Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success. Well done, MARGARET. We congratulate the men and women of the armed Forces for their skill, bravery and loyalty to this country. We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression. and we responded as we have responded in times past: with unity, strength and courage, sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed, in the end, right will prevail over wrong. And I put it to the Honourable Member opposite. that this is not a day for him to carp. find fault, demand inquiries- they will happen I can assure him of that. for we have nothing to hide, no. this is a day to put difference aside, hold one¬ís head high. and take pride in being British. GOTCHA! Well that paid off old girl! Your ratings soared! From the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation¬ís darling. The world was at your feet, and Britain was back in business! The Berlin Wall has fallen. The gates have opened! The police are making no attempt to stop people as they go through. I don¬ít agree. I don¬ít agree in any measure! But Prime Minister the question of the European single currency will come up. I don¬ít think the country is ready for it yet. But we cannot bury our heads in the sand. A lot of Conservative MP¬ís and Ministers are saying - - that there must be a change in that style of management. That Mrs Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in. The point is, Prime Minister, I don¬ít think we can sell the idea of a tax that asks everyone to pay the same. Our policies may be unpopular, but they are the right policies. Prime Minister I just don¬ít think we can ask the poorest of the poor. to pay the same amount of tax as a multi-millionaire. There it is again! Why not? Because - Because people. on the whole. think that the tax is manifestly unfair. Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem, it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! Your problem. Some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven¬ít had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who have had to fight their way up, and who don't feel guilty about it. we resent those slackers who take, take, take. and contribute nothing to the community! And I see the same thing, the same cowardice. in our fight within the European Union. Cowardice. For the sovereignty of Britain the integrity of the pound! Some of you want to make concessions. I hear some of you. agree with the latest French proposals. Well, why don¬ít you get on a boat to Calais? Yes, why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85 % of your income to the French government! Right. What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session, Lord President? And why have we not made more progress to date? What is that? Is that the timetable? I haven't seen that. May I see it? Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course. The wording is sloppy here. and here. If you say so. - I do say so. It¬ís merely a first draft. This is ridiculous. There are two ¬ìT¬ís¬î in ¬ìcommittee¬î! Two ¬ìT¬ís¬î. This is shameful. Shameful! I can¬ít even rely on you for a simple timetable! Are you unwell? Yes. You are unwell. Give me the pencil, give it to me! If this is the best you can do I had better send you to hospital, and I shall do your job as well as my own and everyone else¬ís. Gentlemen. As the Lord President has thosen to come to cabinet unprepared. I have to close this meeting. Good morning! Can¬ít pay, won¬ít pay! Geoffrey- My letter of resignation. Our differences, I¬ím afraid, cannot be reconciled. I have done what I believe to be right for my party and my country. The time has come for others to consider. their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties. with which I have myself wrestled for perhaps too long. Geoffrey¬ís speech in the House of Commons was devastating. xxx He was almost inviting someone to challenge her for leadership of the party. She behaved appallingly. I wouldn¬ít have spoken to my gamekeeper like that. I don¬ít think she can survive this. I¬ím here to announce my decision to put my name forward as leader of the Conservative party. I have nothing but admiration for our Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, but I believe. our party and our country need a new leader. It¬ís extraordinary. I am the Prime Minister. - The rules of the Conservative Party. make it possible for Conservative MP¬ís to depose a sitting Prime Minister. Sweetie? xxx As Conservative MP¬ís gather in Westminster to discus. who they will back in the leadership contest, the Prime Minister said. she would not be diverted from critical international affairs. Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is among thirty four world leaders who came together to celebrate the end of the Cold War and herald. the start of a peaceful new age of East/West cooperation. There¬ís a general feeling that Mrs Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot. We¬íre going to put it to bed tomorrow night, is how one of her campaign staff puts it. M, I really think you should come home and defend yourself old girl. Heseltine is campaigning ferociously. I do think my time is best spent seeing an end to the Cold War. don¬ít you? After all this time they know what I stand for. Will she, or will she not, be in the job tomorrow? Margaret, they can¬ít touch you. Mrs Thatcher has failed to win enough votes to secure an outright. win in the leadership contest and must now decide. whether to put her name forward for the second round. As Mrs Thatcher leaves Paris for London to make a last ditch attempt. to pull together support for her leadership, the ship may have sailed. Treachery! We will never win another election led by that woman. We need a leader who listens. This isn¬ít about her, it¬ís about the party. One must know when to go. The question is, how does anyone put it to her? If you were to stand, I of course would vote for you Prime Minister- of course would vote for you Prime Minister, but I don¬ít think you can win. The loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon. It was the people who put me here - The loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon. - it¬ís up to them to tell me when to go. Margaret, you can¬ít let them do this to you. Please, boss. They¬íll destroy you. Throw in the towel now, love. Don¬ít let those bastards see you humiliated. You just won¬ít win, darling. Not this time. Oh Denis. I am the Prime Minister. Order! Order! The Right Honourable gentleman is afraid! This is a naked strategy of closing some coal mines. and then selling off. - They believe in striking. I believe in working! - This is the woman who¬ís watched. ten men on hunger strike starve themselves to death and never flinched! Despicable. More homeowners, more shareholders, more savings - xxx I offer my resignation. after eleven and a half extraordinary years - proud to have left Britain in a much better state. than when we took office. What¬ís this then? A radio. How useful. Steady, MT. The greatest Prime Minister since Churchill. deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies! All those years of taking the tough decisions. does any of it matter now? It¬ís all been turned to mush! What? - By these fools! These lily-livered pinkos! These inept placators. - Very good! These vacillators. Vacillators! Poll takers. - Popularity seekers. So busy taking the pulse of the public! Weak. Is weak. Weak. - All off them. Weak. Men! Don¬ít they know if you take the tough decisions. Yes, people will hate you today but they¬íll thank you for generations. Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish! All I wanted was to make a difference in the world. And you did, love, you did. All I wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy. happier than I was certainly. xxx Oh, yes. And I wanted you to be happy of course. Were you happy, Denis? Tell me the truth. Denis? Denis? Here¬ís your bag. You¬íre all packed, sorted. Denis wait. Where are your shoes? No, you can¬ít go without shoes! Not yet. - Steady. Yes. Steady. Steady the buffs. - Steady the buffs. No. Not yet. Denis. Wait. I don¬ít, I cant. I don¬ít want you to go yet. Denis. Please. No, no. You are not. I don¬ít want to be on my own. You¬íre going to be fine on your own, love. You always have been. Denis! xxx Mummy- My God, Mum. Are you alright? Yes. - What are you doing. Yes. Mummy you should have called for help, silly old sausage. Have you not even been in your bed properly? You¬íve done all this? - Yes, all sorted. Well don¬ít worry about all this. June and I will crack on with it. I was just going to get dressed. Shall I call someone, see if anyone can come over and do your hair? Oh. No, you do it. Oh, let me do that, Margaret. No, dear, I¬íll do it. Carol said you might go to the House of Lords today? No no. I¬ím not going anywhere. Max. Unfortunate he's just so cute. Here. Hello, stranger. -There you are. -Thanks. lt's nice. -Who's that? -lt's Max. How are we doing, then, girls? Give me that. Let her die. Revenge! -He's your man. -That's my boy. Streets of Berlin I must leave you soon Oh, will you forget me? Was I ever really here? Find me a bar on the cobble-stoned streets where the boys are pretty I cannot love for more than one day But one day is enough in this city Find me a boy with two ocean-blue eyes And show no pity Take out his eyes He never need see how they eat you alive in this city Streets of Berlin will you miss me? Streets of Berlin do you care? Streets of Berlin will you cry out if I vanish into thin air? What's the problem? Watch it! You, too. Come on. l'm a rotten person. Why am l so rotten? Why do l do these things? He's gorgeous, though, isn't he? l don't remember anything. Did we have a threesome? Maybe the two of you had a threesome. Hello. Morning. l look silly. Not now. This place.. Yes? lt's really.. The country will be nice. -What's the country? -The house. Your country house. How do we get to the country? -A car. -Mine? -Shit! -Rosen. Our landlord.

Don't you have any brains at all? -lt's not safe. -Who was he? -Who was who? -The blonde boy. Wolfgang Granz. Guess who his boyfriend was? You're not guessing. Karl Ernst. Who's Karl Ernst? What kind of world do you live in? Aren't you girls ever curious about what's going on? Don't lecture. Who's Karl Ernst? George, actually. What? l'm George, now. Karl Ernst was von Helldorf's deputy. l suppose you have no idea who von Helldorf is. Second-in-command of the Storm Troopers, immediately under Ernst Rohm. Ernst Rohm, l know him. He's that fat queen. Friend of Hitler's. Runs around with many beautiful boys. Goes to all the clubs. Rudy, shut up. -Why? -Just shut up. Mein F√ºhrer had Rohm murdered last night. And all of his friends. And their friends. And their tricks. And whoever happened by. So queer is out. Queer is dead. You just pulled the wrong guy. We can explain it to someone. lt's not as if we knew him. Hello, darling. -So how about you? -Me? Everyone knows l'm not queer. l've got a wife and kids. l've had every whore on this street. l'm just an average kind of guy. -Bye-bye now. -Where are you going? Prayer. -How much? -How much, what? How much did they give you? What a desperate thing to say. Here, take this. -We don't want it. -Shut up, Rudy. -Stop telling me to shut-- -Shut up. lt's not enough. lf they catch us, l'll name names. A threat. l'm utterly terrified. Here.. l'm a true Christian. l won't say a word to the Gestapo until the service is over. Ciao. l'm not leaving Berlin. -We have to. -We don't have to. l've paid up for dance class for the next two weeks. l can't leave. Why did you have to take him home? You've ruined everything. Go back to your fucking dance class. They can shoot you in the middle of an arabesque. Move out of the way. Where will we go? What is it? Do you love him? -What? -The dancer. Christ! l just feel responsible. Fluffs can't afford that kind of responsibility. -Why are you laughing? -That word. ''Fluffs.'' Damn! We aren't allowed to be fluffs, anymore. We aren't even allowed to kiss or embrace. or fantasize. They can arrest you for having fluff thoughts. Uncle Freddie! lt's not funny. l think geraniums are best. The family takes care of me. But you. throwing it in everyone's face. No wonder they don't want anything to do with you. Maximilian. -take the ticket. -l need two. But l haven't the right dress for the dance. Look. Over there. Cute. l suppose. Think he's a fluff? Don't care. Except the baritone. You've been on the run since '34. over a year with that dancer. The family knows all about it. You can't live like that. -Please-- -l need two tickets. -l can't get two. -''l can't get two.'' Nothing really works, does it? Get out. How about a deal?

Just get us both out alive. l can't do things on my own. Not now. l'll have to ask your father. Walk away. Be careful. You should sign on.

Why not? l'm tired of your deals. You know what? This cheese stinks. Why don't we just cross it? What? The border. This guy on the job today was telling me it's easy. He said he knew spots. Spots? Spots to get through. l told him to come talk to you. -Here? -Yes. Rudy, l told you, we don't want anyone to know that we're here. or that we're trying to cross the border. Are you that stupid? -l'm not stupid! -He could tell the police. Okay, so l am stupid. Why don't we just try it anyway? Because l am working on a deal. Who with? l can't tell you. This is crazy.

Where are they taking us? A detention camp. -Probably Dachau. -How do you know? l've been through transport. They took me to Cologne for a propaganda film. -Pink Triangle in Good Health. -''Pink triangle,'' what's that? Queer. lf you're queer, that's what you wear. Like Jews, a yellow star. Political, a red triangle. Criminal, green. Pink is as low as you can get. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. lf you survive the train, you stand a chance. Here's where they break you. You can do nothing for your friend. lf you try to help him, they will kill you. lf you try to care for his wounds, they will kill you. lf you want to stay alive, he cannot exist. This can't be happening. He hasn't a chance. He wore glasses. lt isn't happening. lt is happening. Who is this man? l don't know. Your friend? Look at him. Look! -Your friend? -No. Your friend? -Your friend? -No. Stand up. Hit him. Like this. -Hit him. lt's your friend. -No. Open your eyes. Again. That's enough. Your friend? -No. -No. Stand up. Take him. Hello. -Yellow star? -What? Jew? Yes. l wouldn't have thought it. How did you get that? -What? -Your pink triangle. l signed a petition. -What kind? -For Magnus Hirschfeld. -He wanted to make queers-- -Legal. But the Nazis got him. l was a nurse. They said a queer couldn't be a nurse. Suppose l had to touch a patient's penis? They said rather than be a nurse, l should be a prisoner. So. that's how l got my pink triangle. How'd you get the yellow star? l'm Jewish. You're not Jewish, you're queer. Maybe l'm both. -Then you'd wear both. -l didn't want one. -Didn't want one? -You told me it was the lowest. But so is a yellow star. l didn't want to be a queer. so l worked a deal. -With the Gestapo? -Yes. You're full of shit. l'm going to work a lot of deals in the camp. Sooner or later, they'll release us. l'm only under protective custody. That's what they told me. l'm going to stay alive. Friendship lasts about 1 2 hours in this place. We had ours on the train. You didn't think l'd make it, did you? Off the train. -l wasn't sure. -l'm going to stay alive. -Yes. -Because of you. You told me how. Yes. l did. l'm sorry. About what? l don't know. Your friend. He wasn't my friend. l made a deal. What? A deal. Leave me alone, please. They said. if l could.. They said.. What? Nothing. l think, maybe.. -Okay-- -l made.. They took me. into that room on the train. And they said, ''Prove that you're..'' And l did. Did what? l made love. -Who to? -Her. Only. maybe only 13. She was dead. Just.. Bullet in her. They said, ''Prove that you're..'' And l did. Lots of them. watching. laughing, drinking. ''He's a bit bent,'' they said. ''He can't.'' But.. How? l don't know. l wanted.. To stay alive. -And there was something. -Something? Exciting. Oh, God! l killed him. Sweet lips. Angel. -God.. -She was. She was like an angel to save my life. Don't do that. You mustn't do that. For your own sake, you mustn't touch me. l'm a rotten person. Rotten. No. Get up. Jew bastard. Get up! l'm going to stay alive.

When the entire pile is over there, you take one rock at a time. and you move it back. -And move it back? -Yes. We move rocks from there to there, and then back from there to there? -Yes, sir. -Why? Start moving. He's watching. lt's supposed to drive us mad. -These are heavy. -You get used to it. -What do you mean, drive us mad? -Just that. Makes no sense, serves no purpose. They do it to drive us mad. -They probably know what they're doing. -No, they don't. l worked it out. lt's the best job to have. That's why l got you here. -What? -Don't stop. Keep moving. You two. Over here. You were at the stones. -Was it harder than this? -l suppose so. So it was dangerous. -This isn't? -No. Don't you think you should have asked me? -Asked you what? -lf l wanted to move rocks. lf l wanted to talk to you.. l couldn't ask you. We're in different barracks. Thank heaven. l spent money getting you here. -Money? -Yes. l bribed a guard. -Where did you get money? -My uncle sent me some. -And you bribed a guard? -Yes. -For me? -Yes. -You are mad. -l thought you'd be grateful. l like cutting stones. This is insane. Twelve hours of this a day. l'll be crazy in a week. Like you. -Jesus. -l'm sorry l did it. -You're sorry. -You don't know what's good for you. This is the best job to have. Moving rocks back and forth, for no reason? The best job to have? -Why don't you understand? -l don't want to understand. -l don't want to talk to you. -You have to. -Why? -l got you here to talk. -Hard luck. -l don't want to talk. Move your rocks and l'll move mine. Just don't speak to me. l thought you'd be grateful. lt's so hot. -Burning hot. -You talked to me. Weather talk, that's all. After three days. Everyone talks about the weather. Heard a rumor. -What? -Sardines tonight. Don't like sardines. Only a rumor. Suppose, after all of this. we have nothing to talk about. Was l awful to bring you here? Come on, don't get depressed. Smile. You're not smiling. You can't see me. l can feel you. l wish we could look at each other. l've been looking at you all morning. Yeah? You look sexy. -Me? -Without your shirt. No. Come off it. You know you're sexy. No. Liar. Of course l'm a liar. Your body's nice, too. lt's okay, not great. No, it's nice. Not as nice as yours.

No one can hear us. Can you feel me? Maybe. Feel me. lt's so hot. l'm touching you. lt's burning. l'm kissing you. Burning.

Rocks. never end. -l'm going insane. -Think of something else. l've been up all night. Someone in our barracks killed himself. They hate that. lt's an act of free will. Heard a rumor. -Sardines? -Yes. l hate sardines. l hate all food. Scraps, sardine scraps. that's all we get, anyhow. Not worth eating. Didn't know you could have sardine scraps. -l'm going insane. -All right, it's my fault. This job's the worst. l got it wrong, l'm sorry. l'm glad to be here. How can you be? That's my secret. Maybe if l closed my eyes.. Heard a rumor. What? We may get potatoes. -When? -Tomorrow. -l don't believe it. -They said so in my barracks. -Who is ''they''? -Some blokes. -Are they sexy? -Shut up. -You should be with us, where you belong. -No, but you shouldn't be here. l want to be here. Why? Because l love rocks. because l love you. l do. l love you. lsn't that silly? What are you doing? Arranging these neatly. We've become sloppy. They can beat you for it. Don't love me. lt's my secret. Don't love me. lt makes me happy. And l have a signal. When l rub my left eyebrow at you, like this. it means l love you. l bet you didn't know that. Don't love me. l can't help it. -l don't want anybody to love me. -Too bad. -l can't love anybody back. -Who's asking you to? Queers aren't meant to love. They don't want us to. You know who loved me? Do you know who loved me? That boy. That dancer. l don't remember his name, but l killed him. See? Queers aren't meant to love. l'll kill you, too. Hate me. That's better. Hate me. don't love me. l'll do what l want to do. lt isn't any of your business, anyhow. l don't believe we're doing this. Rocks make sense, but not snow. My hands are.. lt makes a change. You have a barracks leader. -He can get you medicine. -lt doesn't matter. -lf you're nice to the Capo. -lt doesn't matter. -You're losing weight. -l don't like sardines. -lt's getting worse. -And it's getting colder. -You need medicine. -Stop nagging me. l thought you loved yourself. lt's too cold. l'm scared. Who isn't? l want you to care. l would, if l was warm. l'll warm you. You can't. l'm next to you.

You'll feel warm. -l can't. -You'll feel it. ln my fingers. All over. l can't. l'm kissing your fingers. They're numb. My mouth is on fire. -My fingers.. -Are getting warm. Are they? They're getting warm. Yes. My mouth is on fire. -Yes. -Your fingers are on fire. your body's on fire. Yes. My mouth is all over you. My mouth is on your chest, kissing your chest. biting your nipple. -Biting into it. -Yes. Harder. Stop it! That hurts. -Harder. -Stop it! l'm serious. You're hurting me. You pulled away. l did. lt was exciting. For you, maybe. l don't try to hurt you. l like being hurt, it's exciting. lt's not. Not when you're rough. l'm not being rough. Why did you have to spoil it? You were making me warm. Why can't you be gentle? -l am. -You're not. You tried to hurt me. You make me warm and then you hurt me. l hurt enough. l don't want to feel more pain. Why can't you be gentle? -l am. -No, you're like them. You're like the guards. You're like the Gestapo. We stopped being gentle. l watched it. when we were on the outside. People made pain and called it love. l don't want to be like that. l can't do anything right. l don't understand you. l used to do things right. You still can. l want to make you happy. Then be gentle with me. l don't know how. -Just hold me. -l'm afraid to hold you. -Don't be. -l'm afraid. -l'm going to drown. -Hold me, please. Hold me. Okay. l'm holding you. -Are you? -You're here in my arms, l promise. l promise, l'm holding you. You're here. Touch me. -Are you? -Yes. Touching. Gently. Touching. softly. Warm me. Softly. Warm me, gently. Softly. l'm touching you softly. Gently. You're safe. l'll keep you safe and warm. You're with me now. You'll never be cold again. l'm holding you now. safe. and warm. As long as you're here. as long as you're with me. as long as l'm holding you. you're safe. -lt sounds better. -lt does? -Loosening up. -lt is? -Medicine's helping? -Yes. How did you get it? l told you. l spoke to my barracks leader. He took me to an officer. Which one? Some captain, the new one. Why don't you tell me? -You're never going to let up, are you? -Probably not. -Suppose you don't like the answer? -l'll chance it. l went down on him. -What? -You heard. -l didn't. -You wanted to know. l told you you wouldn't like it. That SS Captain? -He's the worst bastard in the-- -l know. -You went down on him? -l had to, l didn't have any money. -You touched him? -No, l just went down on him. That's what he wanted. l needed the medicine. -l'd rather cough. -You wouldn't. That bastard. -ls he queer? -Who knows? Just felt like it, maybe. He could be queer, but you don't like to think about that. -You don't want them to be queer. -l don't. That's silly. For once you're right. lt is silly. There are queer Nazis. and queer saints, and queer geniuses. and queer nobodies. just people. That's why l'm wearing this triangle. That's why you should be wearing it. Do you think the Captain would let a queer go down on him? Somebody straight, yeah, even a Jew. He would kill me if he knew l was a queer. My yellow star got your medicine. -Who needs it? -Then give it back. Throw it away, why don't you? And die. l am tired of being told l should have a pink triangle. Ever go to the Silhouette? Yes. l never saw you there. You weren't looking. -Greta's Club? -No. Good, you had taste. The White Mouse? Sometimes. l'm surprised you never saw me there. Did you sunbathe? l loved to sunbathe. -ln the nude? -Of course. -By the river. -That's right. And you never saw me? Actually, l did. l saw you by the river. You were making a fool of yourself. and l said, ''Some day l'll be at Dachau with that man, moving rocks.'' l didn't like Berlin. l mean, l wasn't happy. But l like it now. l miss it. We'll go back someday. -When we get out of here? -Yes. We will, won't we? We have to, don't we? Yes. -Horst? -What? We could go back together. You. Jew. Yes, sir? Are you feeling better? Sir? Your cold? Yes, sir. -Remarkable. -Yes, sir. Carry on. You! -Pervert. -Yes, sir? Are you ill? No, sir. You have a cough. No, sir. Something caught in your throat? -Yes, sir. -From breakfast? Yes, sir. Carry on. -You. Pervert. -Yes, sir? -You coughed. -Yes, sir. -You're not well. -l am, sir. l see. You. Jew. -Yes, sir? -Watch. -Watch, sir? -Yes. Watch. You. -Yes, sir? -Put down that rock. Good. Now go for a walk. A walk, sir? Yes, a walk. And you. Jew. Up here. Enough. Now take off your hat. My hat, sir? Your hat. Yes, sir. You. -Yes, sir? -Relax. -Yes, sir. -And watch. Yes, sir. -You. -Yes, sir? Throw your hat away. Not there. -Not there, sir? -No. Pick it up. Yes, sir. Throw it on the fence. The fence, sir? The fence. That's all right. We'll wait. Are you better? Yes, sir. Nasty cough. Yes, sir. On the fence, now! On the fence. Yes, sir. You. Yes, sir? Are you watching? Yes, sir. Good. -You. -Yes, sir? Get your hat. -Now, sir? -Now! Are you sure, sir? Quite. Could l do without my hat, sir? No. Yes, sir. He scratched me. You. Jew. Yes, sir? l hope the medicine helped. Get rid of the body. Yes, sir. No! No, it's okay. l won't drop you. l'll hold you. lf l stand at attention, l can hold you. They'll let me hold you. l won't let you down. l never held you before. l won't let you drop. You know what? Horst? You know what? l think.. l think l love you. Don't tell anyone. Don't worry about the rocks. l won't drop you, l promise. l think l loved.. Can't remember his name. A dancer. l think l loved him, too. Don't be jealous. You're safe. l won't drop you. l love you. What's wrong with that? Oh, my God! Isn't it time to stop this travelin', for it dark and the child shiverin'? We will not. And us not two hours, or maybe three, from Chicago itself? "Ha, ha," says I. Get along with ya, ya lazy devils. I'll be layin' me whip on your backs. Chicago will not be movin'. and us living there for the rest of our days, God willin'. I'll not be held back by your tongue. A fine city waiting there just over the rim of the land. "I'll rest there tonight," I said to myself. And so I will. 'Tis a mighty city will be built here. The hub. Yes, the hub of the country. fillin' all this prairie land. and you boys living to see it. <i>Huh, indeed.</i> Come on. Get along with ya. Look, Pa. It's a train. Come on, Pa. Let's race her. By the twinklin' stars of heaven, I will. - Come on, boys. - You'll do no such. Go on, Pa! You can lick it! We're licking it! We're licking it! Whoa! Whoa there! Hold on, boys! Whoa, boy. Whoa there. Whoa! Whoa, boy. Holy Mary, Mother of God. - Pat. Pat! - Pa. Pat. Jack, fix the water, quick. Dion, my petticoat, tear it. - Ma. - Shh! Dion, take off your coat and put it under his head. - Is he hurt bad? - How should I be knowin'? Pour a little water over his head. That's enough. Dion, get the whiskey. Never mind me. Are the rest unharmed? - Not a scratch. - Heaven be praised for that. 'Twas me own fault and no other. Ain't it the devil's own doin', though. to be draggin' me down and then bumping the life out of me? Just when the smell of Chicago's in me nose. <i>Jack.</i> <i>Dion.</i> <i>Bob.</i> Come closer here, the three of ya. and mind what I have to say. 'Tis a grand new place, this Chicago. And them that grow with it will be rich and strong. like I was always minded to be. 'Tis a boom, and you'll boom with it. Someday you'll be fine, big men. a credit to me name. and everybody speakin' with respect of the O'Learys. and how they grew up with the city and put their mark on it. You're wastin' yourself, Patrick. You with your fine talk. It's me last breath I'm usin', and I'll have me say. - Help me put him in the wagon. We've got to find a doctor. - No. No, it's no use. Just bury me here. and let Chicago come to me. that couldn't come to it. Molly. <i>Patrick.</i> - Patrick. - Ma! Holy Mary, Mother of God, help my Pat rest in peace. him that was so restless on Earth, for he was a good man. for all his fine ambitions. And if there ever was to be food to be got or shelter. or you wanted someone to laugh with or have a bit of a good time. you didn't have to look any further than Patrick O'Leary. But I need not be tellin' you all this. who know it better than I do. Amen. Get the horses ready, boys. Good-bye, Pat. Someday, I'll be sendin' the priest. to speak the proper words. Ma, I'll take care of ya. I'll do what he said. You know, about Chicago and. Sure, Ma, we'll take care of ya. I'm gonna make a lot of money and get ya things and. Hush it, the both of you. Get in the wagon. Giddap. Ho! Ma, we've gotta find someplace to stay. - We can't keep on living in a wagon. - Time enough for that. - It's a job I'm looking for first. - Look! <i>There's a theater.</i> Maybe I could get to be an actor. You an actor, and your father not cold in his grave. - But we've gotta do something. - It's school you'll be going to, the three of ya. School, at my age. <i>Whoa.</i> Look. Right under my very eyes. Wait here. I won't be a minute away. And keep your eyes off this picture. <i>- and her in tights or worse. - All right, Ma.</i> Gee! Look at them horses. <i>Ain't they beauts?</i> - Look. They're stuck. - Yeah, in the mud. Young man. I mean you. Could I bother you to assist us ladies to the sidewalk? I'm sorry, ma'am, but I got on my new store-bought pants. Whoa, boy! Whoa, whoa! Ladies, if me and my brother here can make a saddle, maybe we could get you out. - Saddle? - Yes'm, like this. All you gotta do is hold on. Why, that's marvelous. Ada, you try it. That's gonna be grand. Now mind your dress. <i>Dion.! Jack.!</i> - Up to The Hub. - We just slipped. <i>You little brats!</i> - I'll. I'll. - And who will you be hittin'? - Look at me! - A bit of mud, and it behind. A pair of tender hands and plenty of soap, it'll be as good as new. You don't know what you're talking about! There's not a washerwoman in this town that could save this dress. Is that so now? And what would you say if I told you. that I could do it myself, if it was worth me time? All right. You're so smart. You save this dress, and I'll give you. I'll be namin' the price, and you providin' the soap and the tub. <i>Hey, Ma.! Ma, I'm back.!</i> I got three from Gil Warren and two from Mrs. Palmer. - She says a pair of her whatchamacallems are missing. - Oh, she did? You can tell the fine lady she'll get 'em back when she pays for the soap she owes. <i>- Yes'm. - And put up the horse.</i> Give her some oats. And be sure the barn door's fastened. And then get your hands and face washed before it's supper. Yes'm. Gretchen. <i>Ja?</i> - Look out! - The milk! - It's gone! - Oh, it's all right. No use crying over it now. It's spilt. She might've kicked you. I told you never to milk her without putting that bar between her legs. That's what it's for. Daisy, you hussy! Mrs. O'Leary! What will she say? <i>- Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it with Ma. - Ja?</i> <i>Ja.</i> Aw, gee. <i>Ja. Gut.</i> <i>- Thank you, Daisy. - Ma.! Ma.!</i> - Out here, Jack. - I thought you were coming down to court to hear me. With all Chicago waitin' to be washed? Get along with ya. - Where'd I get the time? - I sure made 'em sit up and take notice. - Did you now? - I told 'em just what I thought about 'em. "My client is right," I said, " and you know it. But what do you care about people, as long as you can fill your pockets?" No wonder they say this is the worst city, with politicians like Gil Warren running things. - And how did the fine gentleman like that? - Oh, he was sweatin' plenty. - " Sure," I said. " What do you care about Chicago being bad. - Take the handle. "as long as business is good and you've got all the beef and pork in the world? "But I'll tell you this. It takes more than those things to make this a great city. "It takes people with some sense of decency. to make this not only the biggest city in the world, but the best. " It's a fine silver tongue you ha'. and your father would be that proud of you. And I told him. <i>Here you are!</i> Well, good-bye, boys. Don't let 'em keep you too long. If you see my old lady, tell her I'm sitting up with a friend that was took sick. Have a cigar, Jim. Thanks for the ride. I'll do the same for you. Thanks, lad. Anytime you're coming our way, let us know. - We'll be glad to have you with us. - I'll remember that. Watch the mud on your shoes, Pickle. You know Ma. Hey, Ma! It's me! - Hello, Ma! - Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary. - Hi, Jack. - Hello, Pickle. - Sorry you lost your case, Jack. - Lost? Sure. I, uh. I forgot to tell you. The judge dismissed it. Heaven help me. And all the time I thought he'd won it. Don't worry. Warren won't hold it against you, as long as you lost. I heard about it. A fella said Jack had the courtroom hypnotized. Yeah, everybody but the judge. Had him too, only Gil Warren put him on the bench. Keep your hand away from that. But, Ma, it's just the right size. - Ma, for the last time, will you quit this laundry business? - Why should I be quittin'? 'Cause I don't want my best girl bending over a washtub all her life. - Go along with you now. - I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch, set you up like the finest hussy in town. Huh? Look. Look, Ma. - Where did you get that money? - A fellow paid me. You're lyin'. You've been gambling at that racetrack again. There wasn't any gambling to it, Ma. There are only eight horses in the race. mine and seven others. - All we had to do was shoot the other seven. - Hmph! Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma. How about it, hmm? - I'll not be livin' on money that isn't honestly got. - Give us a kiss then, huh? - Now, Dion, get along with ya. I've got my work. Dion! - Aw, come on. Won't wash out. Look at it. I told that Gil Warren. I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths they'd been drawing pictures on. - Send it back. - Wait a minute. This looks like a map. Maybe Warren's gonna hunt for a buried treasure. Hunt for it? He's already found it in the city treasury. Something about Randolph Street. <i>and. and Madison.</i> This looks like the tracks for the horse car line. I know what it is. This means they're gonna run the car line along Randolph Street. You're crazy. They've already surveyed Madison for the tracks. Sure, they have. That's exactly what makes me think they're gonna run along Randolph. - By golly, maybe you're right. - Of course I'm right! That's the way they cheat the people. get them to invest on Madison Street. and then switch the line by their own property. - What an idea. - You're right. This information is worth a fortune. - Ha! Listen to him. - And I'm gonna get part of it. You with your fine talk and your grand plans. not a penny ever honestly earned to your name. Maybe so. But if I had this corner here. where all the traffic meets, I'd put up the biggest saloon in town. - Saloon? - And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary. I wouldn't be stepping my foot inside. Then I guess we'll have to keep on rushing the growler for you. Oh, but look. There's a name already scribbled in right on my corner. B- F-A-W-C-E-double "T." - B. Fawcett. - Ever heard of him? No. It's a new one on me. - Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind? - I've gotta have this name. We'll go down to Gil Warren's and see what we can find out about this Fawcett fellow. - You've ruined it! - There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary. The scamp. Hello, Rondo. - Where's Mr. Warren? - The other end of the bar. <i>- Hello, Mr. Warren. - Oh, hello, son.</i> - Howdy, Mr. Warren. - What can I do for you? - I'd like to talk to you for a moment. - Sure. Go ahead. <i>It's kind of private, and I thought that, uh.</i> <i>Not now. Not now. Little later, perhaps.</i> Stick around. Glad to have seen you. <i>Whew!</i> - What a woman. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Is she new? - Yeah, she's new, new as far as Chicago's concerned. She was the biggest hit Niblo's Garden in New York ever had. A sensation. And I'm paying her a bigger price. than any entertainer in this town ever got. - That's Belle Fawcett. - Oh, Belle Fawcett. B. Fawcett? Ladies and gentlemen, as an added treat tonight. the proceeds to go to the widow and orphans. or our late bartender, Aloysius O'Malley. who was shot in front of this very door. <i>my little girls are going to give a special performance of our famous classic.</i> <i>Living Statues.</i> an artistic divertissement straight from New York and Paris, France. And remember, gentlemen. it's all for sweet charity, and no tights. What am I bid? <i>- One dollar. - One dollar? Do I hear two?</i> - Four dollars. - Four, the gentleman says. <i>- Who'll make it five? - I'll pay five.</i> <i>Five. Now we're getting somewhere. Who'll make it six?</i> Speak right up, handsome. What is it? Six? I'll pay $100 to charity if Belle Fawcett plays Venus. We have a comedian in the house. - Go ahead. Take his offer. - Sold to handsome for $100. <i>Come on. Let's see the color of your money.</i> Fifty, 70, 90, 100. Whiskey! Right through that door. I'll be with you in a moment. Thank you. Hey, what's this? Wait a minute! Yes, Miss Fawcett. Your carriage is here. Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him for lunch tomorrow at the Palmer House? - Yes, Miss Fawcett. - Thank you. <i>- Good night. - Good night.</i> <i>- Oh! - Get in.!</i> Let me go! - Shut up! - I won't! Let me out of here! - Shut up. - Let me out of here, or I'll jump! Go ahead. Jump. Oh, it's you. Driver! Driver! - No use yelling at him. I fixed him. - Oh, you're crazy! Maybe. But I was sane enough until tonight. Then I heard you sing, and something happened to me. Something swept over me I've never felt before or ever expect to feel again. - What are you talking about? - I'm in love with you, Belle. - Get out, or I'll call the police! - They can't stop me from loving you. Maybe not, but they can sure cool you off, brother. I know it sounds crazy. and I apologize. but it's true. Right now, my heart's pounding so. - Listen to it. Ow! - Oh, you fool. I'm trembling all over. And I wanna be calm and cool so I can make you understand. Say, are you on the level? Absolutely. - But I don't even know who you are. - Does that matter? It does to me. And I'll tell you another thing. - I didn't like that cheap trick you pulled on me. - I had to talk to you alone. What gave you the idea you could make love to me like this? Just give me a chance. I'll tell you the whole story. All right. You can stop here and buy me a drink. No, not here. It's too crowded. Since you've taken me by storm. the least you might do is to take me to your place so we can really talk. Very well, but your story had better be good. All right, George. You can drive to Miss Fawcett's home. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - So this is where you live? - Yes. <i>Way up there on the second floor.</i> I think I can make it. Back to The Hub quick! Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Whew! What a woman. <i>- Let's tell Ma. - Ja. You want to?</i> Do you reckon she suspects? <i>I was never that surprised in all me life.</i> All this hand-holdin' and goo-goo eyein' and sighin' and gigglin'. I'm all wore out tryin' to look the other way. - Aw, Ma. - Now, I suppose you'll be tellin' me. you want to get married. - Why, sure. - You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had. Well, if it's love you're after. I guess a few shirts and tablecloths can't stand in the way. but I won't have you sittin' around and waitin' and not eatin'. You'll be gettin' married right away and I want no back talk about it. Now, give me that pail. And I'd be ashamed, with a fine spring moon outside. and you in a barn puttin' ideas in the head of a temperamental cow. - So, you're in love at last. - Sure, Mike. with you. And are you now? And I suppose it's for me that you're slickin' your hair. anticipatin' yourself in front of a mirror until it's half wore out. Well, you want me to look nice, don't you? And I suppose you'll be holdin' her hands, maybe stealin' a kiss. and her tellin' ya how grand ya are and callin' ya pretty names. Here, let Ma do it. And you believin' her. That shirt! I thought so. Take it off. Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut. Look. "D.V.S.". Who's that? His name is Swift and he sells pigs. Now take it off. - It needs to go back in the morning. - Oh, come on, Ma! Take it off. Take it off. Oh! Who's the best darn washer woman in the whole bloomin' city of Chicago? Ma! Say, Ma! I won my first case! - I knew you would! - Congratulations. The jury wasn't out more than 15 minutes. and the judge said it was the finest speech he's heard all session. So did the lawyer from the other side. And. yippee! Congratulations. I always knew you had it in your tongue. <i>A fellow from the Tribune said he's gonna write it up.</i> - You're gonna get your name in the paper? - Yes! - How much did you get? - Huh? - How much did you get? - You did get paid for it, didn't you? The fellow only makes $10 a week, and he's got a wife and a family. Ten dollars a week? That's just $10 more than you make. - I couldn't take his money, could I? - I give up. I've got one son that steals my laundry and spends his money heaven knows where. another a lawyer and wins cases and don't get paid for them. I should have brought the two of you up as Irish bricklayers, and every Saturday payday. Don't mind her, as long as she can keep her job. - Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me. I may be late. - Hmm. Huh, indeed. Where's he going all dressed up? Where is any of us going? And where is it all going to end? For one thing, we can be going in to supper. I wish you could have heard what that judge said. <i>- That you, Miss Belle? - Yes.</i> - Any messages for me? - No. Nothing except a heap more flowers and some champagne from that same gentleman. Lord, honey, you sure got him snortin' in his sleep. I hope you threw them out. I throwed out the roses, but you knows what a mess broken bottles make. Did you tell him not to come around here anymore? I done told him that till I'm black in the face. These corsets are so tight, I can hardly breathe. As long as the men folks likes a small waist, us gals has got to suffer. - You want anything else, Miss Belle? - No, thank you, Hattie. - Good night. - Good night. - You can call me early tomorrow afternoon. - Yes'm. Get out of here. <i>- Get out.! - But listen.</i> <i>- Get out.! - I'll tell you, I wanna.</i> - Get out of here! - Belle, I wanna talk to. <i>- Get out.! - Listen, Belle. Don't act like that.</i> - What do you mean by breaking into my place? - Don't be like that. - Don't act like that. I want to speak to you. - Get out of here! - Get out of here! Hey! Help! Help! - I want to speak to you. Hattie! Hattie! <i>- You calling me, Miss Belle? - Hattie.!</i> <i>Help! Let me.</i> Police! Murder! Help! Police! Police! Hattie! Let me go! Oh, you! - Now, won't you tell me what this is all about? - I love you, Belle. I mean, really. - Well. - I want the truth. - You have a piece of property on Randolph Street. - Of all the. I thought if you and I were to put up a place like Warren's. only better, more class. we could make a lot of money. But I really meant that about being crazy about you. Why didn't you say so in the first place? I'm a businesswoman. I'd have listened to any proposition. without all this foolishness. - You would've? - Of course I would. What a woman. <i>Right through this way, Mr. Police.!</i> Sorry, boss. but it looks like the fire's out. Now, look, Senator. Gil Warren controls. the Patch with all its votes. You need votes. Now, as long as Warren goes along. with no opposition, he has you and your interests just where he wants them. <i>Who knows, but the day may come when Warren.</i> <i>gets other ideas that'd be embarrassing.</i> - We have an offer to make you. - Now, I have the greatest. attraction that ever came to Chicago. Miss Fawcett. <i>Now with your backing and your money to get us started.</i> we'll open the greatest saloon Chicago's ever known. on the busiest corner in town. and I'll control the Patch. I'll tell 'em how to vote. And what's more, Senator, you see this floor? You see those real silver dollars that Potter Palmer put in there? Well, every month after we get started, Senator. they'll be 1,000 of those for you. What do you say? Are you in? I'm always in the market for marketable goods. Go ahead. Full protection for me, security for you and your family. and a hundred dollars in cash every Monday from now on. Young man, are you trying to bribe me? Why, Commissioner, how can you say such a word? Mrs. Kelly, good evening. Welcome to The Senate, and I hope you enjoy yourself. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr. O'Shaughnessy. Welcome to The Senate. Hey, you mugs, where do you think you are? Take off your hats. Keep on your coats and shake hands with the boss. - Where do you think you're going? - Now listen, shorty. You're taking the wrong "altitude". 'cause this is the only saloon in town I ain't been thrown out of. I'll give you just five minutes. I can do it in three. That's tellin' him. - Captain Jamison. - Captain Jamison, welcome. - And this is my daughter Ann. - Miss Colby. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've been begging Father to bring me here for the opening. - I'm glad he did. - It's marvelous. - I've never seen anything like it. - Thank you. - May I show you to your table? - Please do. Gentlemen, you give me The Senate, I give you Chicago. Father says you're the smartest young man in Chicago. That's because he knows I'll deliver the Patch on Election Day. He says you have a great future, as big as Gil Warren's if you do as he says. He's the boss, and one of America's finest. - And now. I must change my costume. - Allow me. <i>I want to talk to you, my boy. I have some great plans in store.</i> Surely not tonight, Senator, when you have so beautiful a daughter to entertain us. Father won't talk business if I ask him not to. Will you, darling? I can't imagine the senator doing anything that you asked him not to. That's right. She wraps me around her finger all the time. Uh, excuse me, please. - I'll be right back. - We'll expect you. He's nice-looking, isn't he? I mean, for someone from the Patch. - Hello, Warren. - Why, hello, son. - Mr. O'Leary. - Jim-dandy place you've got here. - Thanks. - Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you. - You mean, you're not sore? - Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet. Live and let live. that's my motto. - Come on. Have a drink. - Matter of fact, I wanted a word in private with you. - Oh, sure. Come on in my office. - See you in a minute, Rondo. Rondo, step up to the bar. Anything you want, on the house. Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. - How old are you, son? - Old enough to vote. Why? I was just thinking, you've come along mighty fast. When I was your age, do you know what I was doing? I was rounding up runaway slaves and practically starving to death. - Sit down, Gil. - Take it from me, times have changed. - Everything's youth today. - Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil. I've managed, but you've got a great future ahead of you. Mark my words. Well, I hope you're right. I don't blame you for taking Belle. She's a great woman. I'd have married her if I'd had the chance, but she never cared for me. <i>- It was just a business deal, and you outbid me. - What's on your mind?</i> What would you say, son, if I told you I was gonna close The Hub, quit? I'd say you were up to something. What is it? I'm thinking of running for mayor. Mayor? I've been electing them long enough. Now I'm going to elect myself, if you'll ride along with me. - How do I come in? - You're a smart young fella. If you watch your step, you're going to be a big power in this town. I could build a bigger place and give you trouble, but I've had all I want of this. - You say the word, and I'm through. - You close The Hub? Exactly, and give you an open field. Now, we either work together politically or fight it out. It's up to you. It's a nice place you have here, but, like a tinder box. touch a match to it, and it'll go off like a Roman candle. But what the devil? Chicago is big enough for both of us and more. Together we could run this town and run it right. You, Belle and me pulling together, it'd be a lead pipe cinch. Yeah. Sounds all right. But naturally there's a little expense involved, and right now with the. I took the liberty of bringing my check for $10,000. There'll be more between now and election time. I think we'll manage very well, Your Honor. Now I could use that drink you were talking about. Come on. Now, Belle, you've got to come to my table right now. and have a bottle of wine with me. I'd love to, but you'll have to excuse me for one minute. Belle! Hello. I thought I saw you come in here. I was just telling Dion what a great place you've got. I never saw you looking so beautiful. - I always did say she was the best looker Chicago ever saw. - Thanks. Better watch yourself, son. I'll get her back if I can. - But it looks like it won't be to The Hub. - Gil's closing The Hub for good. <i>Really? Why?</i> There's the music for your song. Better hurry. Dion'll tell you all about it later. Whew! What a woman. Yes, that's exactly what I said the first time I saw her. Remember? Oh, I'm. Miss Colby, Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? - How do you do? So sorry. You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary another few minutes. I'll send him back. - That'll be very sweet of you. - Thank you. - Is that the woman? - Why, yes, I believe so. She's pretty. in a way. - Women like her have all the advantage, don't they? - All except one. I wasn't thinking of marriage. - So you're taking his money? - What's the matter with his money? - The check's good, isn't it? - You know how he feels about us, the threats he's made. I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Ever since I left his place, he's schemed to get even. Now he's trying to do it with your own help. - He knows that if he's mayor. - What makes you think he's gonna be mayor? - But you took his money. - Sure. Sure, and I'll vote for him myself, if necessary. but I didn't say how the Patch'll vote. - Why, that's. - Politics. He'd knife me if he could, and I simply mean to beat him to it. Why, you dirty dog. - You love me? - Certainly not. Go on. Say it before I break your back. Who was that little doll-faced blonde you were smiling all over yourself about? Senator's daughter. I have to be nice to him, don't I? Why weren't you breathing down his neck? Stop it. You and The Senate and Warren on the run. In other words, Mr. O'Leary is rising in the world. <i>Mr. O'Leary and present company.</i> <i>Chief, Mitch is here.</i> Come on in and shut the door. Is it true that you were caught registering under a false name? Gee, chief, how was I to know that guy was already registered? I told you this bozo don't use his head. Oh, have a brain, you. Getting caught with an election coming up. and that reform crowd already yelling its head off. It would serve you right if I let them send you to jail for life. but, no, I've got to sit through a trial and figure a way to get you out. I oughta. Oh, get out. Yeah! Come on out! Now, where were we? Oh, yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Everything fixed? - The district attorney said if you're worried. he'll let us have witnesses to prove Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years. That's the kind of prosecutor I like. - What'd you give him? - The usual. Chief! It ain't fair! It ain't fair! - It ain't fair! - What's the matter? The district attorney. and after we had him all fixed. - What are you talking about? - Well, he fell down. and broke his ankle and he ain't here! - The fool doesn't know how to walk? - And the judge appointed. somebody to take his place and I don't know who. - What's this mean? - It means it ain't fixed. Oh, come on. In view of the unavoidable detention of the district attorney. the court has appointed a special counsel. a representative of the Election Reform Committee. <i>in the case of The City of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell.</i> <i>Mr. O'Leary, are you prepared to proceed?</i> - We're ready, Your Honor. - Oh, yes. - Is the defense ready? - Uh, Your Honor. Your Honor, certain matters have come up. New evidence have been uncovered that compels me to. Go ahead with the trial. - Go ahead? - Proceed. The defense is ready, Your Honor. You may proceed, Mr. O'Leary. Your Honor, it is no secret that multiple voting. for years has been a common practice. in that section of Chicago known as the "Patch. " So common, it has come to be regarded as one of the minor evils. in that district. Men who occupy the highest offices in this city. openly and brazenly bid against each other. for that very vote. Any mention of it is dismissed with an indulgent smile. as something that should not be talked about. There are men in this very courtroom, Your Honor. who control every election in this city. with such illegal votes. Men who sit in their fine saloons. surrounded by every luxury that money can buy. or that they can steal. while public officials bow and smile before them and fight for their favor. Until today, nobody has ever obtained sufficient evidence to convict them. Now, however, we have an eyewitness. who was actually present when the defendant, Edward Mitchell. <i>was caught attempting to register under four different names.</i> The last time, as the beloved Bishop Cornwall himself. <i>You know, he's really good.</i> - Some day he'll be a great lawyer. - I think he's all right now. Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue to the stand. <i>Carrie Donohue take the stand.</i> - She can't do this to me. - Shh! Quiet! Stand up. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - so help you God? What's your name? - I do. - Carrie Donohue. - Sit down. - Miss Donohue, you know this defendant? - Do I know him? - Hmph! That big squirt. - None of that now. - I'll haul off. - Quiet! <i>- Order in the court. - Refrain from personal remarks.</i> Tell the court what you know about this man's registration. - Well, my gentleman friend's. - Face the judge. hired to watch the registration and I'm keeping him company. when this big squirt walks in. <i>- Well, he don't see me and I don't say anything.</i> but when he keeps comin' back, I get suspicious. and I'm just about to tell my friend that something funny's going on. when, sure enough, back he comes again. and, this time, he says he's a bishop. <i>Well, that's too much even for me.</i> <i>Order in the court.</i> - That's what you get for marrying 'em. - You married to this woman? - What? - Can you imagine it? - Ever divorce her? - No! - Your Honor! May it please the court, we ask that this woman's testimony. be stricken from the records. and this case dismissed on the grounds that the law says. a wife cannot testify against her husband! <i>- That woman is my client's lawful-wedded spouse.! - Madam, is this true?</i> <i>- Well, I married him once, if that's what you mean.</i> <i>- but I can tell you. - That will do.</i> - Well, I mean that he. - That will do. Well. Hmph. Mr. O'Leary, you distinctly told me. that you had had time to familiarize yourself with all the facts in the case. and, yet, you take up this court's time allowing your only witness. to testify, although she's clearly unqualified. Your Honor, I assure you, this is as much a surprise to me as it is to you. I ask the court's pardon. Case dismissed. - Tough break, kid. - Yeah. - Congratulations. - Aw, you can never tell about these women. They'll put it over on you every time, if they can. but you were great yourself, I was proud of you. Wait'll I go after the big fish, the higher-ups. - then you'll really hear something. - That's the way to talk. - How about meeting Belle? - It's about time. Belle, this is brother Jack. Jack, Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? - I've been looking forward to this for a long time. - You have? - Yes. Dion isn't the only admirer of beauty in the family. Thank you. - That was a very nice thing to say. - I couldn't help. but look at you all through the trial. Maybe that's why you lost your case. - Uh, can we drop you someplace? - Oh, no. No thanks. I've, uh. I've got some things to do here in the building. You know, it seemed kind of funny, you and Dion on one side. and me on the other, fighting each other. When we were kids, we were always fighting. I bet if any other Irishers tried to horn in. it was the O'Learys against the world. - Oh, you said it. - You two must've had fun when you were little. - We still do. - Even though we don't always see eye-to-eye. Well, I've got to leave you here. but I'll tell ya what you do, Miss Fawcett. - or shall I call you "Belle"? - Please do. Let Dion bring you up the house some time for dinner, meet Ma. Well, I'd be delighted. I wanna show you some pictures of Dion. in his First Communion suit at the age of nine. And some of you without any suit at all at the age of six months. I wish you'd keep an eye on this fellow for us. He's getting up in the world so fast, it might go to his head. I'd kind of hate to have to knock it off. I'll try. Good-bye. See you soon. Good-bye, Jack. - You know, I like him. - They don't make 'em any better. That was nice of him, wanting me to meet your mother. Well, yes. I've been thinking about that myself. Oh, don't. I understand how she feels about me. Oh, Ma's all right. A little old-fashioned, perhaps. Oh, please. I had no idea he was so. so human. Oh, sure. Takes after me. You know, there's something almost normal about him. He just looks so real, you know he believes everything he says. Honestly, it just makes me sick to think of a man like Gil Warren. trying to run Chicago when there are men here like your brother. Can you imagine the mayor he'd make if he had the chance? Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up with that reform crowd. Wait a minute. - I've got an idea. - What? I just thought what do with that check Gil Warren gave me. Back to The Senate. In brief, we've come here to ask you to run for mayor. - What? - We have canvassed the field, and you're the man we want. Well, this is all very flattering, gentlemen. May I. May I ask whom you represent? The respectable people of Chicago. citizens who want a new deal in our city administration. We're organizing a reform party. - I'm not sure I'm the man. - We're willing to take that chance. - It's a great opportunity. - Decent people are waiting for an honest program. You'll carry every district, except, perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch. I'm not so sure he won't get that too. Your brother's influential there. Surely he'll support you. I'm afraid you can't count on my brother. You see, we O'Learys are a strange tribe. - Then we'll win without the Patch. - Chicago needs you. - Yes, Mr. O'Leary. - Will you do it, sir? Thank you, gentlemen. I'll run. What did he say when you suggested that I would support him? He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you. Well, at least he's agreed to run. That's the first step. What worries me is, can you control him once he's in? He's a pretty stubborn young fellow. You leave that to me. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. - How's that? - Not bad. Of course, it doesn't look much like you. "Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor. Reform ticket. " That's a great thing for Chicago. I'd like to help. - You help me? - Sure. Why not? If other people say you're good enough to be mayor, I'm not going to say no. Of course, I couldn't support you openly. You know how I feel about the Patch. Oh, of course. No strings attached. - The fact you're my brother wouldn't mean a thing. - Stop arguing, will you? If you stood in the way of something I felt oughta be done. I'd go after you as fast as I would after anybody else, maybe faster. Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago as a great city people can be proud of. I'd wipe out all this mushroom growth. start all over on a sound basis, with steel and stone. You don't have to make speeches to me, Jack. I just wanted you to know where I stand. - Well, how much do I owe you? - I'm two games up on you. Ah. Twenty cents. What a gambler. It's in the blood. It's in the blood. Say, why don't you get Belle and come to the house tonight and take her and Ma for a drive? - Ha! You know Ma. - We'll get a couple of beers under her belt. Well, heaven help us if it doesn't work out. - To His Honor, the future mayor. - To Chicago! And to herself, the first lady of the city! Oh, to the lot of you! - The compliments of the season to you, ma'am. - Oh, go on. More presents. You should see the grand house we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing. - And a butler in short pants. - Heaven help me. <i>It's himself.</i> <i>- Pa.! - It looks just like him.</i> Sure got my nose. I can remember the day we took it like it was yesterday. and the trouble we had puttin' the collar on him. - Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him? - Hang him? You'll do no such. He's gonna spend the rest of his days on this organ. If he only could have seen it himself. Isn't he beautiful? I want the baby to see it. Look, that's your grandpa. Aw, Pat, would you believe it? And Bob just a baby himself. If you turn out half as good as the blood that's in you, I'll not complain. You know, Ma, it looks like Pa had. sort of a roving eye for the ladies. I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head. Roving eye, ha! I'd like to catch him. Look. You're so good to me, the lot of you. You'll have me in tears. - Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry. - Listen to him. We'll play him a tune, his favorite one. - Come on, Ma, and play it. - Come on, the four of you. We'll show him a thing or two. The O'Learys against the world. The O'Learys against the world! - We will. Come on, Ma. You should've seen your father dance, as light as a canary. and stealing a kiss before you could shut your eyes. And the fair Molly Callahan loving it, I'm thinking. And why shouldn't I be loving it? Himself as fine a man as ever stood up with a girl in front of an altar. And that's what you should be doin'. - That's what I was telling him today. - Is it herself, you mean? I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman. You oughta know her. Hmm. I will not. And her workin' in a saloon like any hussy. - Oh, that's not fair, Ma. We're living in modern times. - That's right. Don't forget, things have changed since you were a girl. This is 1870. Times may have changed, but I haven't changed. And I don't want any daughter-in-law that's the talk of the town. and kickin' her heels in the air for anyone to see. When you were a little one, no bigger than that, and me over a tub. I used to dream of the day when you'd bring me home a sweet one. and her all blushes, and present me with fine grandsons. as would be like sons of my own, only sweeter. It's my own life, Ma. Who'll have some more beer? - Me. - I wouldn't mind another drop. Here, Ma. Put a head on it. <i>Good evening, Mr. Jack. Will you tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here?</i> <i>- Oh, thanks. - He'll be right out.</i> Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget about it, and let's go for a ride, huh? Oh, sure. How about it, Ma? - That I will. - Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat. Aw, Ma. There you are. Drink it all, Ma. Come on, Ma. Now, First Lady, I've got a real surprise for you. two of the fastest fillies you ever sat behind. Now, close your eyes and get inside. Close 'em. Up one step. There you go. Inside. Ma, this is Miss Fawcett. This is Belle. - Hmm! So it's a trick. - No, wait a minute! You're going to meet Belle, so you might as well get used to the idea. - The devil I will. Let me out. - Ma, you always were so stubborn. If you don't stop it, I'll give you the licking of your life. - Well, you don't think I'm gonna ride with her! - Oh, come back here! Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on! Let me out! Let me out, I say! - Sit still! - Let me out! Stop it, I tell you! I won't be treated this way! You Irish lunkhead! What do you think you're doing? My son an Irish lunkhead? How'd you like to be treated? You with your grand manners. Just as any woman who's going to be his wife has a right to be treated. <i>He'll never marry you. And now, if you'll stop, I'll be takin' my leave.</i> - Stop here. - Whoa! - Wait. I'll get out. - You'll do no such. It's you who'll be saving the wear and tear of walking. - Ma. - Hmm! How could you? I'm sorry. I didn't think Ma would act like that. Take me home, please. My friends. this campaign has resolved itself. into one clear-cut issue. Shall the Patch run Chicago. or shall Chicago run the Patch? I promise you that if I am elected. the Patch will either be cleaned up. or it will be wiped out like that. <i>Hooray for Gil Warren.!</i> - Who said that? - Shh, shh. - Oh, it's a shame. - The trouble with him is he looks too honest. People never trust an honest man in office. Well, I wish he hadn't tried it. He'll never beat Warren. Never say never about politics. What are you up to now? Well, I was just wondering what would happen. if all Gil Warren's ward heelers and poll watchers and repeaters. failed to show up on Election Day. - What do you mean? - He wouldn't stand much chance of being elected, would he? George, drive to Commissioner Beavers'. Gil Warren's my friend. I won't do it. I can't. I won't do it! I can't! I'll be ruined forever. For doing your duty? Oh, come, come, Commissioner. Be a man. He'll kill me. Besides, what you're asking is against the law, against all my principles. You've been getting $100 a week for doing what I tell you. Every cent I got was in cash. Sure, I paid you in cash, but I always sent it by a different man. What? What do you mean? Those 15 or 20 people would make fine witnesses if you ever got any ideas. Blackmail, eh? All right. I'll fight. Go ahead. Fight. And you'll be back pounding the pavement so quick, it'll make your head swim. Come on. He'll be there. Hey, you! Where's your ticket? - I'm with him. - You know this guy? - I never saw him before in my life. - One of us is in error. Outside, before I cloud up and rain all over you. - That severs our relationship. - One of them Reform guys. They got no manners. Belle, when you were working for me at The Hub. I bet you didn't think you'd be having the first dance with the future mayor, did you? Are you counting your chickens before they're hatched? - It's a lead pipe cinch. - Oh. You looking for me, Commissioner? Hey, look what you done to my suit! - Hey, what's the idea? - Stop it! <i>Stop them, somebody.! Stop them, somebody.! Stop them.!</i> Ladies and gentlemen! The house is pinched! Stay back! Get back! You can't get out this way. Can you beat that? And just when we were beginning to have a little fun. You let me catch you with that Colby woman again, and you won't call it fun. Come on, come on. Inside. Inside. All right, take it away. - What about it, chief? - Yes, what about it? It's all right, boys. It's all right. You haven't got a thing to worry about. I'll have you out of here in no time at all. - What about the bail? - If it's bail they want, I've got it! Better hurry, chief. The polls are open already. Don't worry. You'll be at your posts in 30 minutes. All right. What's the bail? Sorry, Mr. Warren. Orders are to hold them 24 hours without bail. - On suspicion. - What kind of suspicion? - Suspicion of what? - Just plain suspicion. You can't do that. This is Election Day. They're my workers. By the Eternal, you've got to let them go! - It ain't up to me. - I'll get the commissioner! I'll get Senator Colby! I'll get my lawyer! I'll tear this town wide open! - Where's Commissioner Beavers? - Gone to the sanitarium. - What sanitarium? - I'm not allowed to give out his address. Doctor's orders. - Where's Judge Bender? - Oh, the jud-jud-judge. - I've got to see Judge Bender! - Judge Bender left. on a h-hunting trip this m-morning. All the jud-judges in town went with him. They're o-organizing a h-hunting club. - Then I've got to see Senator Colby. - I'm afraid that's imposs. You can't do it. See, S-Senator Colby. It's 12:00! The polls have been opened six hours, and I'm tied hand and foot! Every man in that jail controls at least 10 votes, enough to swing the election. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna stop squawking. - What's that? - You're through. I've sold you out. Don't try anything, Warren. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go and vote for my brother. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. Look at him. You know, he really looks like a mayor. Gee, I bet Ma feels great. <i>Dion, look at this!</i> Huh. Huh, indeed. Belle, we're friends, aren't we? I hope so. I've got a proposition to put up to you. It may startle you at first, but I think you'll see my point. I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me. - And you want me to help you? - Exactly. But after all, what has it to do with me? You know how things are down there. Everything that's rotten in Chicago comes out of the Patch. The whole thing is an atmosphere of vice and crime. It's getting out of control, and I'm gonna wipe it out. How? The law gives us the right to condemn property. The courts will have it appraised and set a fair price. It's what they call the right of eminent domain. It's perfectly legal and fair. But all of Dion's money is tied up in The Senate. Mine too. That's what's worrying me. If he won't see it our way, there'll be trouble. I don't know what to say. Dion's a great person. He can go anywhere, do anything. if he only gets on the right track. Belle, I want to see him marry you. <i>have a home and children, get something real out of life.</i> Don't you think that's what I've been hoping for? That's what he wants too, if he can only see it. What do you want me to do? He couldn't stand a public investigation. You know how he operates in the Patch. I couldn't do a thing like that. <i>Believe me, Belle.</i> if I can't bring him to his senses any other way. I'll start an investigation that'll crack this town wide open. <i>I'll use you as chief witness against Dion.</i> <i>let you tell the whole rotten story of how he operates in the Patch.</i> <i>How do you feel about that, Belle?</i> I just wanted Belle to understand my position. same as I want you to understand it. - Dion, listen to Jack. - I heard him. I know now where he stands. You knew exactly where I stood before the election. I told you and I told the people of this city. - I elected you, not the people. - You? Sure. It was my idea. I sent that committee to see you. I paid for it, ran it, framed it, threw Warren's men into jail. I even voted for you. I don't believe you. Is that true? <i>- Yes. - I just wanted it to look hunky-dory.</i> Why did you want me to be mayor? Oh, a lot of reasons. I wanted to see if I could do it. Or maybe it was because I wanted to see the smile on Ma's face. when she rode with you in the carriage election night. All right. You elected me, but I'm mayor. Yes, you're mayor, but I'm Chicago. I'd hate to have to kick you out. Don't try it. A lot of people like what I'm doing. - What are you going to get out of this? - Nothing. But I happen to have sense enough to see what Jack's after, even if you haven't. - Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start. - You keep out of this! Well, of course, since you've gone for Reform. I guess we won't be seeing very much of each other. You're not gonna walk out on Belle like that. It seems that she's the one that's done the walking out. Dion. Dion! Oh! <i>A grand jury investigation.! Terrible.! Terrible.!</i> How did you ever get involved in such a mess? I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you weren't. in for a bit of sweatin' yourself, Senator. You've been milkin' the Patch for a long time. Me? Why I'll give you to understand, sir, that my life is an open book. Open or shut, brother, your shirttail's out with the rest of us. It's my daughter I'm thinking of. I'll have to take her to Europe, get her away from here. - The trip would do her good. - I'll have to ask you. not to see my daughter again ever. - To think I should be so deceived in the character. - I've always wanted to see. what a senator looks like. when he gets a good, swift kick in the pants. - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? - I'm hurrying, honey. Miss Belle, you want this old plush? Yes. No. Throw it away. I don't care what you do with it. Oh, this just fits in my trunk. Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use in you carryin' on like this. - Ain't no man worth it! - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? <i>I'm hurryin', honey.</i> - Get out of here! - I'm gettin' out, honey. - Get out of here! - Belle, don't act like that. <i>Belle, I want to talk to you.</i> Hattie, get out of the way! - Get him away from me! - Get out of here, white man! - Hattie, help me! Help me! - Murder! Police! Help! - Get out! - Belle, please. I'm sorry, but I had to come. Just let me say one thing, then you can put me out. I won't care. - Oh, please go. - I don't ask you to forgive me. I've said and done things no woman could ever forgive. But you've got to believe I love you, Belle. I always have and I always will. Oh, why talk about it? But you said you loved me. That's over. You can't change in a moment any more than I can. We can't do without each other. I can. I'll make myself. Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll go on fighting, but we'll do it together. We were meant for each other. Belle, marry me. Now. Tonight. I've got the license and the ring. We'll go to Jack, have him marry us. Will you, Belle? Oh, my darling! Come on, Mr. Policeman. Right in here. She. She's done backslid again. Do you realize that 75% of the buildings in the Patch. are made of pine? There are no sewers, no hydrants. Nothing but filth, cesspools. But worst of all, it is a veritable firetrap. Now, that sort of thing may have been excusable when Chicago was just beginning. but that time has passed. Today it's a menace to a great city. a cancer that must be cut out. Now, I propose to condemn the whole district. wipe it out and start all over again. Yes, what is it? Tell him I'll be right out. Will, uh, you gentlemen go ahead with the discussion. and excuse me for a little while, please? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Well, Jack, you've won. - I've won what? - I've been a fool. I wouldn't take a million for this moment. Now it's really the O'Learys against the world. Well, here's the little lady who's responsible. As if I didn't know it. As the mayor of this great and noble city, can you marry people? Marry? Why, sure! Wait a minute. I'm not so sure. But I'll find out. What a mayor. Is there anything in the charter about whether the mayor can perform a marriage? - I don't know, sir, but I'll find out. - Hurry up and find out! "Having taken these pledges of your affection and vows of fidelity. "I do, therefore, by right of the authority in me vested. "by the laws of the state of Illinois. "pronounce you, Dion Patrick O'Leary. "and you, Belle Catherine Fawcett. lawfully married, husband and wife. " That makes us kissing kin, doesn't it? - I don't have to tell you how lucky you are. - That's right. - I just want to say congratulations. - Thank you. I wish you every happiness and. good night. Congratulations. Good night. You'll never know how much all this means to me. Remember that day I told you he wasn't so bad? The O'Learys are a strange tribe. Right. Now, let's go home and tell Ma, huh? Sure, but first there's just one little matter I'd like to clear up. And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose you go ahead and testify against me? Listen to him. You didn't think I was gonna let you two get away with it, did you? - Why, Dion! - Go ahead with your grand jury investigation. She's my wife, and you know the law. A wife cannot testify against her husband. Oh! Belle, where are you going? What do you think of that? Why, you dirty. I haven't licked you since we were kids. <i>Of all the low, disgusting tricks you ever pulled, this is the worst.</i> Well, you won't get away with it. I'm gonna wipe out the Patch and you along with it! - Johnson! - Yes, sir. I've sent for the police. I don't want the police! Get the city attorney! Tell him to start the condemnation proceedings. And you get out of here! I never want to see your face again! Get the police commissioner. Tell him to swear in 500 special deputies. Get the newspapers. Tell them that when I get through with the Patch. <i>- there won't be a stick or stone left standing. - Yes, sir.</i> Hey, one at a time. Quit that nudging. You'd think you never been fed before. You're so full already, you oughta be sleepin' it off on the parlor sofa. Mutter, Mutter, komm schnell! Stop that heathen jabbering and talk sense! <i>Dion, Jack, they fight! Bitte, Mutter, komm.!</i> The devil you say! You can take one more nip while I'm knockin' their heads together. - Dion married Belle Fawcett. - What? Yeah, Jim Fellows just came by to tell us. Dion and Jack have had a knock-down, drag-out fight about the Patch. - And them grown-up and brothers. - I'm gonna find 'em. Wait. I'll go with you. And wait till I get my hands on that Dion. fightin' and marryin' that creature behind my back. Mrs. O'Leary! Mrs. O'Leary! Oh, Mrs. O'Leary! Your barn! Look! Look! I didn't put the bar between Daisy's legs. Fire! Fire! Get Daisy and the calf and the horse! Get that baby back into the house! Fire! Turn the alarm! Fire! Turn the alarm! Fire! Come on, boys! Never mind the barn! Let it go! Save the house! The house! Mrs. O'Leary, I'm gettin' out everything that I can. Mrs. Donovan, your own house is a-goin'! Me own house? Mrs. O'Leary, me own house is a-burnin'! - Get that cow! - Come on, Daisy! Come on! <i>Get a hose over here.!</i> <i>Come on.!</i> Giddyap. - Chief! - Dion! Here I am, Pickle! Dion, oh, Dion! - What's the matter? - There's a big fire in the Patch! - Yeah? Where? - DeKoven Street. The whole street's goin'! You suppose that's some of the mayor's doings? Sure. The mayor's burning us out. <i>- He said he'd get us. - Said he wouldn't leave a stick or a stone standing.</i> - Looks bad, boy. - Yeah, burning us out, huh? - Couldn't even wait for condemnation proceedings. - I'll go with you. No, you stay here. I've gotta find out how Ma is. Give the boys a drink. I'll be back in half an hour. He's asked for a fight. Well, I'll give it to him. Well, what'll you fellas have? - I'll take some of this. - Mighty funny business. - What? - Well, I'm not saying anything. but I haven't got much faith in these fights between brothers. not when they're O'Learys. They've pulled some pretty smart tricks in the past. and I wouldn't put it past 'em to do it again. You heard what Dion said! No one's gonna burn him out, brother or no brother. Well, I hope not. When I was running things, nothing like this happened. - Hmm! Come on, fellas. - All right, boys. You heard what he said. Spread the word. We'll have something to say about bein' run out of the Patch. Wait a minute. Get the boys together. - Tell them that I said we'll meet at the armory. - We'll get this Jack O'Leary! Back up! Back up! I've gotta get through! Back up! Here, I think I can make better time on foot. All right, boys! Put her on the other roof! - Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! Mary! All right, boys, pump! It's moving might fast in this wind, leaping ahead blocks at a time. <i>The Patch is like tinder.</i> <i>There hasn't been a drop of rain for nearly three months.</i> We've got to keep it away from the gas works. We gotta keep it south of the river. Have you any suggestions, General Sheridan? Yes. Make a firebreak at the edge of the Patch. Blow up that entire section along Randolph Street. - Fight this fire with dynamite! - I authorize you to do everything possible to stop this fire. Commissioner, mobilize your whole force. Swear in as many deputies as you need. Clear that whole area. - Requisition all the foodstuffs you need. - Yes, sir. Donovan, you and Johnson get in touch with Milwaukee, all the surrounding cities. Ask them to send us all the fire apparatus they can. Wire Washington. Tell them we're gonna need relief. money, medicine, troops. - Keep me advised. I'll be with Gen. Sheridan. - Yes, sir. Miss Belle, pull yourself together! Come on, honey. Let's get outta here. Come on, baby. Pull yourself together. Let's get out of here before judgment day gets us. Come on, honey. Come on. Bob! Bob! Where's Ma? She's gone to the North Side with Gretchen and the baby in the wagon. They had to go. Our house was the first to burn. - Our house? Why, that dirty. Where did they start it? - In our barn. Ma heard about you fighting, she left the lantern in there and Daisy kicked it over. I thought Jack did it to burn out the Patch. That mob thinks so too. We gotta get to him. - Well, where is he? - I don't know, but we've gotta stop that mob. - Back up, I tell you! - How can I back up? Why can't you look where you're going? Get that flea-bitten thing out of here! Come, darling, get out. We have to walk. Wait! I'll just be gettin' it. I'll not be leavin' his picture. It's all I've got left. That fool cow! <i>Look out! The wall! It's falling!</i> <i>Mutter.!</i> <i>- Gretchen! Gretchen! - Mutter.!</i> Gretchen! Don't waste any time. Get those people behind the line. - Captain! - Yes, sir? Take all of your men you can spare. Use some of mine if necessary. Search every building. See that no one is left behind. No one! Quickly! Yes, sir. Sergeant, move all police lines back one full block and let no one through! Hey, where are you going? - I've got to get through to The Senate. - Nobody's going through. Mayor's orders. The streets cleared. They're gonna dynamite. - Dynamite? - Yeah, to make a firebreak. Come on, open up! Get back! Back to the next corner! - Come on. Back to the next block. - What are you gonna do? I don't know. Jack! Jack! Get back! Come on! <i>- I've gotta get through.! - Jack! Jack, I.</i> Turn him loose. I'll take care of him. Get away from here, you dirty, contemptible liar. I've stood for all I'm gonna stand from you. <i>I've got work to do, and nobody is gonna stop me.!</i> You've got to listen to me! Gil Warren and his mob are out to get you! Everybody down here thinks you set fire to the Patch. They're organizing against you. It's my fault. I thought so too. - You lowdown, good-for-nothing. - Jack! Until I got home and found the house burned to the ground. - Ma, Gretchen and the baby gone. - Where are they? I put 'em in a wagon and started them for the North Side. They oughta be across the river by now. I'm sorry. I should have known better. Jack, you've got to believe me. There's Gil Warren and his gang now. What the devil do I care about Warren and his gang now? The only thing that matters is that we're together and thinking alike. Come on! There they are, men! Just like I told you. The O'Learys. The three of'em together. You men, hold that line! Don't let anybody through. Keep those people back. I don't care how you do it, but keep them back! Right. Men! Listen! Listen, men! The fire was an accident. My brother didn't have anything to do with it. That's what you say, but we know different. We've got to dynamite. It's our only chance to save Chicago! <i>Let it burn.!</i> Men! Men! Think! That's just what we're doing. Thinking. Thinking it's another O'Leary trick. <i>- Mayor O'Leary.! - Yes, General?</i> Have your men move this crowd back to the end of that street. - The dynamite is set. We're ready to light. - All right, move that crowd! Push them back! Get 'em back! Oh, no, you don't! We're not moving! No one's running us out. We got rights too, and we know where we stand. <i>You're not gonna blow us up. You don't dare.</i> We're not gonna let 'em destroy our homes to save their own. <i>We're staying right here. We'll show 'em who they're dealing with.</i> They don't own Chicago. They're. What? <i>Hey.! Look.! Look.! Stop him, somebody.!</i> Dion! Dion! Don't move an inch, men. We've got our rights. - Dion! - Jack, light 'em. Light 'em! - You're hurt. - It's just a scratch. Get back, you fools! All of you! And keep back! Light 'em. Dion! Dion! <i>Get back, and keep back.!</i> <i>Get him, Rondo.! Rondo, get him.!</i> <i>Get him, Rondo.!</i> <i>Get those fuses out.! Pull 'em down.! Pull 'em down.!</i> <i>Get 'em down.!</i> We're too late! We're too late! Run for your lives, men! <i>- We can't put 'em out.! - Run for your lives!</i> Where's Jack? Jack! Open up! Help! Help! Help! On to the lake, folks! Cast off! Let go of that forward line and get this boat away from here! There's 10,000 barrels of kerosene in that warehouse. If this boat catches fire, the warehouse is sure to go. and we'll take the whole North Side with us! Try to get through to the North Side! <i>On to the lake.!</i> <i>Bob.! Bob.! Bob.!</i> That's Gretchen! <i>- Bob! - Gretchen.!</i> Bob! Gretchen! <i>- Bob.! - Gretchen!</i> Bob! Bob! Gretchen! Take your foot off that picture! Oh! Mrs. O'Leary! I thought I saw you. Lean on me. - Go on. Save yourself. - Please, Mrs. O'Leary. - Oh, it's you. - Give me your arm. - I will not. - You'll be killed! I'll not be owing my life to you! Hattie! Hattie! Hattie! Come on. Get up, please. Please. Come on. Come on. - Go on and save yourself. - I won't leave you. Hattie! Hattie! - You married him. - Hattie! I married him, but it's all over now. He only married me to save the Patch. You're lyin'. He loves you, and you turned him against his own people. - He doesn't love me. - But you love him. <i>Hattie!</i> Yes. Yes, I love him. - Try, Mrs. O'Leary. - I can't do it. - Please. - No, it's no use. I'm done for. Please help me. Please help me, won't you? Won't you, please? Dion, any word of them? No. No, I've been all over the North Shore. There's not a trace of them. You stay with Gretchen. I'll look. No. I'm gonna try the South Shore. Mommy! <i>Mommy.!</i> <i>Mommy.!

Come on up out of the wet. - Oh, my child. - Ma. Where are the others? Bob and Gretchen and the baby are all right. And Jack? Oh, Ma. He's dead? - Did you make it up with him? - Yes. Then I'll not be weepin'. It's the livin' that need lookin' after. Belle. - Belle? - What kind of a woman are you. with that kind of a heart and him your husband? It's gone, and my boy's gone with it. But what he stood for will never die. It was a city of wood, and now it's ashes. But out of the fire will be coming steel. You didn't live to see it, my lad. no more than your father did before you. God rest the two of you. But there's Dion left, and his children to come after. He'll have his dream, Ma. Nothing can lick Chicago, any more than it could lick him. Aye. That's the truth. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. There's strength in us. And what we set out to do, we finish.

No. Blanche did, to prove she's no gold digger. You want me to go to India? Making out with your baron in some rat hole won't get you far. He loves me. I even met his friend. He's just showing he can get a pretty girl into bed. Love is best in fairy tales. You have no heart. The only thing interesting in love is making love. Too bad you need a guy for that. We're on, Cocorico. That was stupendous. Thank you, Mr. Balsan. - I mean it. - Even the second time? I missed some nuances the first time. Have a seat. Did I say something wrong? She wants to leave us alone. To convert me to the cause of love. I'd like to help. So, what must I do? Do I blush? Play shy? Do I say "Oh, please do, honey"? "Yes, my love"? I like "Yes, my love.

He's not as dumb as the others. And has connections. We need a new song. Something more chic. And some money for new dresses. Good work. He drank three bottles. It's not that hard.

Like seeing me work on all fours? No. This is a very nice model. Can we speak? Sorry, I'm in a rush. It was hard to find you. No longer working nights? No. You have some free time? Hm? I have an idea. Think before refusing. How about dinner one night? Recent convert to the cause of love? Me? - You're not my type. - Good. Mademoiselle you're not paid to chit-chat. So? Okay. Very well. See you soon. Madame, if I may, I find you stunning. Not eating? I don't like it. I ate lots of it as a kid. Now it sickens me. We were wealthy. Papa speculated in wine. I thought you were an orphan. For you, all singers are. I didn't say that. Your sister told Maurice you were orphans. I repeat what I hear. She loves to tug at people's heartstrings. No, in fact I was Papa's favorite. When Mama died, he went to America. So I have a father. I'm not an orphan. Being an orphan is no crime. If it were, I'd be rotting in jail. I'm an orphan myself. - Really? - My parents died two years ago. - How sad. - A reason to rejoice. I feel alive again. We weren't speaking. Complicated family. Did they hit you? Goodness, no. Why? That would have justified my anger. In fact, I found them lacking in imagination. Deadly boring. The aunts who raised me beat me and starved me. I always hoped Papa would come back. Poor Coco. No, why? Kids like you raised with nannies and whatnot end up unhappy or retarded. Retarded, yes. I couldn't agree more. Look at me. Pathetic. I should have met you earlier. Oh, Etienne! That one I should have met much later. Too many feathers, too much makeup. Too much everything. How do you see yourself? I mean. I look like a whore. My dress for the Alcazar.

What do you mean? Maurice wants to marry me. We'll be living near Paris. I'll be a baroness. So no more singing. Look at me. Barons don't marry girls like you. You're dreaming, Adrienne. You'll sing what we rehearsed. No, I won't. He knows Mama died and Papa sells pots and pans? That you were abandoned at 9? I hope you'll forgive me. Hear my musical credo Pay on your way out I'm an electrical torpedo I'll make you sing and shout Touch me, feel the tingle Whether young or old When our currents do commingle One look and you'll be sold I'm torpedo girl See how I whirl Gents, beware You stand no prayer It's fantastic I'm electric Dear gent Your every cent will be well-spent Thank you, miss. - May I? - Of course. Ladies. Are you okay, Coco? Forget about the Alcazar. - I know someone at La Rotonde. - Enough's enough. I came to say goodbye. You're leaving? - I'm going home. - You don't live here? Thank God, no. I owed a few weeks to the army. I'm Parisian born and bred. You live in Paris? I live outside Paris, in Compi√®gne. Very well. Time for friends to part ways. I'm glad we met. Good luck, Coco. - Mr. Balsan, please. - And you are.? Gabrielle. Coco. Good boy. Coco? What are you doing here? My sister lives nearby. Surprise visit, but she's out. I remembered you lived around here. Better than the train station. Huh. And I was worried you missed me. Joseph, if you would put Coco in the floral bedroom. You're here now. I can't lock you out. After you. You like books? Rest assured, I haven't read any. I want to show you something. Coco, I want you to meet my family. Family, this is Coco. Bow down. My grandfather. Founder of the Balsan dynasty. Great man. The other Gabrielle I knew, before you. Gabrielle Balsan. No husband, no children, thank God. You look alike. How awful. You're right. Remind me to take it down. His name was Patelli√®re. A crook, a cousin. Thank God he died poor. And this is my bedroom. Don't be shy. The final hurdle. Minouche won. The race was incredible. I was very lucky. Washington, not the president had two false starts. Disqualified. That's not all. Night Flight, the favorite, ran off track. That left Minouche. She ran to the finish line. Whizzed right by. Like a rocket. Am I speaking Chinese? Here, you have to care about horses. Why aren't you ready? I'd like to stay on. What about your sister? I forgot her address. It's a bit complicated. I have guests. Some other time. I'll be discreet. Not my thing, Bluebeard locking women upstairs. You won't know I'm here. Fine. Two days. No more. You should try with a saddle. I couldn't find one. Can I learn in two days? No way. This thing is impossible. - Someone may see you. - So what? I can't let you. What do I do, kick? Come back. Pull the reins. My friends. Dinner is served. See that blonde? Jockeys have it made. Pays to be small and ugly. Monsieur's latest catch is a shrimp. The plates. Joseph, serve the champagne. Yes, sir. Slice some truffles. This napkin is dirty. It's yours. Your ring. My ring? Dirty napkins in a ring? Yes, miss. It's Bluebeard. Here to claim his due. Beware. Nothing I say can be used against me. Hm? You were magnificent. An angel of absence, seen by no one. Heard by no one. Leave me alone. Where did my little mouse hide? Up in my attic. Get off. It was so boring. You can't imagine. I'm hot. My great-grandfather's cufflinks. They give me the creeps. Help me. No. What do you mean? Hold on. Have you heard of Japan? - Japan. - Obviously. They have geishas. Ever heard of them? They tend wholly to their men. They wash and dress them. They remove their cufflinks. Like slaves. In a way. Come on, get to work. Help take off my cufflinks. Or else back to the station. Come on, give me a hand. My little geisha. Who'd abandon this poor creature? For so long? Who's my little doll? I'm big, I'm bad, I'm Bluebeard. We'll meet here afterwards. We're not together? No, we're not. I'm stuck in the boxes. Do you mind? But the lawn is fine, even better. You don't have to listen to the boring gentry-folk. I mean it. Dynamite and Magic Dream, in the third. They're my horses. I thought you disappeared. Get my letters? Why didn't you answer? I was sulking. Why are you here? I'm with Balsan. You live with him? Of course I do. I live in a castle. My own bathtub, big bed, servants fawning over me. I do nothing all day. This is wonderful. We're neighbors. How is it going with your baron? Very well. We're so in love. We live in the shadows. - He hides you? - No, we're getting married soon. Like my dress? A gift from Maurice. You must rake up mud with that train. This style is all the rage in Paris. It'll fit in perfectly up in the boxes. Pfft! Look at them. Bored out of their wits. Soon they'll kill to dine with us. I'm glad you're up. We can say goodbye. - Remember the chocolate. - In the basket. I'm off. You'll be taken to the station. - Are you okay? - Mm-hm. Drop me a line sometime. Hm? Any raspberry jam left? Give some to her. Homegrown. Delicious. Come on, my friends, let's get going. Your carriage is waiting. I won't be going. Whoa! Oh, oh, oh! I'm sorry. I wanted one last ride. He panicked. You, on a horse? I've always ridden. Riding saved me from suicide. When my aunts used to hit me I'd go out riding. You call that riding? I'm here, aren't I? You kept your boy hidden. To no avail. Ladies and gentlemen, Coco. Full of surprises. Some of them good. Gorgeous costume. You couldn't afford a riding skirt? I'd be surprised that she lasts, whatever her name is. She's charming, but lacking in frivolity. I've eaten too much. As pretty as ever. That's kind of you. Where's your jockey? Racing. Good riddance. - Already over? - We'll see. He mounts me like a chimp. Even in my dressing room. I mean it. And like all short men he's well-endowed. It's exhausting. You men are exhausting. Exhausting perhaps, but indispensable. That's true. But I may prefer women. - Liar. - You made me laugh. Young man, what do you think? What do you prefer? Don't be afraid. Go ahead. Say something. Speak up. Say what you think. Skin is skin. Well said. How did you decide this? I shut off the light. Clever. Charming. Oh! On this note, allow me to propose a little brandy and another round. These amazone saddles are impractical. She's right. You're very smart, mademoiselle. We get put on top, like cherries on a cake. He didn't give you the nicest room. Even Maud had the blue room. You're not his type. Wear a corset. Be more feminine. - This is cute. - Try it on. Give me a hand. You're prettier without it. I feel totally naked. You have a forehead, a nose, a mouth. Where are you? He can't be left alone for a second. They'll think I can't afford feathers. Not at all. With this on, how can you think? Think. Or is it just an act? Oh! Where did he find you? Keep it. What else prevents me from thinking? Go on, tell me. Don't worry, I don't bite. Get rid of all this. It's fine for a carnival. Without some adornments I'd feel poor. She's a bit primitive. I forgot to tell you. I'll be starring in "Joan of Arc. " You, playing a virgin? Yes. Leave some slack. Left, right. Get it? Now let's try to gallop. Close your right eye. - I can't. - So close the left one. - Close an eye. - Strange lesson. It's very important. Keep one eye ready in case you get mud in the other. You know, what I just told you is an old Balsan family secret. I'll become the best rider around. Could take months, if not years. So what? I should have been wary. Sent you back while I still could. What is this outfit? Where's the dress I gave you? At my window. I felt like a walking curtain. Too bad. You almost looked feminine. Disappointed? They'll think I'm a cheap date. Not bad. Dear aunt, allow me to pay my respects. Excellent, Etienne. Take this, auntie. They come less for the actress than for the tart who ruined this count or that heir. No one cares about my acting. It's relaxing, like being a tourist attraction or a monument. Ever get stage fright? Yes, but less and less. Not a good sign. Come see the play. We perform every night. Can you make me another hat? - The first was a smash hit. - Of course. By the way, bravo. For the length of your stay. You're breaking my record. Soup's on. Vintage 1882. Worth swooning over. I'm lodging a drunk. So Balsan found you in a saloon? Not at all. It was an exclusive cabaret. She has a marvelous voice. Really? I'd love to hear you. Yes. Come on, Coco, sing for us. Does anyone know "Coco"? Go on, sing. Has anyone seen Coco? Coco in Trocadero? Come on, sing. Sing. We're bored. Aww! Make an effort. Make it look like you're having fun. You're here to entertain. So sing. She's accepted your invitation. Ah! Do you know "Coco"? Or else, no more riding. Just bread and water. Can I see? Your book. Even stupid books have some truth to them. Think what the other books can teach you. I was looking for you. I knew I'd find you here. Books are meant to be read, aren't they? And horses to be mounted. Come on. Coco. Get dressed. You're elegant. You all right? Nothing scares you. What's your name? Gabrielle. But everyone calls me Coco. They call me boy. But in England, I'm Arthur Capel. The problem with nicknames is that they stick. You're stuck with it. My father used to call me Coco. He'd wake me up shouting, "cock-a-doodle-do. " It soon became Coco-doodle. And it stuck. Has any of you seen Coco? Her big number at the saloon. Nice choice, right? Her Coco, me Rico. Cocorico. Am I interrupting? I was admiring her style. Ah, her style. Don't overdo it or I'll lose my tailor. She likes dresses with no corsets shoes with no heels hats with no feathers. That's my Coco. You're right to opt for simplicity. You think so? I like things when they overflow. No meat on these bones. Stop it. No. I disagree. You're right. Her look is rather pleasant. Stick to your horse dung. - Are you sick? - No. So be nice. Get up, get dressed and come downstairs. They're all waiting. Good for them. What's wrong, Coco? Hm? I hate entertaining your degenerates. I'm tired of your mood swings. The lord of the manor is tired. What's new? Don't use that tone. - I'll speak as I please. - No! Just shut up. You're the boor. Without your money you'd lose your friends. Okay. Forget it. Come down when you're calm. I'll never calm down. What do you think? Play with your rich scions, dumb jockeys and whores. All I do is perfect my gallop and screw a drunk. The gate's open. You're not forced to stay. When people see us, I know they wonder how can this elegant woman love such a fat man? I'm not that fat. I'm losing weight at the moment. Yes, but you're not very attractive. I'm kind. You're more than that. You're understanding, talented, charming. Such is my dilemma. My lover is more like a husband. Okay, let me think. You're not shapely but you're attractive. And amusing. There's Romain Neuville. Great family. Cultivated. He'll show you around. Get you out of the stables. Who's this? But he's not much fun. I know a duke also. On the old side, but generous. I want to work. To make a living. To be an actress. You're too old to be an ing√®nue. And work, what a strange idea. You're famous. You know people. You can find me something. Something. What did you do before Balsan? Nothing. Some sewing. That's easy enough to do in Paris. Not a bad idea. You're talented. Everyone loves your straw hats. You can work at a hat shop. I don't want to. You want, but you don't know what. √âmilienne, help. Does Balsan know your plans? Hurry back to the castle. Tell him I asked you to come here. Don't tell him you want to leave. Tighter. Don't take it badly. Balsan is easygoing. You're lucky. Make the most of it. Lucky? Hungry? Muffins. Perfectly tasteless. The English adore them. Boy, what about all that coal you had me buy? Because with all due respect war is brewing. - I hope so. I'll resell it for a fortune. - Buying coal? I think Mr. Capel would do anything to become England's leading businessman. Sell my coal. I pay you well. Without his advice I'd have to work, like Montlaur. Montlaur, what a clod. Work is a vile word. Worse ways to make a living. Yes, but none more tiring. Mr. Burton is here. The breeder from Cardiff. Let's go. - Coming? - I'll join you. You'd better. Because my English is shoddy and Heart of Darkness is a horse for me. By the way, don't frighten her. She has the annoying habit of vanishing. I was afraid I'd never see you again. Aren't you happy here? You should go. It seems you're indispensable. Why won't you answer? If I had to answer every question. Do you work or just pretend to? You tell me. No one works here. Perhaps I'd like to have pretended. I had no choice. My mother was lacking a little something so my father would marry her. An aristocratic name as you say in France. I was raised by foreign hands. Don't make that face. Do I seem unhappy? Otherwise, I'd never have read a book, traveled or learned anything. But perhaps you'd like me more. It's too austere. You asked for orphan garb. What do you know? Orphans wears rags. Poor things are half naked. Rip my dress a bit. Please. You're no fun. The point is to see thighs, breasts. It's more exciting to imagine them. Stubborn as an ass. Gabrielle? You're beautiful. It's nice to see you. How do I look? Plain. Who wants to be plain? This is a disaster. - Still the boy? - Less disorienting for you. And I stuck to horse dung. Can you fix this? It's too baggy. It's to let you move about. I can feel my fat jiggling inside. I want it tighter. You'd prefer not to breathe? She has an answer for everything. Good-looking pirate. Hello. Captain John Rackham. What can I do for you? Nothing. I don't believe in your happiness. All I need is a job. You must have one with all that coal. Nothing really suited for a woman. What's the point in being a businessman? To impress you. Who do you think you are? Caught one. Caught one. Ooh! Caught one. And what a catch. Stop, Hubert. I'm not playing. That's enough. It's a dormitory here. So quiet. You were right. My orphan outfit drives them wild. Ever been in love? It never made me happy. What is it like? What do you feel? Good, bad, what? Where did you come from? What's it like to be in love? It hurts. Hurts. Hurts, doesn't it? What are you doing? I'm leaving. But the game's not over. I have no business here. You do. Balsan is counting on you. You know exactly why I'm here. You can't go off in the night. At least wait till daybreak. Goodnight, Gabrielle. Stay a bit. Why should I? I'm not used to undressing boys. Look who it is. Let's have some coffee. Where's your eye patch? I lost it in a brawl. My friend you missed a wild game of hide-and-go-seek. √âmilienne was great. She bit a servant. Seen Coco by any chance? She hid so well I never found her. Does she often disappear? No. It's rather recent. Are you fond of her? Since when do you care? Since yesterday. She's a charming companion. Very pleasant. Mind if I borrow her for two days? Like her that much? I like her. Does she want to go with you? I think so. Then be my guest. It'll clear her head. First time I've seen the sea. Showing off her silverware. Her dress is so tight, she'll split in two. These meringues on their heads. Like being in a pastry shop. I'm embarrassed for them. You're an anarchist. A good sense of distaste. You didn't make that up. It's Jules Renard. New reading habits. Tonight we'll go dancing at the casino. You don't mind being seen with me? What a strange idea. I don't have a dress for that. Make a more elegant version of this one. What about a color that's really a color? This is perfect. The fabric is even more beautiful in pink. Better suited for your complexion. Only black shows off the eyes. - I'll take this lace too. - Perfect. - Make the neckline 10 centimeters lower. - Mm-hm. And no corset. Without a corset it will be shapeless. In that case, add a belt. Do as I say. Very well. Every woman is looking at you. No, they're looking at you. You're very beautiful. I'll kidnap you as soon as I return. Not even saying goodbye? A real racecar. May I? Go ahead. Impressive. Careful, you may get hooked. How was the trip? Did you enjoy yourselves? What did you do? I thought you were a very busy man. Worried? No, not worried. I cleared my head. She may not seem it, but she's fragile. Don't play games with her. I know. Does she know? Etienne. It's up to me to tell her. Charming scene, isn't it? You with your hats, me watching. Peaceful image of a happy couple. To think you were off with another man. How was Deauville? Nice. Especially the sea. What did you do? We went dancing. He's not ashamed of me. In England, we'd dance with the Queen. I saw fishermen hauling in their nets. Men in blue with their shiny catches. I'll take you to the sea. Show you real fishing. You never leave your castle. You're wrong. I love the sea. Not so long ago I harpooned a shark from an old boat in England. I don't believe you at all. Ask him. Boy? Four years ago, to be precise. What was he like? Not handsome, but charming. Not you, him. Irresistible, of course. We were all very jealous. He stole our mistresses but always with such elegance. That's what we like about English charm. Elegance. Was he often in love? Heh-heh. No. But they were. It led to some awful scenes. He left a trail of broken hearts. France, England. Wherever there was an ocean, a sea. I don't know why but whenever he gets infatuated he takes the girl to the seaside. Strange, isn't it? You're jealous. Terribly so. Gabrielle? What are you doing here? I had to see you. Come in. So, what's so important? In "The Love Room," remember why Blanche travels the world? She loved the prince. Exactly. No, not you. I don't know what's gotten into me. I feel so stupid. I want to get married. Gabrielle. What do his folks say? He's a self-made man. You're lucky. You've never been prettier. Maurice's folks won't meet me. Not over their dead bodies. So let them die. Almost there. Careful. It's yours. It's the love of your life. Exactly. Mm-hm? I can't take Snow White. Of course you can. I'm leaving. Sorry to. I'm smiling because I let the fox into the coop. But my moodiness tires you. Don't rush into this. What's gotten into you? You used to lock me in a closet. I was a total idiot. This is your home. You'll live in England? I guess so. You don't know? There or elsewhere. For better or for worse. One way of putting it. It hurts a bit, all the same. Is that normal? You'll get over it. Of course. In fact, no. I don't want you to leave. I'm afraid. Afraid you'll be unhappy. Afraid you'll suddenly lose everything. Why do you say that? It's not for me to tell you. Boy is marrying an Englishwoman. That's nonsense. No. Marrying for money. He was born a bastard and she's rich. Her father is an English coal magnate. I'm sorry, Coco. What made me think you had become a gentleman? Coco. Open up. Open up, please. Coco. Forget what I told you. Coco. I'm sorry. Open up. Coco? Ooh. Very chic in that striped thing, darling. This is Sophie, from the Follies. She can't believe a wild child makes my hats. She's willing to spend a fortune for one. I said the chances were slim but we brought you a few models just in case. What do you think? We're in the garden. Coming? I'll join you. Take your time. Hello, Gabrielle. What's your country like? Vast, green, gray very rainy. What's on your mind? My sister. Beautiful woman. For what it's worth. She still thinks her baron will marry her. They're in love. Maybe they don't need to get married. That's usually how it works. It has nothing to do with love. Marriage is more of a social convention. So why did Balsan ask me to marry him? - You can't. - Why not? I'd achieve social status. If you marry him you give up everything. Riding horses and entertaining guests? No. An exceptional future awaits you. You and your big words. You're like no one else. You have to trust yourself. Anyway, I don't intend to marry him. I always knew I'd be no one's wife. Not even yours. It's just that sometimes I forget. My mother was an idiot. She married for love. And cried her whole life. My father cheated on her constantly. She'd sit up waiting night after night. One morning he came home and she was there in bed. In fact, she was dead. Better a mistress than a wife. The worst thing in a marriage is the couple. Are you shocked? I'm getting married. Congratulations. She's English. - The daughter of. - I know. Nothing between us will change. How wrong you are. Not playing? Here she is. I'm moving to Paris. What will you do there? Make my fortune. Can we know what great idea will make us rich and famous? I'll design hats. Excellent idea. You can do it here. I'll pay your expenses. Hats for your girlfriends won't make me rich. You can't expect to work. It makes no sense. What do you think? I think she's right. Over in England you may make women work, but here there's still a semblance of gallantry. She can't even add. She'll learn. She has no money. What about that? I'll get by. I'll borrow some. Stop filling her head with ideas. I'll marry you. It'll solve all your problems. Make all the hats you want. I'll confront my family of barbarians. I have no intention of marrying anyone. At least it's clear. The money you need I'll give it to you. I'll ruin you. I'm not so sure. So it's decided. You're abandoning me. You'll come visit. I'll miss you. Me too. What will I do without you? I'm frightened. Adrienne. Look. A gentleman. Finish up. It's so easy to undress you. See you later. Stay. √âmilienne's hats aren't ready. I'm getting sick of your hats. Leave less and you'd see me more. I may have found the house. - Where is it? - Near Cannes. Not far from the sea. I'm seeing it tomorrow. - Oysters, madame? - Mademoiselle. A two-month rental. Two months. I can't believe it. We'll fight like hell. I'll take the risk. One of your hats? The rent is on me. I thought I gave you a toy. I gave you your freedom. You could have married a celebrity instead of a lady in a dusty old castle. We'd have been happy. Because we're not? Go on, try it. - Out of the question. - I need your opinion. Get behind the wheel. Brake. Brake. You'll kill us. Not bad. You need one yourself. With a driver. Okay, I'll buy one. Let's wait. I'm not sure we have enough in the bank. We? I made that money in the bank. It's mine. They give you money because I acted as guarantor. - So I depend on you. - For the time being. Gabrielle? Starting tomorrow, I'll be negotiating with the bank. "Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. " I don't understand. You're too proud. You're going to suffer. "Bodily labor lessens the pains of the mind. This is what makes poor people happy. " "Poor people happy. " An invention of the rich. Great. Now you're ready for Nietzsche. Did you take my blue polo shirt? You know the difference between us? I'm a man. You're a woman. Men and women dress differently. Can't you leave this one alone? I can get them only in England. What's the material? Jersey. You're impossible. Help me. Or I'll never get out of here. Why the wait? Let's get going. - I have to go. - Start her up. I'm sick of seeing you leave. This time I'm coming. In that outfit? I'll be back tomorrow. Then two months, just for us. Sixty days. Sixty nights. You'll regret not taking me along. Save your saliva. I know what's coming. I got groped. Yes, you got groped. It's so dreadfully predictable. First I act like a girl then you say I'm a beast then you break something. Speaking of which, I recommend this vase. You almost broke it one night six weeks ago. It's ready and waiting. You reversed the order. Finally a change in the program. Enough. Don't exasperate me. You misbehaved. Next comes "Dirty Beast. " You've acted. Like a girl. These hats don't stay in place. Now maybe you'll overact less. As for the man in question if I held my tongue it's because I had my reasons. Theater is such a bore. Why did you cut your hair? It got in my way. You know the saying: A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life. Will you dine with me? I'd love to. Boy had a car accident. Is he in the hospital? For 60 years, Coco Chanel's creations defined the modern woman. The era's greatest celebrities adopted her style. She was the first woman to break into a man's world founding an empire which still bears her name. She never married. She worked up until her death in January, 1971. It was a Sunday, the day of rest a day she never liked.

THE REBEL GANGS WERE HIDDEN IN THE HILLS, WAITING FOR THEIR LIBERATOR, GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI. Father Costanzo is here. Bless us, Father. Well, Father Costanzo? Another Swiss regiment in Palermo, Calataregio was burned. And without calling for help because they remove the bells' clappers. Relax, Trau. Be patient a bit more because Garibaldi is coming to Sicily. - Praise the Lord! - I talked to Rosolino Pilo. One of you must reach Colonel Carini in Genoa and give precious information to the general. Today we have to row 8 miles to sea in front of Sant'Anna and wait for the postal service for Civitavecchia. - Look for Carmeniddu. - Where is he? - There! - Where is Carmeniddu? - There. Goodmorning, little sister. - You want to kill me? - You're Totuzzo! Did Father Costanzo come? - Yes. Dad wants you. - What's going on? Nothing. We got back from Piana and Dad wants Carmeniddu. Go with Father Costanzo and get precise instructions. Give it to me. Take the cape. - Bless us, Father. - Bless us, Father. You want me to be ashamed of giving you my daughter as a wife? You gave me your daughter 10 days ago. You are young, and have time! Sicily has no more time! Go say hello to Gesuzza. Go on! Excuse me, Father. Carmeniddu! I'll be back soon, Gesuzza. I have to go to town! Carmeniddu! Carmeniddu! Gesuzza! Gesuzza! Repeat how you will be identified. - You'll introduce yourself saying? - "I think I know your mother." - He'll lower his eyes and then? - "I think I know your father." He will raise his eyes to the sky. Only then you'll say who you are. - Names. - At Civitavecchia, Caffe' della Marina, Giuseppe Ricci. Carmeniddu, many soldiers are coming to town! Get the horse and take him to the square! Hey! Fire! You run over there. I'll take care of Totuzzo. Go on, young man. Listen. we have to get there! You'll see Garibaldi before us! Bless me, Father. Company, halt! Totuzzo! Totuzzo! Totuzzo. - They killed Totuzzo! - They killed him! - My son! My son! - They killed him! Keep back! - Did soldiers come to town? - Yes! A company of soldiers just arrived. - Where are you going, Carmeniddu? - Genoa. to Garibaldi. - Where? - To Genoa. by sea. By sea? How many days will you be away? Five? .Six? - Ten? - Yes, ten! But night and day you will feel my embrace around you. I'm coming back with Garibaldi! Back up! Back up! Back up! Back up! Letters in code were found on your table coming from Genoa. The captain will not arrest you if you are willing to transcribe the contents. Goodbye, son. Come on! Hurry, picciotti! Hurry with those rifles! Ready with the rifles! Lay down your arms or we'll open fire! March! Come on, hurry! Good! Feel better? Is the head still in its place? Pierre, some rum! So. which shipwreck were you saved from? Drink. I asked you what shipwreck you came. He won't answer? He understands! I don't see any reason why he should stay. Send him away! Go away. You understand? Go away! Translate. He said to go away! Hey! Where are we? Wake up, friend! We're in Civitavecchia! Order to lock up the prisoners in church because there is no other place to lock them up. Insist so that the father talks. Father, what should I answer the officer? The captain wants you to know your husband was arrested while he was trying to escape to Palermo. But he won't be hurt if you tell us where he was going. If nobody speaks before tomorrow, the captain will order a mass shooting. If I were the Pope, I wouldn't feel very serene. - There're over 60,000 French here. - There aren't even 40,000. With the last Zouaves landing, 60,000, without counting the army of the king of Naples. He is busy in Sicily. If I were the king of Naples, with 150 thousand men, I'd like to have a good time with these petty rebels. In fact, we're having fun. A letter was taken from a courier from Genoa directed to the National Society. In Monsignor Governor's office, I secretly copied a part. Do you have it here? - Yes. - Let me see. - Slowly! - The important part comes later. "There are mothers who saw their young ones torn from their bosoms their limbs, crushed by feet. Virgins sacrificed to a frenzied lust, in churches and on contaminated altars, and then put out." What did you want, young man? - I think I know your mother. - What did you say? - I think I know your mother. - Go away! - What do you want? - I think I know your mother. I think I know your father. - I am Carmelo Trau. - Giuseppe Ricci, wait for me here. - This is how things stand. - How? - This is Italy. - Yes. King Vittorio had this and this before. - And Nice and Savoy? - We're not dealing with them now. Last year he got this. Recently this was annexed. - Now he's going through Tuscany. - We know that. - What will happen, is clear. - What is that? The Piedmont fleet turns here and blocks the Austrians in Venice. The army descends from here and attacks the Pope. Garibaldi takes Naples and heads towards Rome to meet Vittorio. Be quiet! Be here at 6. You will go to the train with my brother's carriage. Vittorio Emanuele. a good man! Pleasant! Courageous, loyal! He will be a good President of the Republic. - Does the President of the Republic command everyone? - Yes. - Then he's a king. - No. A king is something else! I received this for having fought for the Roman Republic. It must be a Republic! Mazzini, and that's it! The Pope at the head of the Italian Confederation. Is His Holiness, the spiritual head of the Italians? Why shouldn't he be the political head, too? You are young, enthusiastic, intelligent. But maybe in Sicily you couldn't form a political conscience. In this confusion of ideas, only Gioberti spoke like an Italian and like a Christian. And Gioberti agrees with Garibaldi? Don't doubt it. See you soon! Goodbye! Goodbye! - Go to the front. We're all there! - I'm coming! Excuse me, boys! Hurrah for the hussars of Piacenza! Thank you! Look who's here! Nino! - You're coming to Genoa too? - Sure. With this enthusiasm! You should've seen the welcome they gave our king in Florence! It was unforgettable! Everyone at the windows, at the doors! - Only the priests. - Be quiet! Hurrah! Hurrah! And we should all be brothers! - Yes, this is not indiscretion. - Vittorio my foot! I don't know what you think, but we just got rid of Leopold II and we want another "Il"! Why is his name Vittorio? As a man, hats off, - but it is not a good reason. - Of course, of course. I repeat, I don't know how you feel, but I am for autonomy. Yes, yes! Piedmont by itself, Naples by itself, Tuscany by itself. All brothers, all Italians, but each in his own home. Certainly if an enemy peers out, if a Pope tries to interfere, we are all united. and the fight begins! But without these brand new fringed hussars. Like this. with hands, feet, clubs, with whatever one finds. You share Garibaldi's feeling? I take my hat off to Garibaldi, my young man, - but I share my own feeling. - Because Gioberti says. Gioberti! The Pope's servant! Come on! Hey, you aren't offended, are you? Listen. Have them get up immediately. His Majesty the king, in his sovereign clemency, ordered suspension of the firing squad. The captain asks you to sign a letter which expresses your unlimited recognition and devotion to His Majesty the king, and your repentance for following the outrageous instigation of the accomplices - of the scoundrel Giuseppe Garibaldi. - No! Who said "no"? You're not answering? The captain, in Palermo, will request reinstatement of the firing squad. But we are not in Palermo! We are in Genoa here! Cavour doesn't have the courage to take on the responsibility! - Cavour signs the decrees! - Even more. He advises, proposes! When the king hears the head of government saying he refuses Garibaldi for various reasons. Well, the king does not send officers, Massimo D'Azeglio forbids rifles to leave Milan. Mazzini acts as an intransigent Republican. Garibaldi gets irritated, sends us to hell and abandons the enterprise. Where is Colonel Carini? Excuse me, I come from Sicily. I must talk urgently to the Colonel. He is at the Stock Market club, withdrawing the quotas for boarding of the expedition. A ship loaded with. loaded. Ioaded with. loaded with. Loaded with. with."G"! Pledge! Pledge! Clelia, my heavens! "G"! You could have said "Garibaldini"! Garibaldini? A ship loaded with Garibaldini is so ridiculous that Miss Clelia couldn't have thought of it. The colonel is at the end of the hallway on the right. These Sicilians invaded Genoa! Soon the people of Genoa will invade Sicily! - Colonel! - I'm glad they sent you. Come. Well? Is it true they're not giving rifles to Garibaldi, and he's not leaving? Don't listen to what you hear. Wait and see what is done. The general is waiting for news that you bring from Sicily and the money from the Italians and the foreign liberals that I am gathering. - Write ten thousand. - Ten thousand? With this, we will be the favorite of the National Society which undoubtedly will prefer us for the supply of arms. We will finally sell what is left of the Marseilles Arsenal. - And in Palermo? - Three regiments of Neapolitans, two regiments of Swiss, one regiment of cavalry, and four squads of gunners, but others are arriving. How long can you resist? Father Costanzo says if Garibaldi doesn't leave right away, they'll all be dead when we get there. - How many picciotti are involved? - All those I know. Can they gather in one week? Father Costanzo says 2 days after Garibaldi comes to Sicily, the leaders will send the picciotti who are anxious to dump all the king's soldiers in the sea. - Did Rosolino Pilo come? - Yes, sir. We'll go back home in a few days! To Sicily, picciotto! Come with me. - What is it? - Colonel Carini. - At the end of the hallway. No. I'm going out again. Here, Colonel. Very generous! It is a pleasant duty towards this beautiful Italy that hosts me. The exiled Sicilian and the National Society are particularly grateful to you. Your noble disinterest is witness once again of the sincere and traditional friendship between our countries. - What is it? - Garibaldi isn't going to Sicily. What? He wrote to the Rubattino company asking to board for Caprera. Crispi sent us to advise all leaders. Excuse me. You said Garibaldi is not leaving? No. We'll see. Meanwhile, you wait for me at the Society. There is merriment in the Piedmont houses. They are celebrating Garibaldi's departure for Caprera. These Piedmont brothers sing well. With their women. peaceful homes. assured bread. Garibaldi isn't taking us to Sicily anymore. So we won't go back to Sicily again. Those Bourbon sons of bitches are killing us, burning us, killing down south. And these Piedmont brothers sing that Italy has awakened! Open! - Now the good part comes. - We'll dance now! What is going on? We are Sicilian! - Is this the time to sing? - Yes! Now that the news has come! Picciotti! Garibaldi has decided to come to Sicily! - Did he decide, Carini? - Yes, a half hour ago. - We just found out! - Now let's stop, boys! This is a happy moment! It is the moment of Italy's union! - Where are we going, picciotto? - To Sicily, to our home! - You are so handsome, my son. - Don't cry, Mom. - My companions are here. - No, no. Look. I bought you something to eat tonight. and an egg for tomorrow. Remember it. I'm taking something of you with me. Goodbye, Mom. If that saintly woman of your mother was here. - You are bastards! - You're coming to Sicily too? - Yes. - I'm stupid. I thought you were against Vittorio. Right. I thought so too. - Garibaldi! - Garibaldi? - Pleasant chap! - Which is he? - The one coming out alone from Villa Spinola! Go there. Oh! You! Yes. You know Garibaldi's motto is, "Italy and Vittorio Emanuele"? But. I'd think about it a bit now. No! Remember on the train, for having trought too much, we let those Germans get our seats. Believe me. The time for arguing is over. The time to act has come! He taught us that! See him? He said the Garibaldini wouldn't have left, and now he is there enjoying the spectacle. - Shall we go? - Yes! How many are you? You should be at least eight! Can't you get in by yourself? Company, line up! Forward, march! My child, Garibaldi is here! My son! My son! - What is going on? - Garibaldi is here! The soldiers got scared and left! Open the doors. Garibaldi is here! Here! You too. Run! Take this! Now Father Costanzo will talk to you! My children! God had mercy on us! The day of our freedom in Christ may be near! Garibaldi is marching on Salemi! Italian soldiers landed in Marsala yesterday! With the Italian soldiers, the great Sicilian patriots returned! La Masa, Carini, Crispi, everyone! Our exiled brothers! They're about 4,000. They're going to Salemi through Alcamo. We will cut through the San Giuseppe Jato caves. CONSIDERING THAT IN WAR IT IS NECESSARY THAT CIVILIAN AND MILITARY POWERS BE CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF ONE MAN, I TAKE OVER, DICTATORSHIP OF SICILY IN THE NAME, OF VITTORIO EMANUELE KING OF ITALY. GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI Hey! Stop! Hey! I said stop! Boy, were you trying to run away? There, behind those mountains, is my wife. Oh! Good to know. You're right. These things don't shoot. Tomorrow morning I'll be back. You've my word of honor. - Are you kidding? - I haven't seen her in a month. Lucky you. You haven't seen her in a month. Who knows how many months will go by before I see mine, and my children. They are beyond those other mountains. Then there's the plain, the sea, another plain, another mountain. Before dawn, I'll be here, my word of honor. You mean in one night you'll walk there and back? I can find a horse here whenever I want. Where are your companions? There. If the Bourbons attack tonight, only the Piedmont people should be killed for Sicily? - Were you running away? - Never. - Well? I wanted to see my wife. Our general will never see his wife again. And he didn't lose her to defend his home, but to defend the home of his brothers. His country, son. Come with me. By behaving like this, you didn't just risk your life. What about the life of your companions down there? Give him the rifle. Go! You're not moving from here. Gesuzza! Gesuzza! Carmeniddu! Carmeniddu! Gesuzza! - Gesuzza! - Carmeniddu! Sentry, alert! Sentry, alert! I am alert. Alert, sentry! I am alert! Alert, sentry! - Carmeniddu. - My Gesuzza. Look how clear it is. Home is down there, Carmeniddu. If you don't fight, Garibaldi won't win? - Oh, come on! - So? Let's go, Carmeli'. There are no more soldiers in town. If the Bourbons attack us tonight, only the Piedmont men should get killed for Sicily? That, never, Carmeli'. Did you know that General Garibaldi's wife died to defend her brothers' house. That is, her country? Poor man. You must leave me for a few days because I want to stay with you my whole life. It's impossible if we don't push the king's soldiers into the sea. Right, sweetheart? Right, Carmeli'. I won't leave you again. I am going to war with you. - I am so happy, Carmeli'. - You are beautiful! Vlth company, halt! I'll prepare another one for you. Gesuzza, Santa is sick. Come to her! - Santa? Where is she? - Come. - Men, the enemy is facing us! - Where? Beyond the hills, in Calatafimi! - Where is Calatafimi? - There! - Dad! - From now on, stay close to me. - How many are there? - About 4,000. It'll be great fun! 11 years ago, in Velletri, Garibaldi. we were a fistful. had us see the backs of 30,000 men running. - these Neapolitan priests! - Priests? Didn't they come to defend the Pope? Do you have your ammunition? And you? Everyone? The Genoa Carabinieri, at the head. Ready to attack! Forward, Mosto company. After that, Carini battalion. 8th to the right, 9th to the left, 5th and 6th to the center. Half in surround and half forward. Come on, Genoa! Hurry! Stay low! Come on! Stay low! Orders from the general to bring the first group forward. Understand? Orders from the general. - Those there will see it too! - The general sent him on purpose. He hopes they realize they are Italians too. - Is that the Italian flag? - Yes. How lovely! - First rows have orders to shoot! - No! General's orders. Italians are great! They run after the first shots. No, it's a manoeuvre. They're trying to bring us towards the cannons. They hit two of the Bergamo squad. Let's go, picciotti! Third company, long live Italy! Third company! Leave me alone. I want to go with them! Father! Father! Do you see the priests? Forward! Long live Italy! They attacked the 4th terrace. The major requests the cavalry from the general to charge the enemy from behind. Impossible. The cavalry stays in its strategic position protecting the retreat. Bixio went to ask the general to retreat. - Boys, the general! - The general! Come on, boys! Come on, boys! Come on. One last effort! Then it will be over! We either make Italy here or we die! 3rd company! - 5th company! - 5th company! Carmeniddu! Mom! Stay here, Mom. Don't leave, Mom. - Carmeniddu! - My Gesuzza! Lovely Gesuzza! Garibaldi said we made Italy! Garibaldi said we made Italy! We made Italy, Gesuzza!

Meanwhile.</i> <i>.the Heike attempt to bring</i> <i>renewed prosperity to Kyoto.</i> <i>Yet each night, there is the</i> <i>continuing slaughter of Heike troops.</i> <i>.bringing with it the fear that</i> <i>a demon has been unleashed.</i> What is this? Ominous stars approach and there are two of them. No! Great misfortune shall be brought upon us. Oh revered spirits of power, come to me and speak. The demon is growing. We must act before it is too late! This is Gojoe Bridge. No mortal shall pass! <i>Gojoe Bridge</i> <i>GOJOE</i> There he goes! Get him! He's going into the ravine, cut him off! All right! Don't let him escape! Move! Move! Out of the way! We've got you now, Musashibo Benkei! You. You have betrayed our brethren, and stole the precious Demon Slayer. You shameless wretch! Stole? I've only borrowed it. I'll give it back when I'm done with it. What do you take us for? What is this? Order! Order! Order! This instant! Show some respect! Fools! Sheath your weapons, now! Think of where you are! You've come. Ajari. I knew that you would. It's been so long. I remember the day you saved me, Ajari. Or should I call you "Holy Priest"? People worship you, calling you the savior of the world. Call me whatever you'd like. I am just a monk who loves nature. Seven years. Time goes by so quickly. Your brute nature seems tempered by these years of devotion. But you haven't returned to engage me in nostalgia. With so many mortal enemies in Kyoto and that sword you carry. Your must have grave business indeed. Ajari. I had a vision while meditating on sacred Mt. Hiko. Our protector, Acalanatha, rose above me. He revealed to me my destiny. I am to seek enlightenment by slaying the demon with two faces. At first I didn't understand. When I heard about the Demon of Gojoe Bridge who seeks to slay one thousand souls I knew this must be the demon of Acalanatha's revelation. No. Benkei. You must not seek enlightenment by the sword. Would you call Acalanatha's revelation a mere delusion? Witness the mark, which rose on my flesh since that day. It is the will of Acalanatha! Ajari. I came first to you, to share the joy of revelation. I am not the butcher of my former days. Seven years have I spent in devotion. Now I've finally received my calling. I will slay the Demon of Gojoe Bridge and Acalanatha will rise to deliver me. Please await the joyous news. This is Gojoe Bridge. No mortal shall pass. It's me. You shameless fool. You won't live long. Damned demons, they always get all the good stuff. Oh, a monk. What are you doing here? What does it look like? It looks like you're a damned scavenger. You wouldn't be here if you weren't damned yourself. Yet another monk fighting demons for the Heike? Give it up, holy man. Your eyes will melt if you look at a real demon. They come across Gojoe? Not in the daylight. Demons only come out at night. Then I'll wait for nightfall. Thank you. Rest in peace, rest in peace. It's not gonna work. Hey! How dare you! Master Ajari gave this to me. Isn't that Benkei? Benkei? There, behind Tetsukichi. It is, it's Benkei. Couldn't be. Where? You're right, it's Benkei. And he's coming towards us! Keep him out! Is that the infamous Benkei? That's him all right. Hey! Where are you going? I await nightfall. I must report to the Leader. What? Benkei has returned? Yes. So he is still alive. Yes, he still should be near our territory. Good. I've been waiting for this day. Prepare for an attack! No doubt. This is the night for a change in fortune. And for the demon? For him too, tonight is a turning point. We can finally accomplish General Kiyomori's secret mission. The honor of the Heike Clan is in your hands. This is your hour to shine. This is Gojoe Bridge. No mortal shall pass. There he is! I've finally found you, Benkei. Tankai. What's with your clothing? You look like a beggar. You haven't changed. I haven't forgotten about our unfinished business, either. Let's settle this once and for all! I'd like to avoid a fight with you now. It won't be that easy. In order to be the leader of the Shirakawa Clan one must be the fiercest warrior. But I wouldn't be the fiercest if you were alive, now would I? I don't care about leading a clan. My life belongs to Buddha now. Don't make me laugh! Why do you carry a sword, then? Does Buddha teach you to slay, huh? I told you. I don't have time for you now. Draw your sword, Benkei! Get him! Let fly! Get him! Get him! Hold it! Hold your arms! It's no use. Damn, you weasel! Damned demon. I, Tairano Tadanori, vow to kill you or die trying. It's the demon! Who are you? Out of my way! Where is the demon? He's mine! Get out of my way! Out of my way! Go! I am the archer Kudokumaru and the demon is mine! What is this. demon of Gojoe? It even felled the master archer, Kudokumaru. It's all because you were mistaken about the demon's fate. His fate has changed indeed. Have we no longer any means left to fight him with? There is one. The monk who joined last night's battle. The demon remains in the capital for him. So we still have a chance? If we want to understand the demon, we need to first find the monk. <i>Hachiman Daibosatsu</i> Prince Shanao. Your mastery of the sword knows no equal. You have reached manhood and your time here is finished. We must retire from Kyoto, join our forces in the East, and plan our assault on the capital. It is time to take on your new name one befitting the rightful heir of the Genji Clan. I, therefore, humbly present your name in manhood. Kurou Yoshitsune of the noble Genji. <i>Kurou Yoshitsune Minamoto</i> A name fit for a King who regained his family's honor. Trusted priest of Shoshinbo. Mightn't we delay our departure? But time is of the essence! Take young Keshimaru here if you like. It is the duty of a decoy. What are you saying? Our primary duty is the restoration of the Genji Clan? The intruder at the bridge was the infamous Musashibo Benkei. They say that he was born fully formed, with teeth and hair fully grown feared even by his own mother as a demon. Born a demon? Any relation to the Heike? He is without ally or affiliation. Then why should such a being seek to slay me? I do not know. In any event, he is not a formally trained warrior and is certainly no match for Your Highness. Goujin. Sir. Did you not sense his primal energy? Keshimaru, how about you? The honor of the Genji Clan will be restored. Musashibo Benkei. First I must engage the power of this natural born demon. Preparing for a war? You followed me, bastard! Tetsukichi. It is said that you were once a great swordsmith. Magnificent sword. How'd a monk like you get a blade like this? This thing probably could slay a demon. Here. My services are expensive. Where is he? How the hell should I know? You knew that the Gojoe Demon was actually a man, didn't you? Yeah. You can tell by the incision. He's quite a swordsman. And just like me, he's collecting arms. How do you know? There's a guy who saw them. He has nearly a thousand swords. And did this guy say where they were? If I knew that, I wouldn't be sitting here chatting with you. Then I'll have to go look for him myself. I'll kill him, and take the 1,000 swords for myself. Hold it! As payment for my services you owe me his swords. We are right around here. Across the river is Toribeno. And beyond that is Omaga Forest. There are many hidden mines deep in the forest. People don't go that deep in the forest so the demons must be hiding somewhere around there. But it is also called the Devil's forest. If you aren't careful, you can lose your mind. The guy who saw the thousand swords of the demon, never returned from the forest. Where are you going? To Omaga Forest. But it's dark. I can see. Wait a minute, that's not what you promised. I promised you nothing. Even in death our souls may not rest until Kyoto is free of this pestilence. What's the matter? As I suspected, this woman is possessed by evil spirits. The child she bears is a demon! Kill them! Quickly! Kill them now! Before it's born. Kill it now, before it's too late! Kill them! You must kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Benkei! Quickly! Kill them! Kill them! Do not interrupt! Foul spirits! Release this woman's soul, and come out of her immediately! What's wrong? Boil water! Huh? Boil water! Hurry up and have him already! Once more. Push! Keep pushing, again! No use saving them. They will be possessed again, and die anyway. Hang in there. You mustn't listen to the voice of demons. If you hear his voice, chant sutras like this. Namufudou sama, Namufudou sama. Namufudou sama. Namufudou sama. Namufudou sama, Namufudou sama. That's right. Tetsukichi. You used to make swords for warrior monks, didn't you? Why do you scavenge others' swords now? I couldn't stand seeing my work go to "holy" men hypocrites like you who are devout in word, yet murderous in deed. I don't kill men, just demons. What's that, monk logic? I heard you were a monstrous villain seven years ago. Is it true that you killed women and children? Yes. You miserable son of a bitch. Yeah. You kill demons. I take their swords. Don't forget our deal. Toribeno is a land of the dead. Nothing to take. You really are a scavenger. From here on is the Omaga Forest. What's the matter? I feel the presence of evil spirits. Rub that on your body. Someone is approaching. Be still. I've felt this presence before. It is powerful. Spirits of the wood, I banish you! Follow me. Hey. Hey! Damn it. Monk, help me. What do you think you're doing? Offering your blood to Dahl. Dahl? A spirit of the forest. Spirits of the wood, I banish you! Um, abracadabra. Mumbo jumbo, abracadabra. Strange. We should be protected. What could be stopping us? Hey! Is it Dahl? No. What's wrong, Benkei? Has the Devil's Wood revealed your clouded mind? Slay them, or they will become demons. Prince Shanao! I beg of you! Never match your energy with another's! Prince Shanao! You must stop! Must we kill them all? But General Kiyomori, we must cut the Genji bloodline. I beg of you, spare these little ones. Slay them all or they will become demons with a terrible power to rise against the Heike Clan. Hey! What's wrong? Hey! Snap out of it! Benkei! Hey. Hey! Fight them, Benkei! Musashibo Benkei! I place you under arrest for obstructing justice at Gojoe Bridge. Seize them! Benkei, do something! Musashibo Benkei. So easily taken for one with such a monstrous reputation. What do you know of Shanao? That he is the son Yoshitomo, the leader of the vanquished Genji Clan? That he attacks us, though we spared him death as an infant? Not at all an unstoppable Demon warrior just a punk, not even come of age making a contest for the souls of 1,000 Heike warriors. Yet, this "punk" threatens the very future of the Heike Clan. You are right. But if word of this gets out, our authority will be broken. And rogue Genji warriors from the East will descend upon Kyoto. Then all will be buried in darkness. What do you want from me? We need that spiritual power of yours. Join us, and restore order to Kyoto under our protection. Together, let us defeat Shanao. Impossible. I am a monk now. That is all the more reason for you to help us. Your duty is to put demons in their places. Use your powers, and put this demon to rest. I am no man's servant. Who do you think you're fooling, Benkei? You bear the Demon Slayer yet will not kill a demon? I can read your heart. I know of your demon blood, and I can sense your destiny. I am not a demon. I am a man. A man who claims devotion while feigning ignorance of his own fate. Enough. It's settled then. Let us put your demon calling power to the test. How's the baby? Tetsukichi. Here. He's too quiet. Are you sure he isn't dead? Idiot! Don't mind him. Hey guys! Are you alive? Hey! Did you hear the news? Benkei's been arrested by the police. We already know. That damned monk will be finally beheaded. Actually, he isn't going to be beheaded. Why do you look so happy, then? Because he will be crucified at the edge of Omaga forest. What? Is that true? That's worse than being beheaded! Ooh, scary! And we, the Shirakawa Clan, were chosen to carry out the execution. It's a direct order from Chief Tadanori. If things go well, we may gain the support of General Kiyomori. Then we won't have to sleep in this dump! Hey, are you alive? Thanks. Well, everyone, I'm off! The sun is shining upon us! Hey! Huh? You think Tankai will let him die so easily? You're right. He's going to fight Benkei. I won. Hey, what are you doing? Who are you betting on? Of course. I bet on Tankai. I'm going to bet on Benkei. Benkei. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. Tankai. You guys don't know how to gamble. I'm betting on Benkei. I'll go see it for myself. Hey! Where are you going? Give it back! Musashibo Benkei! Die! Let go! Hey punk, who sent you? No one sent me! What? Then why are you after my life? To avenge my mother's death! You attacked her at Tsugizakura shrine in Kumano. And you impregnated her with me! She gave birth to me, so that I could send you to hell. So are you my. You are already dead. Had a nightmare? We've done our job. Benkei's been delivered to the Devil's Wood. Just as Security Chief Tadanori asked. But now I'm going to do whatever I want. Pick your weapon. I'm not fighting with anyone. You coward! Tankai. Do you still not understand? We are all hostages here, completely surrounded and a terrible darkness is approaching. Flee while you still can! Spare me your cheap ruses, and defend your honor! What's this? The moon invades the sun? The sun is eaten by the moon. An apparition that appears once every 100 years. No! Turn not to the darkness! Nor the demon's will! <i>Curses upon the Heike</i> Where are they? Over there! Where are they? Don't panic! Mind your aim! Don't panic! Let fly now! The fate of the entire Heike Clan rests on the fate of two demons? They've come. They are here! They're just punks. Hold your ground! Damn demon! Violated. Torn asunder. All is for naught. We are undone. We've been betrayed. Attack! Who in hell are you? Stop! It's the Gojoe Demon. Leave him to me. Gojoe Demon! Prepare to die! The demon's killed our Leader! Shanao. Why? One thousand souls? Come for me. Why do you flee? To quiet your demon spirit. No. It is you whose spirit needs rest. Why should a demon like you be so indecisive? Reveal to me your true demon self. It's time you died on the Demon Slayer! Alas. Acalanatha's revelation was a delusion. Begin your training all over again. What are you doing? Have you lost your royal mind? I will now begin nine days of fasting. I will challenge the Holy Priest, Ajari. What! I will challenge the power of Buddha. Prince Shanao! Have you forgotten the shame of your father's execution? You are the symbol of the Genji family. The physical form of Genji vengeance! This is not the time for self-abnegation! I have passed the state of killing for revenge. I sense something new. But something is lacking. Still lacking. Are you running away? What happened to slaying demons? Damned monk! What brought you here? I came to report something. I see. What is it? I realized that gods are all incompetent. And I have received enlightenment. I see. How will the gods you believe in save this chaotic world? How? Don't try to evade my question. Or do you acknowledge the fact that you are helpless? Indeed. I am just a monk, who loves nature. Then I will tell you. The gods people believe in are mere illusions. The one who can save the world from devastation is the true god. The true god has the true power. I have gained the true power. I have gained the power to rule. I pray to no god. I see. The only god I will trust is my power. The Devil of Kurama, Vaisravana, Sahasrabhuja. I have received their powers. And tonight, I will take yours. I cannot help you. It is no use killing me. Are you begging for your life? Do you not understand? I will not stop you from killing me. However, I will not be able to help you. Shanao! I can tell that you are a man of great spiritual dimension. I am but an undeserving soul, who has come to this place of deliverance out of the desire to follow in the footsteps of the godhead. Yet, my devotion has weakened. I cannot, and yet I must die in pious immolation. You are a blessing, sent to set me ablaze. I am prepared, anointed with oils. Please help deliver me. I am ready to receive the flames. I cannot. Please find another way. No, this is the only solution. It is my last request. Release me from my hesitation! Offer me your strength! Let go. I have no such power, I can't release another from their misery. Help me! Deliver me! I beg of you! Benkei, why do you flee? I am not an illusion. However, the path that you pretend to is one. Your enlightenment will not come that way. Shanao! Return to me, Benkei. Return to Kyoto and challenge me. No one will cloud your decision anymore. No one will cloud your decision anymore. Come and challenge me. Ajari! It's the end! It's the end! It's the end! Yeah? Why not? Why not! Hey. Huh? Whatever happened to Benkei? Damned monk's long gone. And that talk about slaying the demon. Benkei just stirred him up and dropped him in our laps. That's about the size of it. I guess I'll have to steal those 1,000 swords myself after all. It's the end and who cares? The world has come to an end when a holy monk like him gets slain. I told you, this is useless. Let's burn it. We're outta here! So long, Kyoto! Burn, burn, let it all burn! Who cares! Burn! Yeah! Burn! Burn! Burn, let it all burn! Burn! Well if it ain't the police! Something the matter? It's the end of the world and we don't care! You got a problem with that? What are you doing? Fire! What are you doing here? Everyone's dead and you're the last person I want to see. Perfect place for a 'damned scavenger,' huh? Hope you like it. Because this hell is all your doing. Amazing, huh? You monks and your magic powers. Give it up. I said, it's hopeless. What's so special about being alive anyway? Hey. I don't care whether you're after monks or demons but cut this in-between crap. This is the end. What? This will be my last deed as a monk. Tough little brat. Tetsukichi. Where is the Demon Slayer? Prince Shanao. Benkei has begun to move. I could feel it. He has finally realized what he really is. Tonight, your escorts come to take you to our stronghold. I would gladly lay down my life to save yours. Shoshinbo. Do not fret so. After my duel, we will join our forces in the East. And I will assume my appointed name, "Yoshitsune Genji." You honor me with your acceptance. And the duel, where will it be? Where else but Gojoe. Just stay down and watch the kid. That's my sword! That's my sword! You still don't understand? The wrath of the heavens are upon him! Now I'll show you the fury of a real demon. Prince Shanao! Old man. Old man! Where are you? Old man? Come on! Come on! Hey! You tough little brat! Comrade Shoshinbo! What is the meaning of this? What is happening on Gojoe? There was an incident with the Heike but now everything has been made clear. Gentlemen. The lost son of Yoshitomo, Prince Shanao! Your Highness. Yes. Hereafter, I shall rule as Yoshitsune Genji. And here with His Highness the most famous warrior monk in Kyoto, now aligned to the Genji Clan. Musashibo Benkei. Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! Where are you? Benkei! Benkei! Where are you? Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! Benkei! <i>The end</i> The Japanese ambassador just arrived. He should be up shortly. Thank you. The Japanese are stalling, Henry. You know that. When Nomura took over as ambassador. . . . . . I had some hopes of settling our differences. But our meetings so far have been unproductive. He brings me proposals, I offer compromises. He brings me counterproposals, and so on. I tell you, Henry, Nomura was sent here to buy time. That's what he's doing, at our expense. The president thinks he's. . . . . .a man we can trust and deal with. Mr. Ambassador, we meet again. It is always a pleasure. I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department. Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Ambassador. I do hope, Mr. Stimson. . . . . .your presence here doesn't indicate anything ominous. Of course not, Mr. Nomura. Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down? Thank you. Well, since our last talk a week ago. . . . . .I have received a certain. . . . . .shall we say. . . . . .question from my government. . . . . .to put to you to clarify certain matters. There it is. This machine lets us intercept every word between Tokyo. . . . . .and all Japanese embassies. The coded material is fed into that machine. It goes round and round in there. . . . . .and comes out here, decoded in Japanese. All we have to do is translate it. We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy. . . . . .right here in Washington. No wonder you decided to call it ''Operation Magic. '' -The latest intercept, sir. -Thank you. Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific. As long as we're sharing this assignment. . . . . .take a look at this. Behold the 1 2 apostles. The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts. Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list. No, and not one of our overseas commanders. Stand by. Execute. Look at that entrance to the harbor. Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet. You know as well as l do, this harbor is a mousetrap. Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs. I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt. We're expected to obey orders. We're also expected to exercise our own good judgment. I didn't ask for the job. Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit. . . . . .to worry about the security of the fleet. The British, flying some old biplanes. . . . . .torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships at Taranto. Harbor very much like this one. I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here. Why not? A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges. . . . . .to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off. I know, and Pearl is only 40 feet deep. I'm still worried, Kim. Ten-hut! Do the planes have to be parked like that? Way at the edge of the field. Standard dispersal procedure, general. In case of enemy air attack. There are 1 30,000 Japanese on this island. Our main problem is sabotage. It'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night. . . . . .and blow up every one of them if they're left out there. Make a note, Fielder, we'll have to make changes. Ten-hut. Admiral Halsey's here to see you. Send him in, please. Blast me, break me, court marshal me, draw and quarter me. . . . . .if you think they're gonna send my ships. . . . . .on convoy duty in the Atlantic. Kim, I think they've gone nuts in Washington. How will I fight a task force if they send. . . . . .my ships to the Atlantic? That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific. What are we, a fighting fleet or these toy boats here. . . . . .so the Japs can buy them at Christmas? All right, Bill, now ease it off. It's not just you. They asked for some of our tankers too. How do they expect to feed these wagons. . . . . .parked out here on this land-locked duck pond? You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea? I was. Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here. I'm gonna do everything l can, Bill. Even go to the president. By God, l knew there was at least one man. . . . . .in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts. And we go on to say, ''It should be noted that Japan. . . . . .has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war. We believe it possible that a fast-rated. . . . . .Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning. . . . . .from our intelligence service. The most favorable time to the enemy would be dawn. He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers. . . . . .strike on a weekend. -We recommend that the Air Corps--'' -l read it. Yes, sir. I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in. These reports are very useful to General Short and myself. General Martin, you don't pull any punches do you? ''We recommend that the Air Corps. . . . . .maintain a thorough 360-degree search. . . . . .of the Hawaiian area during daylight. This will require a force of 180 B-17 airplanes. '' We can't search the sea approaches. . . . . .unless we have the planes, sir. One hundred and eighty B-1 7s? For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States. It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there. Squadron from the Enterprise. Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men. Wish we had more like him. Makes the most of what he's got. Doesn't keep asking for the moon. Well, not one bomb anywhere in the target for the past hour. Your pilots can see it, I suppose. -Who's next? -It¬ís Anderson, sir. Now, that's more like it. -Maybe your boys finally get it. -I hope so, sir. Who's next? Lieutenant Dickenson. Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me. . . . . .he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle. Yes, sir. Ten-hut. -Carry on. -Carry on. This it? Yes, sir. Our new radar. It¬ís a remarkable scientific achievement. . . . . .capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air. . . . . .and at quite a range. Now, listen colonel, as you know, we're short on patrol planes. We're gonna have to rely on this. . . . . .thing to detect the enemy. General, radar should do the job. What's it doing here, not set up? We're about to truck it up that mountain. That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post. At that height, we'd be clear of all interference. Obviously. But, sir, we can't get permission to put her up there. Permission? From the National Park Service Department of Interior. See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park. The Hawaiian National Park? Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation Society is raising hell too. And we can't get permission? No, sir. Not unless we want to fight them. Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them. -Now you make a note of that, Fielder. -Yes, sir. Wildlife Preservation Society. It¬ís no use, Hal. I spoke to General Miles. He took it up with General Marshall. The order stands. The president is off the ultra list. Incredible. Withholding information from the president. Security found a copy of an intercept in a waste basket at the White House. Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president. Does anyone trust anyone anymore? -Do you even trust your own wife? -Do you? Come to think of it, l believe l do. Part two of No. 1 390, colonel. Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin. Thank you, Miss Cave. The Japanese are moving south to occupy French lndo-China. -This is big trouble. -Yeah. Well, ultra list or not. . . . . .someone has to tell the president about this one. ''Therefore, we will impose a full embargo. . . . . .on all trade with Japan. We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan. . . . . .but you get this information. . . . . .so you may take appropriate precautionary measures. '' ''Appropriate precautionary measures. '' What the hell does that mean? Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark. Until we know how the Japanese will react, we're not gonna take chances. -We go on full alert. -Yes, sir. Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action. Why send a warning at all? Damn it. Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story? I¬íd sooner form my own opinion. ''Don't anticipate hostile action. '' Well, all right, we'll go ahead. Increase air and sub patrols, alert senior commanders. Maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function. Kaminsky. This is Captain Earle. Going on full alert. Yes, captain. We're going on full alert. Notify all ship, sub and air patrols. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing? Carrying out orders. General Short's concern is sabotage. All aircraft not ready for flight from now on. . . . . .will be parked in the center. . . . . .so they can be kept under guard. Suppose there's an air raid. They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames. I¬ím sorry. General's orders. It¬ís not an ideal radar sight, but at least we got a permit. Let's get the other units working. Easier said than done. What do you mean? We have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters. That means training men to operate an information center. . . . . .so they know what to do with the information. Take it easy, Murph. -You'll figure it out. -Yeah, I¬íll figure it out. Don't just stand there. You know how to operate this thing. We know the theory. Let's put that theory into practice. -Switch on. -Yes, sir. Stay put and keep watching the screen. In two hours, close down. I¬íll send a truck to pick you up. Excuse me, sir, but what are we watching for? Anything unusual. Any large blip coming from the sea. Colonel, if we do spot something, what do we do? Report it to headquarters, damn it. -How, sir? -What? We haven't got a telephone, sir. There's a gas station a mile down the road. They must have a phone. We got 1 83 combat planes on this base, general. The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon. . . . . .could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade. Don't blame me. General Short gave the order. Come in. -Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch. -Okay, send them in. You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa. Yes, sir. What are our orders when we get there? Just sit tight. Listen for the phone. That's all. Yes, sir. Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields. We send those two up there, two more here. Only way l know to disperse a few of the planes. If I¬íd get away with it, I¬íd send all to the neighbor islands. -You know why we're being transferred. -Them poker games. Been winning too often. Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the general. Nomura has offered his resignation several times. But Tokyo won't let him quit. Instead they're sending a second ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out. Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good? Well, I doubt it, Frank. He's hardly the most tactful choice. When he was ambassador in Berlin. . . . . .he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan. -You sick or something? -No. I¬íve been piecing together this batch of new intercepts. A frightening picture is taking shape. Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government. . . . . .to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America. -You remember that? -Yeah. Now, according to this latest intercept. . . . . .Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us. . . . . .no later than November 29. . . . . .after which, and I quote. . . . . . ''Things are automatically going to happen. '' Look at this intelligence report from the British. Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort. . . . . .were sighted off Formosa, heading south. We've been monitoring their fleet. Most of it seems to be on home waters. I¬ím not so sure. I¬ím betting they're going to attack us. Japan is going to attack us. The 29th is only four days off. The 30th is on a Sunday. We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November. The pieces fit together. But can you prove it? No. But I¬ím convinced I¬ím right. Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall. General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir. Then get me the secretary of war. I¬íve got the evidence, Al. And I¬ím gonna make the brass around here admit I¬ím right. Bratton's analysis makes sense. His facts are undeniable. Henry, I¬ím washing my hands of the whole matter. From now on, it's in your hands. . . . . .and in those of the Navy department. I¬íll call the president. A message declaring a full alert will be sent out. General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this. Before he left to attend maneuvers. . . . . .he made out this alert order. Read this back to me. ''Japanese future action unpredictable. But hostile action possible at any moment. If hostilities cannot be avoided. . . . . .the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act. '' Read that again. ''If hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires. . . . . .that Japan commit the first overt act. This shouldn't be construed as restricting you. . . . . .to a course of action jeopardizing your defense. Prior to hostile Japanese action. . . . . .you are directed to undertake reconnaissance. . . . . .and other measures as you deem necessary. These measures should be carried out. . . . . .so as not to alarm the civil population. . . . . .or disclose intent. By order of General George C. Marshall. '' Not to alarm the civil population. What do you make of it? If you ask me, sir, it's double talk. But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk. -We're going on alert. -Again? But the men are confused. So many alerts. -Damn it, unconfuse them. -Yes, sir. ''Japanese forces may attack the Philippines. . . . . .Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo. This dispatch is to be considered a war warning. '' Well, there it is, gentlemen. You now have as much information as I do. That's the second warning in three days. ''Japanese forces may attack the Philippines. . . . . .Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo. '' They don't mention us. That's correct. I think it should be considered significant. Well, gentlemen. . . . . .we have a job to do. Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway. And another squadron to Wake. When can you sail? Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning. I¬íll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington. Hurry things along, John. I want you out there to probe. I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon. I want a report on any sign of hostile ships. Understood. Do you want battleships along? Hell, no. They're too slow. If we're gonna probe, let's probe. We don't want anything holding us up. You're right, but I¬ím not ready to commit them myself. Not until l know when and where. Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone? No, it's too risky. I¬íll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away. Get out. Get back as soon as you can. I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover. -Let's get going. -Yes, sir. Kimmel. Level with me. I want a clear directive. If l run into a Jap ship, what action do I take? Use your common sense. That's the best damn order l ever had. If I see so much as a sampan there. . . . . . I¬íll blow it out of the water. What is it this time, getting me over here? Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by. . . . . .for a very long message in 14 parts. Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week. We're not doing that again, are we? You should see this. It¬ís the latest report on those Japanese troop transports. Remember those troop ships? They're still heading south with an escort. . . . . .only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya. What about their aircraft carriers? We don't know. Intelligence was keeping track of them until recently. Now we've lost them. Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds. Where do you think l have been the past week, night and day? I am still convinced they're going to attack us. What can we do that we aren't doing already? I don't know about you, but l know what I¬ím gonna do. Where is everybody? Oh, it's past 1 2, sir. They've already gone. -Get them back. -On the weekend? Yes, on the weekend. This completes 1 3 parts? Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning. I wonder why. It¬ís almost 9. Harry, I¬ím going to make the rounds with what we have here. Thank God the president's back on the list. Have Brotherhood call me when the missing part is in. Right. You're late. -Well, l was-- -Please, take me to the White House. If you told me we were invited to the White House, l would've dressed. You know Mrs. Roosevelt. She's informal personally, but a stickler for protocol-- Darling, will you shut up and drive? Well? Captain Wilkinson's. Did you see the president? No, l saw Harry Hopkins. And did he read the, whatever it is? No, he doesn't have the key. I gave the pouch to our Naval aide, Lt. Schulz. He took it in to the president. And the president has a key, I suppose? Of course he has. And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything? He said, ''Thank you. '' Darling, step on it, will you? Admiral Stark can't be reached. Should l take it to chief of staff? It's after 10, General Marshall always retires early. I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete. -Wait till you have the final part. -Yes, sir. If you're so concerned. . . . . .why don't we call chief of war plans, Admiral Turner? His telephone doesn't answer, sir. -You don't happen to know where he is? -No idea. The president has already discussed it with me. He sent a personal message to the emperor. But when the final part of this comes in, I¬íd like to see it then. -Good night, commander. -Good night, sir. I was starved. I¬íll bet you are. Oh, thank you, dear. Can't you tell me anything? Even a hint? You'd think the world was falling apart. Admiral Stark talked to the president. What did the president say? He sent a personal message to the emperor. Gordy. We got those B-1 7s coming in from California in the morning. Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night. . . . . .so the planes can home in. You and l had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp. Yes, sir. -Tyler, I¬íve got a job for you. -Sir. Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400. At 4:00 in the morning? From 4 to 7 a.m. Our marvel of science only operates for three hours. Lucky boy. Lucky boy! Captain, how's it feel? First command, first patrol. Just fine, Mr. Young. In fact, I think I'll turn in for a while. -Good night, sir. -Good night. Here you are. Kramer. Al, listen to this. The fourteenth part. ''Will the ambassadors please submit our reply. . . . . .to the United States government at precisely 1 p.m. . . . . .December 7th, your time. '' 1 p.m.? ''Precisely 1 p.m., your time. '' I¬íll be right over. Look at the president's message. I should have had it hours ago. As you know, communications have been delayed. . . . . .and frequently garbled lately. Or deliberately interfered with. Gene, call the foreign minister. Tell him l want an immediate audience with the emperor. ''After deciphering. . . . . .part 14. . . . . .destroy at once. . . . . .your cipher machine. . . . . .all codes. . . . . .and secret documents. '' Translate this immediately. -Give a copy to Kramer when he comes. -Yes, sir. I¬íve got to get the hell out of here. Hey, look at this. Finally got one. Communication center. It even works. That's great. Opana Point, communications check. Are you reading us? Coming in loud and clear. Where's the general? It¬ís Sunday, sir. This is Colonel Bratton. Connect me with Chief of Staff, General Marshall. Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer. Chief of staff's quarters, Sergeant Aguirre speaking. Yes, Colonel Bratton. I¬ím sorry, sir, the general isn't here. Where he always is this time Sunday morning. -Where's Colonel Bratton? -Gone to see General Marshall. He left this for you, sir. The 14th part of this intercept Kramer. . . . . .just delivered indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack. We know war is coming. We know they have an expeditionary force heading south. Sir, as hostilities seem imminent. . . . . .I recommend you telephone Admiral Kimmel. . . . . .in Hawaii. No. I better call the president first. Now, if you'll all please excuse me? -Yes, sir. -Thanks. ''The Japanese government regrets to have to notify. . . . . .the American government. . . . . .that, in view of the attitude of the American government. . . . . .it is impossible to reach. . . . . .an agreement through negotiations. '' -There are supplemental messages. -Thank you. Gentlemen, I am convinced the Japanese intend to attack. . . . . .at or shortly after 1:00 today. -I¬íll alert all Pacific commands. -Yes, sir. Colonel Bratton, just a minute. Take this to communications center. Come in. Captain, can you come to the bridge? Very well. Sub contact, Mr. Goepner? -We're not sure. -What ship? The Navy tug Antares. Look astern of her, captain. She's towing a target raft. Look between the ship and the raft, sir. That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine. She's sneaking through the net into the harbor. General Quarters. -Sound General Quarters. -All engines ahead, full. -Come left, 15 degrees. -Come left 15 degrees, sir. -Tell Antares we're attacking. -Aye, aye, sir. Flags, tell Antares we're attacking. -Mount one, commence firing. -Mount one, commence firing. -Stand by to roll depth charges. -Stand by to roll depth charges. -Roll one. -Roll one. -Roll two. -Roll two. Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone. Aye, aye, sir. Captain Earle speaking. -We have a message from the ward. -All right, read it to me. ''Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone. '' We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky. But this is the real thing, sir. Closer than any previous sighting. Just off the harbor entrance. You and I know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid. I¬íll pass it to Admiral Block. With all do respect, sir, I think we should alert all commanders. Confirmation, Kaminsky. I want confirmation. This is hot. General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route. Right. The general's handwriting: it's hard to read. You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe. Major, l picked up some great music from Honolulu. That's fine, pipe it through. Where's the damn chow truck? Shut the thing down, George. It¬ís already after 7. Hey, Joe, come here. What do you make of that? I¬íve been watching it for minutes. It¬ís moving in, fast. I¬íve never seen anything that big. -Looks like two main pulses. -Hey, Joe, I got it. I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east. Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far. We gotta contact the information center. Our problem is over at 7:00. The center might make some sense out of it. Okay, suit yourself. Information center. I don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here. Is that right? Hang on a minute. Lieutenant, sir. Lieutenant Tyler. Sir, this is Private Elliot, Opana Point. There's a large formation of planes coming in. . . . . . 140 miles, three degrees east. Well, don't worry about it. The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s. . . . . .coming in from the mainland. -He said not to worry about it. -Come on, let's go eat. General, l sent this to Manila, the canal zone and San Francisco. . . . . .but the direct channel to Hawaii is out. Atmospherics again? Yes, sir, it's real bad today. We could give it to the Navy. What makes you think their atmospherics are better? -Send it as a telegram. -Yes, sir. Do you mean a submarine was cited over half an hour ago. . . . . .and that it's taken this long to report it to me? I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed. I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report. A submarine that close is a serious matter. A very serious matter. Get the confirmation or reports to my office. I mean, right now. Have my driver get the car. Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir. . . . . .should l tell General Short you'll miss the golf date? No, damn it, get my car. A message for the general at Fort Shafter. -Is it marked urgent? -No. It¬ís a little bumpy, Davey. . . . . .but you have to fly in all kinds of weather. Sure, Miss Fort. Don't let the nose drop. That's better. You're doing just fine. I¬ím taking over, Davey. Stand by. Execute. Get his number. I¬íll report him for safety violations. Come on! Alert all commands: ''Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill. '' General Quarters. Man your stations. Man your stations. Sir. Battle stations. Battle stations. Fire your gun. Fire at will. That bastard! Station six, man your pump. Plane to starboard. Pearl Harbor is being attacked. -Pearl Harbor? -Pearl Harbor is being bombed. Pearl Harbor's being attacked. Go back to your quarters. Pearl Harbor's being attacked. What in the hell is going on? Why wasn't the Army notified? Did anyone think to inform Washington? I thought so. -General. -Put all units on a full war footing. Alert the territorial guard. Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater. -Yes, sir. -I¬íll be right down. Oh, my God. The island's under attack. Those bastards will kill us all. Men, get to the armory. Get guns, ammunition. -You too, lieutenant. -Yes, sir. -Operator. -Duarte airfield. All the phone lines are jammed. Well, try the radio again. Hose down that plane. Run for it. Run, run! There's Hickam. Major, l heard something funny on the Honolulu radio. What kind of traffic control is this? The radio said something about an attack. They're Japs, sir. What a way to fly into a war. Unarmed and out of gas. Oboe leader to Oboe flight. We've flown into the middle of a war. Get out fast. Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler. We've been hit. Nothing serious. They shot one circuit box. The landing light isn't working. Better use the hand crank. Hurry. -Major. -Yeah. One wheel is stuck. Well, jolt it loose. We're going in. -l tried. -Try again! Here they come. Fire! Tell them to stop shooting at us! We're Americans. Major, no go, sir. Like l said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war. -Run for it! -Hurry up! Tower to B-1 7, there's a Jap on your tail. Goose your engine and get out. Have damage control report all damages. Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry. Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down. All right, you guys, let's go. Where the hell are our fighters? Captain, the main fuel tanks are fractured. Lower deck's flooded, we're listing 8 degrees. Counter flood, counter flood. You wanted confirmation, captain? Take a look. There's your confirmation! ''Oklahoma, capsized. Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to the head. West Virginia, subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires. Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing. '' The California, two torpedoes, fires all around, temporarily abandoned. I¬íve just come from her. It¬ís spent, sir. Would've been merciful had it killed me. Mr. Secretary. ''Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill. '' No, this can't be true. They must mean the Philippines. No, sir. It¬ís Pearl. Get me the White House, the direct line. Yes, sir. Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment. Please be seated. Mr. President, has this been confirmed? Then, sir I¬íd like you to have it confirmed. . . . . .before I receive Nomura and Kurusu. They're waiting outside. Operator. Operator. Get me Haleiwa field. Fast. George, get a hold of a car, a truck, anything. I¬ím calling Haleiwa. I¬íll get them to start our planes. Go. Recommend course 2-3-0, sir. -Very well. Stay at 2-3-0. -Stay at 2-3-0, sir. Take cover! More hose! More hose! More water. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! -Abandon ship! Abandon Ship! -Over the side! Can't get through the outer channel in this shape. She goes down here, she'll block the south channel. We'll have to beach her there so she's clear. File these. G-5. I need five copies each. Messenger. -Take this to General Short's office. -Right. File these. Corporal. This has to be decoded for the general. Take it to the decoding room. Ask them to send it back soon. Run for it! Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes. What are you waiting for? -We got no water. -Why? What's wrong? It¬ís the Arizona. She cut the pipes in the mains. The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel. If it goes, we'll blow up the harbor. Hey, look out! In all my 50 years of public service. . . . . . I have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods. . . . . .and distortions. . . . . .on a scale so huge. . . . . .that I never imagined until today. . . . . .that any government on this planet. . . . . .was capable of uttering them. Mr. Hull. Go. Yes, all right. This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department. Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel. Pardon me, admiral. -From Washington. -Thank you. Gentlemen. ''The Japanese are presenting at 1 p.m. . . . . .Eastern Standard Time today. . . . . .what amounts to an ultimatum. Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know. . . . . .but be on alert accordingly. '' Signed. . . . . .George C. Marshall, chief of staff. My God. This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific. Ours and the Lexington. We don't want to get caught like they did. I don't intend to. When can you be ready for sea again? We can fuel and provision and be on the way before dawn. Good. That's good. Monday, august 2, 1907. It's six o'clock in the morning. Today, my youngest son is going to leave our home. 3 years of military Academy, and he enters His Majesty'a Army. I hoped his first assignment would have been in town or in a near village. Instead, he leaves for a loneIy fort on the most distant border of the empire. Come on, wake up. it's six. I'd like to be as happy as you it's not your fault. But I don't want to leave with this memory of you. I know what it all means to you. It's sad forthose who are left behind. Go now! You're lucky. You'll be hearing the famous trumpets of Fort Bastiano every day! I don't even know what the fort looks like, but it's very distant. You'll be the one who is going to live the most exciting adventure. Do you see that grove there? . when I'm gone beyond them, you won't see me anymore. Hey there. Hey! Sir! What is it? Nothing, Sir. nothing. I just wanted to salute you, that's all. Who are you? Lieutenant Drogo, Sir. Go on! Go on. Our paths will meet farther down. - Captain Hortiz. - Lieutenant Drogo. I suppose on the way to Bastiano? I'd given up hope of ever finding the fort. Why? I must have taken the wrong way, Sir, and. If you're coming from that direction, you certainly did. Those mountains are the border with the North Kingdom. No Army could cross them from either side. There's never been a fort of any kind around here. No need for it. Bastiano is farther on. to the north. A messenger? And you don't know the roads? Amazing! I'm not, Sir. I'm reporting there for duty. My first assignment. Congratulations, Lieutenant. You couldn't have made a better choice. - Two years, I suppose. - Sir? That's the rule. Two years on the border count double for seniority. I didn't know that, Sir. But I didn't choose Bastiano. - No? - I was ordered there. Odd! Usually. - Give me a drink, Strauss. - Sir. What's odd, Captain? There aren't many volunteers for Bastiano these days. That must explain your orders. - WouId you like a drink? - Yes, please. - Strauss! - Thank you, Captain. Bastiano is a dead border station. - . as you will see. - Thanks. Only a pebble, Sir. A splinter in the hoof. What did the Captain mean by a ''dead border station''? A border with nothing on the other side of it. AbsoluteIy nothing. Beyond the fort there is a desert, Lieutenant Drogo. And then. nothing. - The Desert of the Tartars. - The Tartars? They may even have crossed the desert once, a long time ago. But they vanished, after destroying the ancient city. The desert has kept their name. The older a nation's history is, the more legends spring up. In the end, we don't know what's true and what isn't. I've been at Bastiano for eighteen years. I admit the place looks much more beautiful inside than from out there. I see you are in a hurry to report. Ride ahead. Go. go ahead, Lieutenant. Halt! Advance and be recognized! Lieutenant Drogo. Assigned to Fort Bastiano. I've come to take up my post. Simeon. Drogo, Sir. Welcome to Bastiano. Thank you. Lazare! First Sergent Tronk. Take the Lieutenant's horse. Come, I'll take you to meet Major Matti. - Take over, Tronk. - But, that was a general aIarm! What of it? In case of alarm, the commissioned officer on duty takes command. That's regulation, Sir. Paragraph 3 of the regulations, Tronk. But paragraph 12 says: ''Guard posts not immediately exposed to attack, which is this case. may be placed underthe command of a high-ranking non-commissioned officer''. Any objections? None, Sir. Fine. Come with me, Lieutenant Drogo. It's not your fault, but you've arrived at the worst possible moment. I'm sorry, Sir. Colonel, this is Lieutenant Drogo. I'm delighted to welcome you to Bastiano. The King himself has called us ''the noblest guardian of His Crown''. Our garrison is an enviable assignment for an ambitious young officer. You'll soon see for yourself. I'm listening, Lieutenant. All positions ready to open fire on the enemy 6 minutes after the aIarm. Six minutes, you say? Five minutes and 42 seconds. A pity you're leaving us, Lieutenant. As a soldier. I'll miss you. If I may say so. I'll miss you too, Sir. as a soldier. You may go, Lieutenant. Good riddance! A fine efficer, but. aII the same, good riddance! WouId you Iike to be introduced to His ExceIIency right now, or at mess? This evening at mess, Sir. It wiII be an honor. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. My name's Rovine. I'm the doctor here. Your medicaI fiIe arrived here before you did. WeIcome to Bastiano. Thanks, Sir. Excuse me, CoIoneI. This is Lieutenant Drogo. - Sir. - No, thank you. Don't insist, I toId you. Make up your mind. I can easiIy wait anotherthree days. I'm steaIing him from you. Come, Drogo. What's wrong with the Lieutenant CoIoneI? A gIorious battIe wound. when there were stiII wars. Broken back. SteeI corset. He's the onIy one who's actuaIIy been under fire. I onIy suggested you'd be better off stationed in town. You've just come from the city heIp me convince him! - Keep out of this, Lieutenant. - Be carefuI, pIease. Getting invoIved in Rathenau's and AmerIing's bickering can be dangerous! Sirs! His ExceIIency! WeIcome back, Hortiz. I hope the traveI was fine. Thanks, Sir. Dear Nathanson, GeneraI Conrad greets you. He wouId Iike to have you for the Army manoeuvres in the south. WouId you. pIease. Go on. PIease, Sirs. Lieutenant Drogo, Sir. He has arrived this morning. The Adjudant has my papers. I request the honor of introducing myseIf to you. Jean Baptiste Drogo, Infantry Lieutenant, at your orders. Good evening, your ExceIIency. Good evening, gentIemen. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. His ExceIency, CoIoneI, Count of FiIimore commander in chief of the garrison, invites you to join us. CoIoneI Nathanson. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I am in command of your company. Captain Hortiz. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I am in command of the garrison cannon. Captain Von Sern. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I am the garrison physician. Major doctor Rovine. I am Simeon, senior subordinate officer of the garrison. Lieutenant Simeon. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I'm AmerIing. Lieutenant Von AmerIing. - Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant Von Rathenau. I'm Maude. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. Lieutenant Maude. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. My name's Von Arnim. Lieutenant Von Arnim. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. I'm Sarteris. Lieutenant Sarteris. - Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant Gothard. Second Lieutenant MoreI. - Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. Second Lieutenant MoreI. Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo. WiII you dine with us? Thank you, ExceIIency. Thanks, Sirs. I am honored. You can't reaIIy see the desert untiI you're at the advance post overthere. What can you see from there? Stones. sand. dust. And aImost aIways, mist. But further, to the north. You must be abIe to see something? Nothing but mist, winter and summer. StiII. there are some who insist that they've seen riders on white horses. PatroIs from the North Kingdom? Not necessariIy. Where eIse wouId they come from? From the desert. If it were true, the GeneraI Staff wouId know abouti it. peopIe wouId know. There are things they prefer not to taIk about, officiaIIy. CoIoneI FiIimore never mentions them. - As for Hortiz. - Captain Hortiz? It was shortIy after he got to Bastiano. He was in charge of the outpost. He saw them just at the edge of the mist. Hortiz saw the riders? He even gave the aIarm. He had a cannon shot fired. A serious decision. An officer Iike Hortiz wouId never have done it. . without being sure. When dawn came, the riders had disappeared. So he was the onIy one who saw them. This morning he toId me Bastiano was a dead border station overIooking nothing. He spoke of Iegends. But aII the same he's stayed on here, waiting. Waiting for what? The enemy. From the North Kingdom or from the desert. Hortiz may not beIieve so strongIy, now but he's waiting, Iike the others. CaIm down, CoIoneI. try to stay caIm for a moment. I'II heIp you, don't worry! How can I make you an injection? CaIm! Give me a hand! HoId him! Hurry! Keep him stiII! What is he saying? He wants you to put your hand ovre his mouth. Keep him stiII! You can Iet him go, Lieutenant. The drug acts aImost immediateIy. - Ijust can't beIieve it, you know. - What? That I'II be back in town. in two days and I won't see this fort anymore. but you. You'II be seeing my famiIy? There's stiII time. I'II wait for you. Why don't you? No. I toId you, I Iike Bastiano, and I feeI fine. Anyway, that's what you're to teII my mother. Promise me. What eIse can I teII her, the truth? That everyday, you are cIosest to the suicide, here at Bastiano? You mustn't be Iate. - Goodbye. - Bye. Very weII! You've been frank with me, and I'II be frank with you. Twice a year, we aII have a medicaI examination. Me. Lieutenant CoIoneI Nathanson. the CoIoneI himseIf. Everybody. It's reguIation. When yourturn comes, I promise to get you a negative report. You can count on me. Is that cIear, Lieutenant? Yes, Sir. I don't know how to thank you. The next examination wiII be in four months' time. Four months? That's the best I can do, Lieutenant. What if I wouId send in an appIication? There's your careerto think of. AppIying for a transfer at your first assignment couId harm you. According to my suggestion, you'II have time to show what you can do. Four months. that's not so bad! I beIieve you're right, Sir. I'm going to take your advice. Good! Keep it a secret! Just between you and me. Good morning, Sir. Lieutenant Drogo. Your pIatoon moved in ahead of Lieutenant Sartoris' at roII caII. He's your senior, here. Lieutenant Sarteris' pIatoon was Iate, Sir. Stay in your pIace! Your men are weII discipIined, Lieutenant, congratuIations. So I'm aII the more sorry you made the decision to Ieave us. Don't be surprised. Everybody knows about your agreement with Major Matti. You know, many young officers have come to Bastiano just Iike you. And those who have chosen to stay, don't feeI inferior. I neverthought anything Iike that, Sir. I wanted a different assignment. It was mere chance that I was sent here. And if the chance wants you to stay? Maybe that's what happened to me. It's more probabIe that chance had nothing to do with any of it. CIose ranks, Lazare! Get a move on! - Come on, you stupid muIe! - Lazare! Move on! - March! - Come on, move! Coming off Guard. Be carefuI! Present arms! PIatoon, haIt! Ground arms! Coming off guard, ground arms! Stand at ease! - Is this your first duty out here? - Yes. Rather boring, but you get used to it. You'II see. Night faIIs earIy, this time of year. Sooner or Iater, in this darkness, something's going to happen. The CoIoneI shouId be warned of the danger. What danger? You see Lieutenant AmerIing's unit? It'II be dark when they get back to the fort. Lieutenant AmerIing, Iike you, Sir, has three different passwords. The one who was vaIid when he Ieft, the one he used here and the one he wiII need to reenterthe fort. Because, meanwhiIe, the guards wouId have come off duty. - What of it? - WeII. Suppose that the onIy officer who knows the password faIIs sick. In that case, the guard coming off duty wouIdn't be Iet into the fort. Beacuse onIy that officer must give the password. - The sentries wouId recognize them. - In the dark? And what if the returning guard was attacked by surprise and wiped out by an enemy patroI between here and the fort? The enemy soIdiers couId put on our uniforms. True. Without the password, Sir, nobody coming from the North VaIIey, . and I mean nobody, can enterthe front. Tronk! - Tronk! - At your orders, Sir. Tronk. I may be mistaken. But it seems to me. out there. - Look! Look! - What is it? Something out there, straight! Everybody back to your posts! CIam down the horses! It's coming this way! No, it's moving, not toward us. Back to your posts, not a sound! - DoubIe the guard, CorporaI. - Yes, Sir. - You! Up to the pIatform! - Yes, Sir! - Ready at the cannons! - Yes, Sir. - Everybody on position! - It vanished, now. - I can't see nothing, now. - Machinegun ready to fire! They can teII. What do you mean? The horses, they can feeI them coming. Them who? Shut up! From where? And who. There's onIy desert. miIes of desert. Tronk. WouId you give the aIarm? Fire the cannon is an heavy decision. In a coupIe of minutes, the fort wiII be on war. I'd wait tiII dawn, Sir. What do you think of that, Tronk? Nothing yet, Sir. Ask the corporaI to come here. Then get back to your cannon. Yes, Sir. AII right. Now teII me what you think. That horse isn't from Bastiano, Sir. Maybe you haven't noticed. At Bastiano aII the horses are bIack or bay. Where wouId it come from? ReIieve the night guard, CorporaI. Put three gunners at the cannon, ready to fire. Tronk. WouId you advise me to give the aIarm, now? No Sir, not yet. But we shouId be prepared to, any moment. That horse. What is the danger of a Ione horse? Might mean danger is on the way. From the North Kingdom? Their horsemen have never ventured into the desert. At Ieast, not untiI now. Then speak out, Tronk! I want to hear you say the word! Tartars, Sir. It's a Tartar horse. Nothing's going to happen. No one's coming. We spent our whoIe day staring at that horse. Lazare, on your post! I know how you feeI, Sir. But the border is just beIow us. - ReguIations are reguIations. - What of it? Bet that horse out there never heard of your reguIations! AII right, Tronk. I won't send anyone to bring the horse in since it's against reguIations. Our reIief wiII be here in an hour. And it wiII soon be dark. - Who goes there? - Guard returning from the out post. - Give the password! - Sword and banner. Open the door! Guards, haIt! Stay at ease. - CaII the roII Tronk, and dismiss. - Yes, Sir. - CorporaI, caII the roII. - Yes, Sir. - Merru. - Present. - Sveta. - Present. - Vinovich. - Present. - FiIey. - Present. - Fritz. - Present. - Haus. - Present. Lazare. - Lazare! - Present. That horse shouId have been captured. But, reguIations, Sir? An officer must take responsibiIity, sometimes. You may go now, Major. Stay, Lieutenant. You behaved wiseIy, Lieutenant. First, not by aIerting the fort. Am I right, ExceIIency? It was just a horse without an horseman. SecondIy, you foIIowed reguIations to the Ietter. I congratuIate you, Lieutenant. A border is a border. OnIy His ExceIIency couId have taken the initiative to capture the horse. Do you think that horse beIonged to a miIitary unit? - Answer me, Captain. - No, I don't think so. StiII, you admit the incident is suspect from an army standpoint. Yes, Sir. Then why haven't you doubIed the guard? Those are the times when the reguIations shouId be appIied strictIy. Come, Lieutenant. - A white horse, you say? - Yes, ExceIIency. CoIoneI, pIease. I'm honored, CoIoneI. - No speciaI marks? - No, Sir. Nothing. No saddIe. - It must have gone away by now. - No doubt, your ExceIIency. Do you think I shouId have trespass the borderto catch it? ReguIation is reguIation, Lieutenant. It's certainIy His ExceIIency's opinion. You may go now, Major! You must not bIame yourseIf Lieutenant. The Major is unfortunateIy right. We can do nothing about it. - Who goes there? - Private Lazare, muIe driver. Listen, friend. I've broken reguIations, try to keep it quiet. I've got a horse, here. Advance and give the password! The password? How shouId I know it? Didn't you hear about the horse? Look, I'm bringing it in. Are you going to open up or not? - The password! - I toId you. I don't know it! My name's Lazare. You must recognize me. I can't make out your face. What are you doing? You're not going to shoot! No! Don't shoot! No! - AIert! - AIert! - AIert! - Everybody on his posts! - Open the door. - You can't get out, Sir. Get off! Lazare! Right in the middIe of the forehead. Who fired? Private Kupka, Sir. First rate shot. I trained him myseIf. - And what's this one's name? - Private Lazare, Sir. A diserter. As weekIy duty officer, it's my job to find out how the tragedy occurred. Tragedy? Stop being dramatic, Captain! Lazare tried to bring the horse back to the fort. The sentry can testify. He'II testify! He'II prove this soIdier was a traitor! You aIso have a few things to expIain, Lieutenant. This soIdier was one of your guard, wasn't he? Yes, Sir. His disobedience couId be the cause of a serious incident. The North Kingdom might protest for border vioIation! You can't be serious. DeaI with this, Tronk. Have him buried. Without honors! Yes, Sir. Sir! - Order. arms. - Yes, Sir. Order. arms! Order. arms! Order. arms! Order. arms! Order. arms! What's going on? Tronk, what's going on! The third pIatoon refuses to obey orders, Sir. It's private Lazare's section. Refused to present arms before the fIag. Refusing to obey. These men beIong to your company, Captain. And to your section, Lieutenant! I demand a report, immediateIy! Order. arms! You bastards. Let them stand there. Without food and water As Iong as they refuse to obey! At ease! My report, your ExceIIency. What do you want from them, Major? First, their submission. Then, I want them severeIy punished. The dead soIdier was one of them, wasn't he? That's no excuse, ExceIIency. Those men refused to present arms before their officers and the fIag! And they didn't obey, insuIting me. Order. arms! Present'arm! Excort these men to their ceIIs, Sergeant. Four days of bread and water. You have heart condition, this aItitude is bad for your system. WiII that do? Perfect. Thank you. Bastiano is probabIy bad for everyone. I'm not sure God himseIf couId survive here. You're thinking of AmerIing's iIIness? Yes. he's not the onIy one. Some nasty germs have been trapped in these waIIs for centuries. There's no cure. And it's impossibIe to diagnose. Even the speciaIists in the capitaI are at a Ioss. - You're wise to Ieave. - That's not the reason. I was sent here by mistake. Here, eIsewhere. we're aII somewhere by mistake. You're wise. If I couId, I myseIf. CouIdn't you ask for a transfer? I couId, of course. but I'd feeI Iike a deserter. With that certificate, you can Ieave whenever you Iike. AII you need is the GeneraI's signature. You're Iucky, he'II be here in two weeks. Quickerthan sending it to town and waiting for an answer. Thank you. - Goodbye, Lieutenant. - Goodbye. Touched! You're first rate, AmerIing, but I'm not as young as you are. You're not even out of breathe. You think I can't Iast to the end? I reaIIy wouId Iike to stop, but if you want to continue. Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Garrison! On your knees! Lord, I'm afraid, and I pIace my trust in Thee, Father. O Lord, grant us peace! Turn not Thy face away. BIess my souI and wash away my sins. Jesus, have mercy upon us. Saturday night, as the first day of the week was dawning. Mary MagdaIene and the other Maria, after bought some essences came to see Jesus' sepuIchre to embaIm him. And then an angeI came, it descended from up above. It knocked overthe stone, and sat on it. It seemed Iike a thunder, and with a dress so shining. The guards, frightened, faIIen on the ground as they were dead. The AngeI smiIed to the women and said: ''Don't be afraid, the man you are Iooking for, isn't here.'' He rose again from the death, on the third day, as he had foretoId and has gone to GaIiIea. Go, and meet him there. They have swords, and shieIds. Who, Sir? The horsemen in the desert. The men I saw once, a Iong time ago. They ride white horses. They don't want anyone to see their swords gIeaming in the sun. They Iet them tarnish. An oId warriors' trick. Is that what you wanted to know? Why I stayed here? To wait forthem. - Captain Hortiz. - Good evening, Captain. Your ExceIIency. Our dear Nathanson. - I'm happy to see you, how is it? - Good, ExceIIency, better. - Lieutenants Von AmerIing. - Sir. - . Von Arnim. - ExceIIency. - . Maude. - Sir. Lieutenant Gothard, - Honored. GIad to see you, ExceIIency. - Lieutenant Sarteris. - Your ExceIIency. Your mother is my wife' s friend. They meet often. She aIways asks me about you, I'II teII herthat we have met. Thank you very much, Sir. - Lieutenant MoreI. - Good evening. Good evening, Lieutenant. - Major Mattis. - Nice to see you. Honored. - Captain Von Sern. - Captain. - Lieutenant Simeon. - Ah, Simeon. I know your father, we were together in the academy. ExceIIency, I know. - This is Lieutenant Drogo. - Lieutenant you're new at Bastiano, aren't you. I've been here four months, Sir. Lieutenant Drogo is one of the garrison's best officer. I'm not surprised, Bastiano attracts aII of our best young men. - I'm happy to see you here. - Dinner is served. This way, ExceIIency. Let's have dinner! The ceremony has given me appetite. I envy you: the finest parades, the finest officers the finest cook. What's Bastiano's weak spot? - Is something going wrong? - No doctor, nothing. ShaII I have the GeneraI sign your certificate for you? No, Sir. Thank you. WeII, then come and sit. Don't just stand there. There he is! In there! - Missed him that time. - You missed it, not me. Don't provoke me with this kind of games. Neither with others. You wouId Iose in any case. Yes, untiI it's a game. Look! Overthere. - How many did you say? - One company, I shouId say. That soIdier. who brought the horse back to Bastiano you remember, Drogo? Yes Sir, I remember. It's too bad we never found where that horse was from. Come in, pIease. Your ExceIIency. The enemy wiII be in sight of Bastiano in a few minutes. - Did you say ''the enemy'', Major? - Yes, your ExceIIency. They are advancing armed, according to the ruIes of war. They hope to take us by surprise, after skirting the desert. Thank you, Major. Your ExceIIency, aren't you going to order a generaI aIarm? As aIways, I appreciate your sense of duty, Major. Inform the officers to report to me here, as usuaI, in 10 minutes. - But, Your ExceIIency. - You may go now, Major. Stay Lieutenant, pIease. Stay, pIease. What's the meaning of aII this confusion? Go back to your pIaces! You've no business here! CIearthe parapet! Move! CoIoneI, here are the officiaIs. Sit down, pIease, CoIoneI Nathanson. Sit down, gentIemen. Did you want to say something, Major? There are more on the way, Your ExceIIency, more aII the time. They're spreading out aIong the border. You can see them from the window. I don't think so. Stay where you are, Major. I'II ask you to Iook out, if I feeI it necessary. I'm sorry to have to say this: I have noticed more than once that, during the changing of the guard, some units arrive without their commanding officers. Your ExceIIency, we're wasting vaIuabIe time! Lieutenant MaIevic, ExceIIency. I bring a message from the Chief of the GeneraI Staff. Excuse me, gentIemen. Thank you, Lieutenant. You must be exhausted. Lieutenant Von Arnim wiII Iook after you. GentIemen. This morning, our soIdiers and you too were troubIed by the presence of foreign troops in the North VaIIey. The troops are from the North Kingdom, sent here simpIy to survey the border Iine, as we did ourseIves a few years ago. Good. The units in question wiII not come to Bastiano. They won't. They'II break up in smaII groups, to carry on the mission in the mountains. That is the message sent from the Chief of the GeneraI Staff. He aIso asks me to organize an expedition without deIay to estabIish the border Iine on our side in one mountain area where it hasn't yet been surveyed. I need hardIy add that it wouId be best we reached first. to take possession without incident. ExceIIency, I'm the onIy Engineer co-officer, here. WiII you authorize me to command the expedition? Yes, of course. Pick the men you need and Ieave at dawn. Have them take warm cIothing. You can Ieave. You're going to have a hard time waIking in those things. I don't want any deIays. And they're going to hurt. - Sergeant! - Yes, Sir. - We'II camp here. - PIatoon, haIt! Have the first unit set up theirtents here? The men who wiII go on top can rest. Yes, Sir. Sergeant, set up the tents, and discharge the muIes. Hey, you Iight the fire, and distribute the meaIs. I see you're in exceIIent form. Thank you, Sir. A pity we don't come up here more often. Magnificent view! In that case, you can come with me on the cIimb. That's what you want, isn't it? I wasn't expecting such an honor. Don't ever Ioose the contact with the person that's towards you. If you get Iost, fire 3 shots. We'II stop and fire. So you can reach us. Don't put off your gIoves! You, cover up your head! PIatoon! Twenty soIdiers, two non commissioned officer. - WeII, Lieutenant. - Goodbye, Captain. Goodbye, Drogo. Goodbye. - With God's heIp. Iet's go. - PIatoon, ready! Go, ahead! I wish I couId go with you, Drogo. To AmerIing's famiIy, teII his mother. You'II know what to say, I'm sure. WiII you be coming back, Drogo? I don't know, Sir. I'II go see the GeneraI. See you. You're asking me to Ieave Bastiano? This is impossibIe! I'm not asking you, Major. I have made my decision. It's not reguIation. onIy the GeneraI. The GeneraI promised me that he'd give you a spIendid assignment, . where your remarkabIe abiIity to command, wiII be appreciated. Your sudden interest in me is surprising, Your ExceIIency. No surprise! I've aIways appreciated your devotion to duty. But I don't beIong to your worId! That's the probIem, isn't it? You've never considered me the equaI of officers of your cIass. You put up with me. Let me handIe the jobs you didn't want to touch yourseIf. But you never had anything but contempt for me! Now, because of AmerIing, you insist on my Ieaving. You hoId me responsibIe for his death! You're the one who feeIs Iike that, and you're aImost pIeased. You're quite mistaken! You had nothing to do with the death of AmerIing. AbsoIuteIy nothing! It's something you can't understand. Beyond anything you are or ever can be! Here is your promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-CoIoneI. My congratuIations. Lieutenant, the GeneraI's right arm? Lieutenant, the GeneraI. . Bastiano! Yes. PIease, come in. Ah. You at Bastiano gave us pIenty of troubIes overthe border matter. His Highness accept no compromise where a piece of empire is envoIved. A mountain peak is a mountain peak. What's his name? Von AmerIing, Sir. Count Peter Von AmerIing. Hard headed deviI! His stubborness Iost us a mountain peak. Sir, AmerIing is the one who died. Ah, is that so? PIease, stay down. In any case, the whoIe business made a bad impression. Enough of that! You want a new assignment, do you? Bring me the fiIe of. What's your name? - Drogo. - Drogo! And preferabIy in town, I suppose. - Yes, Sir, if it can be arranged. - WeII! Let's see. Do you know Bastiano's weak point, Lieutenant? No, Sir, I've no idea. There are too many men. That's the weak point. Yes! It's a overstaffed. That's why it was decided to reduce its strenght. - Reduce the strenght? - You didn't know? No, Sir. I can't seem to find your transfer appIication. I didn't make an officiaI request. But I think this paper wiII do. It's a medicaI certificate, Sir. MedicaI certificate. I see, I see. And I aIso see it was made out a Iong time ago! Not that I doubt its vaIidity, but it's not recent enough. And anotherthing. If your heaIth was so poor at the time the certificate was signed, then why didn't you Ieave the fort? But, I was assured that. The best wouId be you return to Bastiano, Lieutenant to settIe this probIem. That is, if you are stiII in poor heaIth. WouIdn't be easier for me to make a normaI appIication fortransfer? No, Lieutenant. That was possibIe before, but not now. We're reducing staff at Bastiano, . we give preference to officers who have made reguIar appIications. But when, Sir? I never heard it mentioned. How shouId I know? You wouIdn't be asking me to show favoritism? No, Sir, certainIy not. Goodbye. Keep me informed. I may seem severe, but I Iike receiving young officers Iike you. At your age, an occasionaI taIking to doesn't do any harm. Goodbye, Lieutenant. - HeIIo, Lieutenant. - Are you Ieaving, Tronk? No, Sir. I'm staying. Sir. Drogo! You came back? My private IittIe museum. As time goes by, we accumuIate things without reaIizing, untiI the day. Come. The GeneraI toId me they were reducing the strenght of Bastiano. I didn't reaIize to what extent. orthat you'd be Ieaving too, Sir. Neither did I. It took everyone by surprise. UsuaIIy things proceed more sIowIy. Do you know why the GeneraI Staff has caIIed you back, Sir? No, they probabIy think I've been here Iong enough that I'm too oId. It's up to you to take my pIace, my young friend! WiII you do me the honor of having a Iast drink together? Of course, Sir. DeIighted. I was afraid I wouIdn't have the pIeasure of seeing you again, Drogo. - Here it is. - Thank you. But you wanted to go too, didn't you? There's been a mix up with my fiIe. - Is my command responsibIe? - I'm the onIy one to bIame. WouId you Iike me to put in a word, to speed things up for you? Thank you, Sir, but I don't mind staying a whiIe Ionger at Bastiano. - Hortiz wiII be happy to have you. - Captain Hortiz is staying? Major Hortiz. He's repIacing me as commander at Bastiano. It was my wish. If you'II excuse me, I stiII have a great deaI to do. I won't be coming to mess again. Take care of yourseIf. - Sir. - Goodbye. Have you come back? What is it? - You don't seem pIeased to see me. - Ijust thought you'd never come back. - Any news? - Nothing, as usuaI. - May I have it back? I must go. -Just one moment. - What are you Iooking at? - Nothing particuIarIy. - They're waiting for me..Simeon! - There's a Iight, down there! What are you taIking about? Have you gone crazy? There isn't just one Iight, there are four or five! That's absurd! Look! I teII you! A bit more to the right! Can you see it now? Don't teII me you don't see anything! I wouIdn't beIieve you! I discovered them 3 weeks ago. I didn't wanted to teII you, yet! Why not? You might have Iaughed at the idea. That's why nobody must be toId! The Iights are there, everybody can see them. No, not without a speciaI fieIdgIass Iike this. AII the more reason to teII Hortiz, at Ieast! No. They wouId canceI the departures. Some of them wouId take advantage of the opportunity. What opportunity? If something finaIIy does happen, the fewer of us, the better! What do you mean? It's probabIy a nomads' camp. No. They wouId move. In three weeks' time they wouId have vanished. It's a construction site. Thery're buiIding a road. A road? In the desert? What wouId be the use of it? To reach Bastiano faster. To bring up heavy weapons. Cannons across the desert? Simeon. - Do you reaIIy beIieve that? - Think what you Iike! . But don't teII a souI! Understand? I beIieve it's best not to. Leave me yourteIescope, wiII you? Sir. Do us the honor of presiding at ourtabIe. This way, gentIemen. Thank you. I beg you pardon for being Iate. What are you Iooking at, Lieutenant? And what are you and Simeon pIotting together aII the time? A secret that has became too heavy for us. We were pIanning to teII you, of course, . but we wanted to be certain. Certain of what? Look for yourseIf, Sir. That way. There, straight that way. What was I supposed to see, Lieutenant? Sir, those IittIe Iights. Way out there in the desert. I don't know what you're taIking about. I didn't see a thing. I assure you. not a thing. AbsoIuteIy. Listen. I don't want that a voice, based on an opticaI iIIusion couId take pIace. In the past, irresponsibiIity Iike that, had damaged the fort. But Sir. This time. Is that cIear, Lieutenant? Yes, Sir. I have just received your promotion to Captain. CongratuIations, Drogo. - Anything eIse, Sir? - No, you may go. They're advancing, but are they stiII invisibIe to the naked eyes? I can't understand it. Maybe they've run into troubIes. No, they don't want to aIarm us by coming too fast. They're pretending the road is of no great importance. Of course! That must be it! They hope we'II get used to it, and in time, the road wiII seem normaI. The proof: Hortiz's attitude. He never mentions it. - Who's on guard at the outpost? - Sarteris, but he can't see anything. I don't trust Sarteris, I don't trust anybody. - They're coming straight toward? - AbsoIuteIy. I've got two Iandmarks to guide me. I can't be wrong. Stay down. Come on, stay down. Ok? I'II go. But it couId take years. Years? Yes. Haven't you noticed how Hortiz has aged? CoIoneI Hortiz, commanding officer of the fort, request that aII officers and soIdiers ignore the said threatened invasion of our borders. Therefore, any man on duty at the outpost, must use onIy reguIation opticaI fieIdgIasses. Go on, Captain. . Anyone possessing opticaI instruments which do not conform, must surrender such instruments immediateIy. Then, an officiaI wiII keep them in a safe pIace. Missed! I can't understand why Hortiz gave that order. What does it matter, now? Nobody reaIIy beIieves in the road's existence. Even I. What did you mean, ''even I''? Strike! You didn't turn in yourteIescope? What eIse was I supposed to do? It was an order! Without that, we won't see anymore! You just won't see as far. Come in. - Have you sent for me, Sir? - Yes. WouId you have tea with me? Of course, Sir. with pIeasure. I have made the decision to abandon the outpost. May I ask why, Sir? I haven't enough men to keep a guard out there aII the time. But, it's the onIy pIace from which we can have advance warning. That wiII do, Drogo. I've had enough. Nothing you can say wiII make any difference. I have aIready signed the order. Excuse me, Sir. Things have been happening. things I can't understand. You can't have transmitted an order Iike this. An inspection guard wiII be sent there every ten days. I pIace you in command of it. Company! Present'arm! For CoIoneI Hortiz. - Hip, hip, hip. - Hurrah! Do I have your permission to enterthe mess haII? PIease, Sir. WouId you Iike anything? May I serve you? Just a coffee. Where have you been assigned, Sir? I'm going nowhere, Drogo. Things wiII be different here now. Perhaps I'd be wise to Ieave. Why? You're second in command now, in some years, you'II take Simeon's pIace. And stiII nothing wiII happen! - Do you reaIIy have to Ieave? - I received orders, Drogo. And obeying is the one thing I've aIways known how to do weII. I hope you'II command Bastiano, the day the enemy attacks, and he wiII, . even if I was ordered to ignore it. What absurdity, and what despise. I might have been usefuI in wartimes. So many years. such a Iong wait without knowing why. I'm gIad you kept me company this far. Now you must go back. Have we ever shaken hands? Never, Sir. Go away! Go! Drink this, Sir. It's coId up on this pIatform, at night. Come on, take it. I'II have your horse saddIed, Sir. we're going back. - Are you certain? - AbsoIuteIy, Sir. Sergeant Tronk saw them too. The cannon. My God, the cannon. This time. here we are. what do I have to do? I can't. He had a cannon shot fired. Tronk ordered them to fire the cannon. The Tartars! They're coming! Did you hearthat, Sir? The enemy's marching on Bastiano. - He's improved since tonight. - Oh, yes. - I feeI abIe to get up. - I wouIdn't advise that. You heard, the enemy is advancing. Yes, battaIions and battaIions! And you want to keep me in bed? It's not a decision by myseIf. What? WouId you try to fight? You ought to rest a day or two Ionger. Major Simeon wants you to stay in your room. Simeon? He came to see you Iast night, he didn't think you Iooked weII. Let him mind his business! Have they sent a messengerto town? Sergeant Lobis Ieft afterthe first cannon shot, Sir. By now, the GeneraI Staff has been informed. Damn it! WiII you Iet me know what's happening? I'm second in command at Bastiano! - CaIm down. - Sir. Stay caIm, come on! Don' t be agitated, come on. ReIax. Go to heII, Rovine. Leave me, Ieave me. Sir, the cannons are in sight. Rovine! I'm sorry. It's not your fauIt if I feII iII at this moment. It probabIy is, Drogo. Without any doubts. You'II make it, I know. - CaII here Kreysky. - He's on guard duty, Sir. Everyone's been mobiIized. - Except me! They think I'm too oId. You heIp me then!. I Iooked aII over for you, Drogo. I didn't know what to do. Decisions have to be made, and. Of course, I intended to teII you. How are you now? I'm fit for duty. GIad to hear it. I asked to send two regiments, immediateIy. What if the enemy attacks before they arrive? I've concentrated artiIIery here, to hit them from the side. You didn't take too many off the fort, I hope? OnIy ten cannons. I trust you agree. We'II open fire onIy if they reaIIy attack, not before. Why not? They may simpIy be. provoking us. Are you joking? No one sends out a whoIe army for provocation. Is it reaIIy an arm? Yes. Look for yourseIf. Take this. Are they easy to see? Yes. The head of the troops is in fuII sight. Sir?. Drogo, what's wrong? Don't worry, Simeon. I won't cause you any more troubIes. I'II be abIe to heIp you tomorrow. Where are they now? They haven't moved. They must be waiting for reinforcements. The best strategy wouId be to keep them away from estabIishing a firm position. Of course. . Open fire immediateIy. Don't you agree? Maybe. But I can't act aII by myseIf. If there's anything I can do, just teII me. I'm better aIready. I can' t stand this hoIe of a room any Ionger. Don't think I've forgotten you. I even have some good news, for you. Today, a very comfortabIe carriage wiII be there. What for? War or not war, friends come first. I won't Ieave you here in this room, when you'II get better care in town. You might have asked me. You were sIeeping. - Rovine toId you to do it? - No, it was my own idea. The enemy is at the gates of Bastiano and goes right on scIaping of waIIs. But, he does think you need a change of air. He toId me so. That's aII. I have no intentions of Ieaving, Simeon. I thought I was doing the best for you. It's been so many years I've waited so many years forthis day. I sacrificed everything on it. Everything. And now. Now that the enemy now that war. Do you want me to Ieave? You can't ask that of me. - It's impossibIe! Not you! - Stop it, Drogo! Yes, you're right. It's beside tho point. Anyway I'm not abIe to make such a trip. You were taIking about getting up, making yourseIf usefuI. It's not the same thing. Do you reaIIy want to be usefuI? When the reinforcements come, I coIuId biIIet 3 officers in this room. Two beds aIong this waII, and the third, in that corner. I'm sorry to say so But that's how you can be usefuI to Bastiano. This wiII be your way to heIp in war. By Ieaving my post? What eIse can you do in your condition? I understand but don't insist. I won't Ieave. AII right if you're going to take it that way! I spoke to you as a friend. Now your commanding officer is speaking. I know your sense of discipIine and I know you wiII obey. You won't be traveIIing under difficuIt conditions, you know. A Iot of us wouId Iike to be in your pIace. Don't worry I'II say in my report that you heId out to the end of your strenght and that your courage was an exampIe to us aII. Life everybody has got to accept the roIe which was destined to him. Goodbye. When you want, Captain, I'm ready. Just one more minute, soIdier. Drogo! Speak up, boy, 'fore I lay into you. There's three of 'em. Two is men. Any inside? Just an old white woman. You sure, now? But she got a shotgun. Well, you boys try not to piss yourselves. Watch it! Watch it! Okay, let's go! Get up! Come on! Come on. Come on. That's money is what that is. That nigger's worth $600, and you ain't. You owe that boy an apology. I'm sorry, Burrell, for. Don't tell me. I apologize. This lost property is to be protected until returned. I got three rolled. Pay me first. Last time you ain't pay me. Make sure your uncle shares that. You ain't thank me. Thank you, Marcus. Ain't no need to be countin', boy. Don't I provide when no one else did? You welcome to set out on your own. Go on now. Feed them niggers. It's your turn. Y'all thirsty? I got something for you. Name of the man you're looking for is Nate. He's diggin' graves for the Federals near Petersburg. About three, four nights from here by foot. I don't reckon I'd be welcome anyplace near. And this nigger just gonna happily walk hisself back south? Well, they buried his brother not two months ago down in Leesville. News ain't made it up there. You'll think of somethin'. How 'bout you give me 50 for the boy? In case I don't make it back. Even if I do, he'd be yours. He can cook, tend horses. Should keep the boy. Might need him. Besides, you do this right, you're gonna need help carryin' all that gold. There's a lot of country between here and there. And to the north and south of either place. And out west. If a man don't want to be found, there's many places he can go. Where you can go. Don't matter. If you don't bring this nigger back exactly how I say, I'll find you and put you in the ground, along with the boy. and everybody else you ever knew. Wake up. Why we goin' so far for just one runaway? Can leave you here if you don't like it. Makes no difference. - Why can't we just. - Money's why. And this one's worth more than them other three put together. I'll take that. - Who you think used to live here? - Now just keep quiet and listen. When we get back with him, we stay the last night. When we get back with him, we stay the last night here. When you get up, you go get Burrell 'fore that nigger wakes. They not a mile that way. And I don't want no talkin' about how you been here before or none of that shit. Understand? Good. Go on. Get down on the ground. Lay down there. What? Boy, get down on the ground like you sleepin'. Now get up and get out that door. So I can't hear ya. Again. You ain't asleep. So you hear everything. Goddamn it, boy. Again. If he's got a knife or something, we gotta take it from him while he's sleepin'. This ain't like sneakin' out the other night when they was scared and they ain't had nowhere else to go. This one's somethin' else. Go on, now. Your name Nate, sir? I'm Will from. That's my Uncle Marcus. From around Leesville. We come on account of your brother, Samuel? He got consumption. He ain't well. Say he ain't gonna last long. Can't go back down there. Your brother said. he wants to see you before he goes. - He ask us to tell you that. - How'd you find me? Your brother heard you was here. I don't know how. When was this? Three days back. And you just took it upon yourself to deliver the word? His master, Pritchards, tasked us with it, and we'll be paid. Say he ain't got long. He just wants to see you. Should we tell your brother somethin'? 'Bout why you ain't come back for him? Y'all from Leesville? He in a bad way? I'll see to it when I can. We should all head back together. Can we journey back with you? - The two of you make it up here on your own? - Yes, sir. Then. I figure you can make it back down on your own too. Well, we won't be a bother. Besides, we came all this way for you. We'll leave before sunup. And we stay off the roads. I can't be liable for foolish children. Now, go on. You want my advice, we'll make it there in three days if we head up. Don't want your advice. Well, you need it, ornery bastard. You headed that way? Yeah. You welcome to take any path you want. Marcus know the best way. You ain't got nothin' to worry about. You ever seen a cannon shoot off? I've heard 'em lots. Just never seen 'em. - Why do you think. - Didn't your mama ever teach you to shut up and listen sometime? I never knew my mama. So how long has it been since you run up north? I ain't a runaway. That's too much for you to be carryin', boy. My father gave me that. I don't give a damn who gave it to you. I ain't spending it till I see him next. Yeah, keep on rubbin' that thing. Shine it up. You rub that thing half as good as you was rubbin' your johnson last night, it'll shine right up. - Might even blind a man. - He lyin'. Hell, he could rub the eagle right off the back of that coin till it's smooth. - Least he's good at one thing. - I was a professional at his age. They's stuck on your back. Why they stick like that? Don't serve no purpose. It's a seed. That way they travel further than they could on their own. - But why do they. - You wearin' me out, boy. Well, I just. Hear that? - No. What's it sound like? - Keep listenin'. Very quiet. Was that it? Why we takin' him back to Burrell if he ain't a runaway? What? He owe Burrell money. And they might have to rough him up to get it, so stop getting all friendly with him. Maybe he'll just pay up so they won't have to. He made his choices. And don't forget what we stand to collect. Tonight, you try and sneak out in the night. See how good he sleeps. Boy, you best get up and get some more. We over here crackin' teeth, and this nigger eatin' pork? You know, a man can share. You're right. What's it like diggin' for the Federals? It don't seem no different from diggin' for a master down south. You seen me ask any man's permission to leave? You work hard, you're your own man. I don't need no one and don't look out for no one. Marcus and I look out for each other. ever since the army burned down the master's farm. Doin' what it takes to get by. We's family, you know? I knew my ma for about two hours, and my father was a sumbitch. Father went north two years back, but he's comin' back for me. Boy, that's bullshit and you know it. Comin' back down south for you is the last thing on the man's mind. Keep quiet and let a nigger sleep. Where you goin'? I got to piss. Then go right there. You ain't got to spend 10 minutes standin' up and then walk a mile out in the woods. Well? Well, I can't with you watchin'. Oh, shit, boy. Hold on now. Where you goin'? - Just hold up now. - You stole some of my salt pork. - I'll make my own way from here on. - Man, I ain't eat your food. I knowed you was a thief. You don't know a goddamn thing. What, you think I stole that shit? Why? You smell it on my breath? You smell it on my breath? Come on, nigger. Teach me a lesson. Just wait up now. Come on, boy. Grab the shit. Let's go. Take water if you need. The rest belongs to their kinfolk. Damn, if you ain't an uppity nigger. Slave for the Union is still just a slave. - He ain't like other men I seen. - Yeah. He's worth more. And don't you forget. What if it was you? Well, it ain't. Look at me, boy. Look at me. You wanna go back to sellin' tobacco for pennies? Now, you can live hand to mouth for the rest of your life. Or. you can make some money. Maybe even enough to find your daddy. Get down, boy. When I was your age, I was climbin' like that and broke a leg. How's it now? It's fine now. Well, if it ain't a problem, I'll keep climbin'. I always make you mad, don't I? Can you throw that? Show me how. Go on. Climb that tree. Got any other family? Besides your brother? Nothin'? I had a woman. not too far from here. Wasn't no words spoken over us, but she was my woman. No children? We had a child. Probably be a little older than you, but he ain't make it. You don't see her no more? Best this way. Got nothin' weighin' me down. - So what was her name? - Rachel. There's a lot of Rachels out there. Lord, I known a lot of Rachels in my day. Where you say your Rachel's from? We rested long enough. I'll fill this up, then we'll keep on. I'll fill it for you. This'll do for tonight. Come on. Let's get some wood. No fire tonight. We're too far from Union lines and don't need the attention. Well, I'm makin' a fire. So if you don't like it, you can freeze your ass on down the way. Get up. Let him be. The boy's feet ain't good. Come on now, boy. You gonna have to be your own man someday. Maybe we can do something nice for him. 'fore we turn him in. You think you good, but you ain't. You'd do the same thing if you was me. Can't we just. ask him for the money he owe Burrell? Goddamn it, boy. Burrell don't want money from him. Nate done killed a man, and Burrell's gonna kill him to get the bounty. Now, I'd do it for the money myself, but Burrell will kill me and you both. if we don't deliver him exactly how he say. Stop talkin' to that old man 'fore he figure us out and we got to kill him and drag his dead ass all the way back. This ain't just about the money. It's about your life. Nate's a dead man and can't nobody help him. What is it, boy? You ain't sleepin'? I can't always sleep neither. All of a sudden you quiet? Where's Nate? Get the boy! All right. All right. - Get down. - All right. All right, come on. All right, now, let's have a look. Come on. We'll get you right. This just so we ain't slowed down. You do everything I say or I'll leave you. Understand? Come on. You're all right. We only got two or three more nights. There used to be some freedmen livin' out here. We appreciate you havin' us on such a night. Your son look hungrier than you are. Me and your uncle didn't always get on well, but it was kind of him to come tell me the word about my brother. He died doin' a good thing. When the soldiers came, he tried to save himself. Why'd you come back for me? What's your name? Will. William. William sounds old. They call me Abby, instead of Abigail. Who's that man you with? He kin to you? Just a man. Just a man? That's cold, boy! You stayin' here? You should stay here. How come? Where you goin'? There ain't much other children round here. I ain't children. Ready? We gettin' closer now. I can't be seen in these parts. All right. When you throw it, hold your arm straight out. Let's see how you do. Come on. Come on. You used a hammer? Hold it like that. Lower. What's wrong with you, boy? Come on, now. Pick a tree, not too far. Boy, what's wrong with you? Come on. Pick a tree. Marcus didn't steal your salt pork. It was me. I'd have give it to you had you asked me. Nate. I. I got to tell you. If they see us, you just run. Don't look back. You got any other family round Leesville? When we get back, what you gonna do? I do odd jobs for a white man. I'm savin' up to go look for my pa if he ain't back soon. What kind of jobs? Different things up and down the Nottoway. I thought you said you was from Leesville. No. I am. It ain't too far from there. I saw you talkin' to that girl back there. - You ever had a girl of your own? - No. Don't. They trouble. - Not all of 'em. - Yeah. All of 'em. But they worth it. I'm bringin' him. - I done like Burrell said. - We ain't ridin' with Burrell no more. Son of a bitch killed Hayden two days ago. He ain't right. We found your boy. Where you two headed? I got a brother sick down in Leesville. We headed down that way. Ain't we? Y'all look to be in a sorry state. I ain't like to see men like that. niggers or not. Might as well make our way together. That's kind, but we'll be all right. We'll just keep alongside, if it suits you. I don't give a damn if it suits him. Stop! I warned him. We only got one more night after this. So I guess we'll just make do tomorrow. You saved me back there. I was savin' myself. You had a woman near here? Yeah. Y'all ain't never had another child together? It ain't always that simple. But them times was all right. You ever killed a man before yesterday? 'Bout six years back, my master died. His wife left for Boston and set me free when she did. So I headed up north to earn money to buy out my woman from her master. But a couple of pattyrollers tried to take me back. I showed 'em my papers. I killed one of 'em. Maybe I ain't have to, but I did. After hidin' out near five years, I lost touch with my woman. She ain't but five miles down that way. or was. Probably should've never left her. I miss her, but it can't be helped. I ain't never told no one 'bout that before. Why didn't you send word to her, tell her what happened? It ain't safe knowin' a man like me. I'd have wanted to know what happened. That night before my father went north, we fought over somethin'. what I can't even remember now. I wish I hadn't done that. I ain't sure he'd be too happy to see me these days. He'd be proud of you. I got something to say. If you gotta do something. you don't want to, that you know is wrong, but you ain't got no choice in it, are you goin' to hell? I don't know. You ain't got no choice, you ain't got no choice. Most times, we got a choice. Nate? Nate? Nate! You thought I left you? I wouldn't leave you. But I might if you don't bathe soon. Maybe we should stop by to see your woman. What? We gotta keep movin'. It ain't too far. Don't talk 'bout that no more. I don't know what the hell I'm doin'. Be quiet. I should just head on out of here. We done decided. She don't want to see me after all this time. And I don't care nohow. Yes, you do. Yeah? There a woman name of Rachel around here? Rachel live here. Sundays she go to town with the master's wife. Sometimes they spend the night. I think she'll be back this evening. You was her man? I's her man now. I don't think she'd be wantin' to see you nohow. I heard about you. What'd you hear? Just that you was set free. You went up north. You never come back like you said. She kept these. I ain't too fond of lookin' at 'em, if you want 'em. She kept them all this time? I don't know if I's supposed to give 'em to you. She kept 'em so long. A man's boots is a man's boots, but she might not like me givin' 'em to you. I never know what she thinkin'. Sometime her mood turn, she let me hear about it. She used to let me hear about it. Sometimes I think the whole county could hear about it once she got goin'. Hell, you probably know all about that too. Lord knows I sure do. She's somethin' else. Hell, you should probably stay and talk a while. You probably got all kinds of stories to tell. Well, I'll tell her you come by. Yeah. We can wait. She might be back this evening. No. We should push on. We could reach my brother by tomorrow afternoon. Rachel. Now? Now? Tell me. - Tell me. - All right. - I went up north like I said. - You was supposed to come back for me. Why didn't you come back? You could have told me something. So you responsible for that boy now? You ain't worth a damn. Comin' back here now. Come here, boy. Look at you. all filthy. Moth-eaten. I wouldn't expect no more from him, but somebody gotta take care of you. - We been traveling. - Don't. Don't talk at me. - I'm all right. - You all right? He ain't got nobody? If he ain't got nobody, just leave him here till they figure somethin'. I. I got people. You got people. Kin? Lord. You sure you ain't his son? 'Cause you just as much trouble. We should get on now. Don't make me no difference. What's wrong? We need to eat. There's stores at the crossroads. Some sell to Negroes. I can't be seen up there. This is just enough to get us hardtack and venison for tonight. I'll be here. Be careful. This too? This ain't enough. You got whiskey? What's all this? So you ain't too cold. You spent your pa's double eagle? I'll give this to my brother. It could be a comfort to him. Drink some now. We made it, didn't we? I don't know about seeing my brother after all this time. I don't know. Things ain't always happen the way they supposed to with him. Or with me. I ain't really lived like I should. I've wasted time. And it ain't always been my fault. But I'm gonna do what I need to, and things gonna be better. I'm gonna be better. What you think about that? You want to hold it? You can keep it till mornin'. You know, I got a little saved up. After I take care of my brother, we can go back north and look for your father. If you want. Hell, even if we don't find him, you can travel with me long as you want. We can go out west. Things supposed to be different out there. Maybe I could do for you what no one done for me. Ain't no point goin' it alone, really. What you think about that? Well? Well. you think about it. I was just thinking about you. Y'all get held up? Marcus ain't make it. Yeah, I heard. When we ride up, he best be waitin' for me. But I know he will. 'cause you're coming with us. He's here. I couldn't get his knife. Give me an hour. I'll get it. We should get movin' soon. Come on, now. Ain't no wind today. Should be warmer. Boy, what's wrong with you? Well? Speak up. Speak up. I want to get to my brother before dark. Your brother's dead. We was supposed to bring you for bounty hunters. They were gonna kill you for the money. They said they'd kill us if we didn't bring you. You got to go far from here. You ain't deserve none of this. They're comin'! They're here! We got to run or fight. We gotta go. Will? Come on out now. Let us do what we come for. Or else we can do you too. Nothin' gonna happen to you. - You gonna be all right. - Other side! Go round back. Go on now! Give me your other knife. Will? This ain't your fault, son. You ain't like them. You risked your own skin by tellin' me. I'm proud of you. Leave that there so they see it. You go north now. Take Rachel to them people in the swamp till this war's over. Then you go find your pa. - I'll catch up with you. - Will! If I don't, you give half that to Rachel. No! No! No! Nate! You done good. You done good. You're free to go. Don't follow us if you want to live. This story almost remained untold. However, it deserves praise. What is the good of telling it? The water diviner's stick quivers above the ground. <i>So severe was the winter of our tale,</i> <i>frosts as passionate</i> <i>as the Christianity of that time.</i> <i>Better to huddle by the fire</i> <i>and remember old times.</i> <i>Foolishness is scattered aimlessly.</i> <i>Why listen to it?</i> <i>Is there sense in what was written?</i> <i>For nothing, for poetry's sake.</i> <i>and at the behest</i> <i>of a wandering echo</i> <i>and because the oldest things</i> <i>lie in the present.</i> Part 1 - Straba How two Kozlik brothers hunted on the imperial road, how the neighbour, whose life was saved by piety, turned this to good account. Ask him how far it is to Boleslav. One-armed-man! How far is it to Boleslav? How far is it? Can't you hear me? He's deaf, he can't understand. He won't take any money. He's stupid, doesn't know what money is. The idiot doesn't understand. What's happened? That one-armed man! - I said what's happened? - They stole the horses! He attacked him, Heinrich! Watch over the count! Wait! - Is he still alive? - It's that rogue! Stay there, don't go with your father. Christian, come back! Only caught one hare the whole day - a German one! See that mare? Quite something! They're counts from Saxony - that one speaks Czech. He's the old man's footman. If we don't get rid of them we can prepare for the chase! Put him in fetters! Tie him up! Stop, you beast! Mangy animal! Greetings, Mr Lazar! Greetings to you. The beast's leg is bad. I took a bit of harness here. You know my loutish behaviour. They wanted to know what was going on here. Surely not some misfortune? They have to see everything for themselves. I said we had to go on, but would they listen? Shut up! Pray! God. Almighty God be blessed for bringing hope at the close of unhappiness. You break souls like a potter and mould them again. For there is mercy in the depths of Your anger. You have permitted my sins but do not allow your servant Mikolas his mortal sins. Remember my daughter Marketa and deliver me from evil. Without me, she will fall to the impure worldly might. About Kozlik, Lord of Rohacek who had eight sons and nine daughters and about the captive destined for the bishop of Hennau. Jan! Put the mare in the stable, I don't need the stallion. We have no oats to feed them. Slaughter it! Mikolas! Go away! Alexandra! Adam, give me back that chain. <i>Who is that? Who is Lazar?</i> <i>Carrion-vulture! Mange of dogs!</i> <i>Where is your reason?</i> <i>To let yourself be fleeced</i> <i>by some ghost from the road?</i> <i>I wasn't. He came and went.</i> <i>took a few chains.</i> <i>Why did you let him get away?</i> <i>Why didn't you murder the vermin?</i> <i>Without a prayer!</i> <i>He had no weapon.</i> <i>And those two,</i> <i>they didn't have any either?</i> <i>We can talk of ransom.</i> <i>And you'll go and get it?</i> <i>Or you'll invite his relations</i> <i>from Saxony here?</i> <i>They must go! Both of them!</i> <i>If his father hadn't run off</i> <i>you could've got them all.</i> Who has escaped? Come with me! And you, get out of here! Why did you hide it from me? So they escaped! No-one ever escaped from you! You dog-head! Do you know what you've done? Look! See? So? You said they had to go. We're perishing with cold. Frozen to tatters. If someone tries to get to us for example. through the window. Adam, stop! - But you said in the yard. - Do what I told you! How Kozlik fared in Boleslav with the captain of the royal regiment (this man was once a merchant who brewed from hops. They called him "Beer"). Christ, captain, you wanted. - Did the beasts run you through? - My son. The white one. see him? Do you see them? The white one! We'll have nothing to do. So? Why? Take the boys and follow the track. I left my knife and hat there. You have no reason. None at all. - You're as hard as ice! - I want a drink! Couldn't Jan go to Boleslav? You act as if you were 50! Have them wake Mikolas. They took your horses? Where's the captain? Where's your good man, people? - What do you want with him? - Lord. The master is a noble but he steals. - I come in good faith. - No, you shed blood. - You'll come to a bad end. - Don't threaten me. - Have a drink. - I came to talk. Too late - the royal patience has run out. Since when has the king bothered with poor yeomen? Even a king must drive flies from his face. You want to trap them, captain? I'm glad the regiment doesn't have to hunt you down. Guards! In vain do you vaunt, pedlar! Oh God! You old hag! What have you got against the captain? I couldn't find the chink in his armour. God's will was not with me. About the visit to the neighbour at Oboriste and what Lazar's daughter saw. Where is the master. wise people? Come out, Lazar. Welcome your guest. Or shall I help you, you fox! Welcome to Oboriste, son. Hurry up, things are looking bad. The king's captain has left Boleslav. But if we lay in wait for him together. - Near the place where. - Why me? .where I gave you your life! I've nothing to do with the king. I don't kill. You inherited that? The king knows about you, highwayman. - If his soldiers get you. - I'll redeem myself! At confession! But don't rely on royal mercy! The king is just. Those who stop his regiment will hang along the road! Gracious God, Mary and Jesus! If You are all-powerful, show Your strength at Oboriste. Make my father change. Do this! - You scoundrel! - Thieving carrion! Stop, that's enough! Leave him alone! You've made a mistake, you scoundrels. Don't you know that Kozlik has more sons than sheep? God, Marketa! Well, you wouldn't. I wouldn't be any the richer for killing him. Leave him be, let him go. Let him perish in the confessional! Such a pagan cannot speak honourably to the king. Get out of the way, fool! Marketa! Do you hear me? Don't believe him! I never spilled blood. Maybe in defence. To take what a wealthy man leaves. who isn't weak? God allows the just to trespass seven times daily as it is in Heaven. And here on Earth, what you don't take, you don't have. Don't be rash with your thoughts. Even God's love is stronger than His holy justice. Learn to forgive. Learn to forgive. Ask almighty God to forgive us. God will hear the one promised to Him. He will not refuse you. About Kozlik's retreat. From Rohacek and the fall of his son and daughter Alexandra. - Get that horse! - What is it? - Lazar's scoundrels! - All should be killed! - Father! - He deserves it! You look a sight! - Lazar will pay for this. - Leave the debts of others! - Why did he go there? - He stood against them by himself! Christian! Lazar's dogs are scared of their own wind! You're going to leave Lazar to the will of God? You want revenge? The captain's after us and you want to burn Lazar? Be silent, count. Be glad they don't see us. - We'll get you by dawn. - Lazar won't escape us. Anger melts with the snow. It'll be your shame. Don't call the Grim Reaper, get to the carts! You'll fall into the captain's hands, Jan! Harness the horses! - He's on the way to Lazar. - By the time he gets here. - He'll never find Oboriste! - Come out. Asses! Where did you see the regiment? - Half a day away. - What do you mean? - In deep snow. - Go on! Maybe it'll take a day. It won't be good if the captain settles in Oboriste. Seven, no more! That's quite enough for that Oboriste vermin! And I want Lazar alive! Do you understand? Alive! And spare the horses! Did you kill at least one, mutton-head? I didn't expect this of you. - What are you still doing here? - Bring the horses. Move it! Go on! You didn't really do away with a soul? - This is our affair. - I want him to go with us. About the campaign which became a funeral, how the captain reflected on the death of his aide who fell at the hands of the sons of Kozlik before Oboriste. He is buried at Rohacek. - You can't go into the yard! - Just to feed the coal-tits! Don't go into the courtyard! Have you no reason? Half the amount of meat would suffice. And the spices. What have I done? The granary and the larder are empty and spring is still far off! In Kozlik's league? You didn't want that! What league? Push the devil out and the demon slips in. It's frosty! The way will be firm. Like a hammer. Something is fragrant. - It's arnica. - Colt's-foot and butterbur. The marshes are frozen. Butterbur is a healer. - I know, maiden Marketa. - You're not leaving? Don't worry, I won't leave your little nest exposed. You won't catch up with Kozlik in the woods. The king's law is longer than Kozlik's course. I'm from a good line. I know what my coat-of-arms commands. Your property and Marketa are under my protection. - Dear Sovicka. - Does it hurt? - Your hand is blessed. - Such healers are rare. - God bless you! - Not a healer but an angel! - Who hurt your heart? - The Angel of mercy. You can't do that! A sincere mind does not seek words. A bird's breast weighs heavily on the knight's heart! So longs as some remains when I signal the attack. The time has come, captain. I see you mean business, marshal! Your advice always was good for nothing! What is there to advise, pedlar? You lead your regiment like cattle from shed to shed. - Some heroism! - The king needs the law upheld. The king entrusted the captain's mace to me. I travel the land waging a merchant's war. While your noble words lead you to the mortuary, one gabbles on, the other murders. What did Kozlik want? - If I sell my horses. - So you're riding now? I'm not giving my geldings mere straw. They will not last till spring. You deny us a few oats? Who knows whose they are? Royal protection isn't gratuitous - hunger follows. You do well, we know about your tricks. - Just evil tongues. - That's as may be. Don't come to a bad end like your neighbour. Catch him! Kill him! Shut the gates! Stop staring and go to bed! We didn't come here a courting. Rohacek is empty, captain. - The birds have flown! - Shall we join the trail? It's fresh. Haste is not a good helper. Why do you punish me? So many people to feed! - The horses! - Horses for the cornet! Where to put them all? They won't help us! From mud to puddles. Some reinforcements! They're travelling without provisions. You reproached me for foolishness and imprudence. You're waiting for reinforcements? You count horsemen like you count groschen. Well observed, Sovicka. Wait, that doesn't look like. But they are not. The king entrusted me with his soldiers. - Your blood has frozen, captain. - I don't pay heed to it! - Halt! - Fear is in command! Halt, you damned soul! See that fool? Won't even take a fur! - You sniffing around, captain? - Looking for silver, pedlar? - Mangy dogs! - Off to the devil with you! - But leave us Lazar! - We're lighting his way! - Devious pole-cats! - Run far from Rohacek! Or we'll slice your veins! - Just try, swine-murderer. - We'll make a gelding of you! Come out, show yourself, wretch! - I've stuffed myself enough! - You bloated pedlar! I'll find you and shove you on the stake! I'll get you all and murder you without mercy! And I'll cast your limbs into the woods, whore-mongers! - You're repulsive! - Sons of whores! God will show us the way, punishment must not delay! No soldiers will rest, nor animals, nor arms. I shall hunt them as never before. Lf, defending themselves, they are killed, I shall take their children! How Lazar, rid of his worries with his neighbour (whom the captain hunts through the woods) Gives away his daughter without a dowry. Master Lazar. His reason has been dulled. His words are unaccountable. He brays like a donkey. God has also given you a graceful daughter. And a fool instead of an heir. That is blasphemy. I give you what is most dear. She is looking forward to staying. She has bid farewell to all at home. Long yearning - great joy. She will see. It's not long before Easter. I also took the habit before our Lord rose from the dead. Don't take me for a bad man. We had a bad year. The soldiers came and you know about my neighbour. Farmers who were not affected are more affluent now. God knows her dowry must be fitting. Her casket is full, she shall have groschen. - But my estate is lost. - We are not your confessors. When the last snows are gone, you will be with us. Come, child. I shall have sheep, too. If the cloister waits. - As the good Lord is above me. - The just Lord. The all-knowing. May your house be filled with health and happiness. May your oxen thrive. Give me a groschen! - If you've something to give. - Hear him? Vagabond! My feet are frozen. The monasteries used to be poor, but now? People only take. Why are you sorry? There will be no children to carry on the line. You promised me yourself. It'll be sad here without you. What have we here? It could be mended. The Lord taketh away, the Lord giveth. See her? She's a nun! Slow down! Praise to the Lord. The thaw is coming. For the mercy of God. Boys, do not act like beasts of prey! Why do you take revenge? Mikolas! Take pity on us! Remember the Lord! Lord, have mercy on these wretches! I'll never forget this, Mikolas! Have mercy! Enough! We are at your mercy and cannot protect ourselves. Don't commit murder! - I'll redeem myself! - With what? For God's sake, no! Take what you want but don't harm Marketa! Don't be an animal! She has been promised to God! My lord enabled me to pay back my debt. Since you're tolerant and you'll be my creditor, grant us this virgin. The good Lord is glad to share her! You can't do that! Get up. Come on. He is thirsty for blood. - Why is he crying? - He mocks people and himself. They threw his mother to the wolves. <i>He grew up with the wolves</i> <i>and became one among people.</i> <i>Disdain fosters his pride,</i> <i>dislike breathes hatred.</i> <i>Scorned by all,</i> <i>Straba scorns them all in turn.</i> <i>With a grimace he disgraced</i> <i>the holy ancestral places.</i> <i>He does not want</i> <i>to be a subject of people or God.</i> <i>He's free like a wolf,</i> <i>but he has a human heart</i> <i>and that heart is full of sorrow.</i> <i>He grew up and the men</i> <i>would have him cast out.</i> <i>- Their word is law.</i> <i>- What happened to him?</i> <i>He heard the men's counsel</i> <i>and laughed.</i> <i>The quiet laugh of a wolf.</i> <i>He was beautiful -</i> <i>he chose the most comely maiden.</i> <i>She was afraid of him,</i> <i>and of her father even more.</i> <i>The father decides</i> <i>to whom you will be submissive.</i> <i>Straba raged</i> <i>and spilled blood from her throat.</i> <i>They flew upon him</i> <i>and put him in irons.</i> <i>A terrible punishment awaited him.</i> <i>The stake, said one,</i> <i>trampled by stallions, said another.</i> <i>They could not decide</i> <i>how he should die.</i> <i>Then the oldest of the line</i> <i>pronounced the sentence.</i> <i>May he have no place among</i> <i>humans, free as a wolf.</i> <i>His punishment would be in himself.</i> <i>Perun cast down lightning,</i> <i>but there were no clouds.</i> <i>And Straba?</i> <i>He laughs</i> <i>with the quiet laugh of the wolf.</i> <i>He leaves and bares his teeth</i> <i>with that laugh.</i> <i>Arrows had no power over him,</i> <i>he was free as a wolf.</i> <i>His life was not measured</i> <i>by the solstices.</i> <i>But he was alone.</i> <i>Delight passed him by,</i> <i>as it was not paid for by suffering.</i> <i>Life has no value without pain.</i> <i>At that time, he longed for pain,</i> <i>he sought death.</i> <i>He returned to that line</i> <i>that cast him out.</i> <i>But they had all grown old</i> <i>and did not know him.</i> <i>The young men flew at him with arms.</i> <i>One remembered and shouted,</i> <i>"Keep away from him!"</i> <i>He has come for death</i> <i>and we shall deny it him.</i> <i>All retreated and mocked him.</i> <i>He returned to die</i> <i>and death was denied him.</i> <i>Their mockery burned.</i> <i>He shook like an aspen leaf.</i> <i>He sought the place</i> <i>where his heart was.</i> <i>He seized the nearest knife</i> <i>and stabbed into it.</i> <i>But the knife broke</i> <i>and no blood was drawn.</i> <i>He was alone again.</i> Does he weep? No. Weeping is the gift of relief. The men know nothing about it. Their pride pursues eternal punishment. Straba is from their line. His ancestor came from the woman he wed. Shut up, old hag! Don't lure evil. All of you bear the mark of his blood. But the curse cannot touch the seventh son. What are you doing? - Why is there no guard? - The captain has crossed the ford. - Look! - Where? What disorder there is here! Where are you supposed to be? Are you guarding? Where did that whore come from? Make her wear the nails. Let her run to the devil! Why didn't you bring me Lazar?! Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it? Such dishonour! Act with chivalry! Don't torture a defenceless girl. I offer you my share of the inheritance. Christian! Get away from me! What are you doing here? Fools! You whores! Chains! Bring the chains! Part II - The Lamb Of God <i>Spring was approaching with haste.</i> <i>Shepherds and wayfarers</i> <i>began to talk animatedly</i> <i>for the sun angels</i> <i>could be heard in the wind.</i> <i>Who thought now</i> <i>of a sad maiden's tale?</i> <i>Who would heed</i> <i>the mad ramblings of louts?</i> <i>The Lord, returning</i> <i>to the welcoming lowlands,</i> <i>fixes His gaze on the simplicity</i> <i>of those who address Him.</i> <i>What are you singing?</i> <i>What are you muttering?</i> - A prayer. <i>- That's no prayer.</i> <i>It's a sermon.</i> I don't know, I don't understand. <i>Are you not dwelling</i> <i>in sodomitical sin?</i> <i>You know she's not a woman,</i> <i>as you are no lamb.</i> <i>God won't hear that!</i> <i>If only your voice were as good</i> <i>as your simplicity is great!</i> You see? The Lord is showing us the way. We'll have milk and warmth, perhaps a nice apple. Come on, don't stand there. We're just in time. Is it a christening or a wedding? In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Christ's holy intercessors lift their hands for your sins to be forgiven. The priest's prayers rise up to the clouds. What a wonderful estate you have here! <i>Step back a little.</i> <i>May this house be filled</i> <i>with health and happiness.</i> <i>Firstly, my lord.</i> <i>What is it, my little one?</i> <i>May your oxen thrive.</i> <i>Give me a groschen!</i> If you've something to give, don't leave me with nothing. My feet are frozen. I don't understand you but you have a nice lamb. Only a sheep sent to me by a higher will. But you've found yourself a nice sheepfold! - You got away in time! - From puddles to mud! St. George, a just patron. Where is the master? You're out of luck. He was nailed to the gate! And he dragged the sheep away on a string! - What are you muttering? - That you've come just in time! How Bernard found a soldier who robbed him and what became of the jests of Kozlik's sons. Oh Lord, those swines! God, don't allow. Thieves. louts. stinking swine! They've encircled me. they're strong as oxen. What are they doing? Mangy animals! Swept away to the hellish world! Keep us away from those mangy hands! Murder with terror until they are silenced! May they die! Holy Christ. my little one, where are you? Where did you put her? Did St. George help you? They'll rejoice for You have lost an impious soul. Where is my sheep? Fool! My little one. The impious are preparing their bows and arrows. His mouth is full of evil words and cunning. Your soldiering is finished, you swine! My little one! God. where are you? My little one! Where the devil? Come out! Come out I say! Foolish beast! You have no reason. The devil take you! Get out of here and take the mares with you! The birdie has been caught! Wretched beast! Outrun him! You won't escape, you fool! Faster, beast! - Kill him, the wretch! - The mares! Hold him! Use the knife! What about the catch? And the others? The carts? The provisions? - Captain! - What will I give the mares? He murdered my son. Kill him! - Stop! - Where is my son? Where have you buried him?! Stop, I tell you! You won't get away. Give me a dagger! You, get up. That's him! There's no need for haste. You belong to the yeoman they call Kozlik? Is he dumb? Tie him to the saddle! He'll lead us there. He'll get his due! - Have him thrown to the dogs! - Let us continue! I order you! What is this supposed to mean? Why should this dog live? Let us carry on! About the scourge on the chain and Mikolas' awakened memories. Alexandra's noble beloved and about the revenge of Adam, the one-armed man. Drahus! Come out! Give the falcons one each. And give the buzzard two. Hasten the beast. What are you lurking around here for? Get off home with you! You hunting without blood-hounds? He found his hunting-ground in a mouse hole! You must know that we are bound to him with fetters. Tell him we'll share this suffering. It is God's wish. My lord would like to express his thoughts. We wish to share with you the adversity of fate. It is only courteous. We hope God will praise us for it one day. <i>His blood is poisoned</i> <i>by an impure deed.</i> God marked his left arm. Exorcism did nothing. Adam will die, Kozlik! Take him out to the yard, bring Alexandra. <i>You will look into</i> <i>your brother's face until he dies.</i> Then you will be buried with him. If he is saved, you will be protected, too. <i>God will decide. the outcome.</i> Stop! Get back, you beast! Where's he dragged us? Stop! Halt! Give that here! - Leave some for the journey! - There's not far to go. We're nearly at Rohacek. Give him to us, captain! That scourge is mine! I'll do with him what I will! The king gave me a decree and you are his servant! Give the rogue up! I order you! I tell you, I won't let this through! Must we beg you, captain? About the last supper where Bernard's sheep dies and about the hour in which death governs. Who have you dragged here? You clown! And you, come out. Come out into God's light! Lament, you boars! Repent for your atrocities. Adam sends a confessor! What are you? They took my sheep. I travel the world and people give us bread. Who sent you? God. They laugh when I speak to my sheep. God's wisdom pressed us into the dust. We recognise love and the Creator in this lovely world. - Let us pray. - Wait! Not so hasty! - Pour some wine. - Where is that urchin? Don't leave him standing there. Your Simon's a lot of use! - Did you rub down the horses? - There's lots of straw. - I hope his skull freezes! - He could do it for Stepanka. Just look after the spit! - We have an unchristened child. - God bless, noble lady! If your soul is merciful, do it for us. I will. Give me grain, salt, holy water. Don't you use wine? Not always. Come here. Have some! - Am I to? - Drain the jug! To your health! - Father, I'll take you. - Thank the Lord! - This way, Father! - Very nice! He likes his drink, doesn't he? - You slumber early. - The fields are barren. - Like birds in heaven. - Are you hungry? Like a meadow lily. Like a lamb of God. Have a drink, you, with the golden voice! - Think of the children! - What do you want? - Am I to give myself up? - What will become of them? - Mind your own affairs! - God's ways are unclear! What will become of them? Wolves! If it weren't for all his aides. The captain's either died or he's run off. Where's he lurking? At our neighbour's. - You destroyed his property. - He deserved it. May God judge you. You're calling God - against whom? - May the saints protect you. - Why are you calling Him? - The captain is not far. - Do I hear you right? Are you trying to threaten me? - Think of your salvation. - Think of yours, you old witch! - Age has dulled our reason. - I don't deny my sins. I held my sword but I never harmed the defenceless. Keep quiet! My deeds will terrify me at the Last Judgment! I shall be afraid but not ashamed! I led wars with men - against the king's will. For ten years he rebuked me with armed men. I answered them as I would an enemy. My sword is not shorter than the captain's. Get up! Wake up the Father! Such rabble! My little one. Open up! I want to talk to Father. - I'm listening. - I heard the sign of the wolf. Black beasts and deer are approaching. - Get the saddles ready. - It was a warning! - Get up! - Are you not scared? Stop! Come back! Come here! Throw them the chains as a reminder. Take the horses to where the stream forks. Don't move until I say so. Take Jiri with you. No, I'll send Mikolas. Silence! Silence, I say! God be with you and hurry! Have them take the lamb with them! Why do you constantly try me? Why can I not swallow my sinful saliva? In the name of God and the king, yeoman Kozlik, known as "the Goat". The guardian of justice speaks with you. Our lord and king. Put down your arms - your iniquity is ended. Go back home to Boleslav! My gates are strong and I've lost the key! You have wronged the young bishop of Hennau. The king demands to know what you have done with him. Answer and give yourself up! The king is the lord of us all. But war is the lord of kings. War is the judge of my actions. I may defeat your troops and talk with the king's envoy. Perhaps I will be defeated and killed. According to the right of victory. May your message be carried away by the wind. Halt! War is declared and I have no scribe! Thieving louts! If you do not yield, you will be killed! And your family will be starved! Before I storm your castle, I'll kill one of yours as a warning! He is my captive, I'll bring him to the emperor! I know nothing of the emperor! - Take him, boys. - We will bargain! If you wrong my son, they'll need a new bishop! What are you waiting for? Finish him off! My son, he lives! Negotiate with them, captain! Back - don't move! I want my son! Away from him! Kill him, Father! Into line! My son! Into line. Get back! Here you are! Stupid, mangy, foolish! Cornet! Kill them! Get them and come back! Get what you can! The animals! What have you got in your hands? - Make a ladder! - Change mounts! Dismount, dismount! Get them all into one! Get the ropes! I'll show you! See that? How love guided the bishop of Hennau and about the soliloquy of madmen. Kill her! Murderess! She's a witch! She has bewitched you with her magic! - Renounce her! - She's having my child. You fool! Concubine! I know you better than your own heart! Leave that fury! What do you want with her? Her hair is full of lice and she is evil smelling! Let her run! They got you drunk. the beasts! Have some. It won't do you any harm. You haven't got a bit of salt, have you? We defend ourselves in need, like a she-bear and at another time we'll fall upon you like a lynx! Why do you appeal to God? They made a lout into a lord. Get up! Let's go and find shelter. Once they invited me to supper in a monastery. It was Easter. Whores of Herod! Louts with swords to cast out a beggar. What was its name? The monastery was on the Turnov road. You don't know it? Suddenly it was full of soldiers, I was hungry. Captain! Cornets. Drums. Bad farmers clear woods - bad kings start wars. Don't make such noble faces. You're all pagans. In a Boleslav inn they tried to stifle me! Such henchmen they were! Stop staring like a fish! Can you hear me? Stop staring. Christ! Saviour! Dear Virgin! Give him water. His head was cracked in two. But he didn't even dismount his horse. He just put loam on his wound and rode home! - The gallows await him. - You mean the axe! Noble blood gets the sword. On the fate of men and the lot of widows. Mistress Katerina! It's master Mikolas! Praise be to God, at least you are here! Come and rest! We haven't got that horse any more. - I didn't expect. - You don't know whether. What about Jiri? - And Burjan? - Did you see mine? Yes I did. - Eat this. - Are you fishing? - Whatever the flood brings. - I'd sell some in Boleslav. What are you thinking of? We wouldn't get past the gates without wares. - Why Boleslav? - Is he alive? He's no use otherwise. I know what Kozlik would command. We'll go in with a basket of fish. Like farmers and we'll charge the prison. He'd tell you to hide from the king's wrath and return later to build Rohacek again. Attack the prison with stones? We two? One wolf defeats a pack of dogs when the time is right. We'll storm Boleslav! Stick to fishing - with the regiment! Kozlik is dead. If not, he will receive the axe. No power but God's will drag him from death! - Then God will guide us. - He sinned like soldiers. Wish him a peaceful death to pay for his sins. You want the executioner to take him? We are both old and we await death. You protect yourselves and your line. Allow the aged a peaceful grave. Remember the living! The young shall sow the seeds. Continue along this road. Go, return home. I took you from Oboriste against your will. No-one will reproach you. Go, soften Lazar and wait. I know everything that happened, that you are sad, that you love me but we must save Kozlik from dishonour. Your names are signed in hell - be accursed! - Don't blaspheme! - May you never know peace! Don't call God. He'll hear you! Their time had come. Kozlik said, "Take the arrows." I went to him, I couldn't see the way. They called to each other. When their time comes, they battle for a mate. - To overcome her? - No, a mate calls his mate. - And she? - She submits to the stronger. Forever? - Only people know. - And the defeated? He knew. our scent. Kozlik wouldn't have me shoot him. - Why is he called "the Goat"? - We always called him that. - He once beat me hard. - What happened then? His antlers were bigger than branches. He looked at us without fear. Kozlik motioned for silence, we went nearer. It moved off and we went after it. Below the hillside was a bare plain. Grass, stones, lichen. This valley was more wretched than a cemetery. Bones, limbs - a thousand antlers on white skulls. He stood alone in the middle. Defeated, alone. Kozlik whispered, "Look, the solitude of death." He lifted his horn and blew into it. - Who did he call to battle? - Silence! Just a moment longer. Take Alexandra with you. Your eyes are far away where punishment awaits. What about me? We haven't given up yet. I will be judged again and again, even if I am wronged. Do not talk of punishment and prepare the wedding. My brothers will bring you a message from me. God made me love you. You are my wife. Welcome. You are. Get back. You whores! Get out! This is not the time to return. What are you doing here? He sent you. You could have come long ago but you liked to sin! You're his concubine! Look! I cannot look at you writhing in ashes. - I didn't leave of my own will. - Really? Who defended me? You come with reproach instead of repentance? I came for you to judge me. Do not judge and you will not be judged. Ask God for more humility. You have not renounced him. Go! You broke your vow to God! You are not fit even to feed the swine! You'll be back, the pain will pass. I'll speak for you when the time is opportune. Wait! What have you done? - Murderess! My child! - What are you saying? You were my guiding light. <i>Do not abandon me,</i> <i>Lord, my Saviour.</i> Remember not my sins, but remember me, by Your mercy. <i>Though my parents have left me,</i> <i>your hand welcomes me.</i> <i>. for my wrongs have risen</i> <i>above my head like a stone.</i> <i>I cannot bear them.</i> You measured the days, nothing lies before You.

Mikolas, do you take Marketa, daughter of Lazar, I bind your hands with the sanctity of matrimony. Whom God has joined, may no man put asunder. Let's go! You were my dearest. What have we here? Greetings. Just in time, we'll find something better. Stand still, my little one. It was mournful at Oboriste. Stand still! I found her, starved. What are you doing here? Come on, let us three wander together. God will find shelter for us. It'll be merry in winter. What do you say? Where are you off to? Marketa! Stop, I say! Where are you running? Wait! I'll beat you with my stick. Is that all the thanks I get for saving you from a knife? Marketa! Stop, you smelly goat, stop! Wait!

We believe the country is ready for communication like this. Absolutely. Remember, the citizens have increased demands about the truth, and what they want. Let's be honest: Today, Chile is thinking of its future. Let's watch. <i>The new soft drink has arrived!</i> <i>It's young, liberated, and Free!</i> <i>The time has come</i> <i>The time is right for Free </i> <i>It's what you were waiting for</i> <i>It was made for you</i> <i>And now, Free!</i> <i>Refresh yourself now!</i> <i>And feel Free!</i> <i>Free like you</i> <i>Now, you. Now, Free!</i> It's OK, but. Why the fuck is there miming in my film? When did we talk about miming? There is no doubt that. that it is very well done, You can see the effort. Carlos, This is very, very, very original. It might work in the US, but we have to trust our product. We have a product different to the competition. It invites you to be young, and be brave. If you're brave, you're Free. I think. This is everything our youth needs. Music, a rebellion, an idyll. But with order and respect. Excuse me. There's a Mr. Urrutia. No, we're in a meeting. He's here. Here? Please go and see. Go on. OK. Take a look at the 30-second version. There's no miming in it. Thanks. Jos√© Tom√°s Urrutia? Yes. The communist? Yes. What do you want? You've become very fucking important. No wonder you won't take my calls now. I work. What's going on? How's Vero doing? Well, I suppose. What can I do for you? I'm working on the campaign for the referendum. I know. For the NO campaign, of course. Everyone knows. What does everyone know? That you're with the NOs, and you want me to do the campaign. Who? Me. You? Yes. Me. No. Besides. Why are you bothering with it? This election is rigged from the outset. Listen, international pressure has forced Pinochet to agree to an opposing campaign. This is our chance to overthrow the dictatorship. So, Pinochet set up a referendum in order to lose it. No, be serious, I'm being serious, man. Pinochet could win this vote without cheating, if he wants. Really? That's what's so terrible. Legally? People either vote for him or not at all. No, let's take a cab. We'll take a bus. A political campaign takes up a lot of time. A lot of people. A good team. Of course, but the campaign is in the hands of experts in political communication who know their job and do it well. Let me tell you that at first, I wasn't too sure, but they've surprised me. Good people, responsible, capable. What I need, man. is an external opinion. An opinion! Just an opinion from me? I wouldn't even give you that. Calm down, man. No! I didn't know you were pals with that communist. Urrutia's no communist. Yes he is. No. He was my classmate. I know him. No, he's not a communist. What is he, then? He's the other. Christian Democrat? No. Socialist? No! It doesn't matter, they're all forms of communism. No, I know Urrutia from. He's a family friend. Are you going to tell me how microwave works? It's laser technology. Invisible heat, and you say "a" microwave. A microwave. Yes. You were offered the NO campaign? Are we going to talk about that or about a microwave? You tell me, dickwad. Yes. Yes, but I said no, I didn't have the time, I had my hands full, and I couldn't. I'm only going to give them my opinion. Even if it hurts you. Thank you. You're such a showoff, asshole. Loads of people are offering me work. Freelance. With your family background, I never should have hired you. You'd have passed up a goldmine. And what about you? Forget my loyalty to Pinochet. Please be coherent. You didn't share that goldmine with the communists. Enough with the communists, old lady. An old lady? No, an old man. Who's on board with the campaign? I don't know. Did they call anyone from abroad? No, just me I think. You? Yes. But you've been away for ages. What do you know about it? Nothing. Do they have money? No. The communists don't have money. It's not them. Oh no? So who is it then? Everyone but the communists. Not the communists. Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet Union didn't put any money in. No. The Americans did. No, they're on our side. And yet they did it. The CIA financed the coups and are supporting us. How much are they paying you? The Americans are with the NO. .for public spaces, we've designed some posters. This doesn't mean that these are the definitive ones: "If I govern, you govern" "YES, for a winning country" "We are millions." Lucho Guzman. Explain to us your theory about reactionary people. No, Minister. What I meant to say is that the concept of dictatorship packs a strong punch. And that on top of that, now they're going to say it on TV. 15 minutes of screen time. 15 minutes of TV split into different opinions lost in the middle of the night. That's what the opposition has. The YES camp will have those 15 minutes and all of the remaining time, too. They didn't have that platform before. Platform? How many parties are there? Seventeen. It'll be chaos. They'll fight like cat and dog. The general is respected everywhere. Even the biggest hypocrites know he's modernized this country. Do you know what I've heard my fellow Argentineans say? "We want a Pinochet." Everyone wants a Pinochet. Show him. You control the radio, the newspapers, television. But. we have to get him out of uniform, and compose an elegant, very Chilean anthem, for the people to sing with pride, to the general in a suit. That spells trouble. How about in black tie? I prefer him in a suit. I think we should take advantage of his blue eyes, his smile. We'd need to test it, Minister, to be sure. I'd make him wear a pearl. It's very elegant. I'll have to talk to him. Pinochet out of uniform is a government without soldiers, in other words, progress. This country's progress has been stunning. It's not like Latin America. You don't realize the. your influence in the world. But these "gauchos" keep protesting. The country is full of ingrates. They forgot everything. So scare them. Excuse me? You've lost me. Shouldn't we show a nicer face? If you want to scare people, scare them with their past. Their past of poverty, endless queues for bread. The opposition misses socialism, but the only thing people care about is handouts. They know socialism makes them unhappy. Here, you have a system in which anyone can get rich. Careful, not everyone. But anyone. You can't lose when everyone is dreaming about being that anyone. Move, dammit! Move, you idiot! Free the political prisoners! Free them all! Why just some of them? Veronica! Fucking cops! Stop it! Why are you hitting her? You're hitting a woman! Out! How can you hit a woman? Let her go, motherfucker! Let her go, asshole! Let go of me! How much longer? How much longer, for fuck's sake? That's right. Turn the news on. OK. There. <i>Free the nation</i> <i>from frayed populist paths</i> <i>and economical stagnation</i> <i>and lead it to modernization</i> <i>and progress for all Chileans.</i> <i>Augusto Pinochet Ugarte.</i> <i>from a very young age </i> <i>showed his love for serving his country,</i> <i>influenced by the stories</i> <i>of the nation's forefathers</i> <i>which set ablaze his courage,</i> <i>and made him enter the military.</i> <i>From dawn to dusk,</i> <i>he worked tirelessly.</i> <i>Give me that.</i> <i>.Devoting all of his time,</i> <i>his attention and his energy.</i> <i>He sacrificed himself.</i> <i>He endured everything</i> <i>to accomplish his mission</i> <i>to save Chile.</i> <i>Iorana, President</i> <i>Hear the voices of your people</i> <i>Thank you for coming</i> <i>Ariki Nui</i> <i>Carmen!</i> <i>For being here, Ariki Nui</i> <i>Ariki Nui</i> <i>Iorana, President</i> <i>We will always be here</i> <i>Thank you for giving us</i> <i>A home to live in</i> <i>Ariki Nui, Ariki Nui</i> <i>Mahu Ariki Nui</i> <i>My main concern</i> <i>is.</i> <i>not losing what we've won.</i> <i>That's what matters.</i> This is for Simon, OK?

No. That kid understands everything. No, he doesn't get any of it. Neither do I, to tell you the truth. The maid can't do everything. You're going to work for the NO? To do what? To win. You'll legitimize Pinochet's sham. You'll say yes, he's my president. this is my constitution. Mercenary. The boy has to get up at 7am. Why don't you stay tonight? We'll have breakfast together. OK. Are they paying you well? I can't complain. Oh, well. Let me give him a kiss, please. Go ahead. I love you, sweetheart. We're going to get rid of Pinochet. <i>WAR PRISONERS MEETING POINT</i> <i>34,690 TORTURED</i> <i>200,000 EXILED</i> <i>2,110 POLITICAL EXECUTIONS</i> <i>1,248 DISAPPEARED DETAINEES</i> <i>FOR FREE ELECTIONS</i> <i>VOTE NO</i> Right. Ren√©, we're listening. Is that all? I think so, isn't it? Sorry. There's nothing else? Something else? Something else. Something a little lighter. A little nicer. Comrade, do you think that what's going on in Chile is nice? No. Let's see. It moves me as it moves all of you. However, I think that it's not very appealing. Well. Let's try. Let's try, from both sides, to give more constructive opinions. Me too? Everyone. Let's give our opinions, and move on. I'd like to know if anyone thinks we can win with this campaign. I think the main objective. Excuse me? We must open the eyes of those who don't want to vote. That's the main objective. Dictatorship has destroyed this country and will continue to destroy it, with its economic success and 40% of the population living below the poverty line. We all agree we want to win the referendum, but some only want to win, without really reforming Chile. We want another kind of victory. But the advertiser asked a different question. Our comrade asked if you think that we're going to win. The answer is no. We don't think that we're going to win. The referendum was lost from the moment the fascist right called for it. Then why pitch this campaign? To raise awareness and fill the spaces the dictatorship had to open, and which we won. Let us fill them. Exactly. Let them allow us to win, maybe, but let them accept us. If we already lost, we should give up. This referendum is a fraud, we know it. Dad, what are you doing? I'm working. This isn't work, you're playing. Hand me the rocket. It's over there. I'm going to put it together! Really? It's already put together. Then I'm going to drive it. Stop it, please. I want to play with my train. Go to bed. Abstentions: 35.1%, 146. "YES" votes: 19%. Abstainers: 76,2%. That's it. Thank you. What do you think of this? A feeling of false hope, deeply internalized, preventing the voters from feeling free at the moment of voting, because they're completely repressed. As a result, with so many unanswerable questions, the results are quite unsure. As for the fear, it is significantly increasing the number of undecided voters. These two are the undecided groups, no? Those who don't know if they'll vote? Yes. It's impossible. You can't make a campaign with such extremes. Their interests are too different. It's impossible. How impossible, would you say? We need a miracle. I think you've said the key word. We need a miracle. In other words, God, and His celestial army, angels and archangels. Faith. That's what's going to change Chile. This country needs a divine act. How are you? Fine. I don't want to lose any clients. Or get beat up. Nobody will know. I'm not here. Jos√© Tom√°s, Alberto Arancibia. Inside this rat lurks my mentor, my best friend. He came but "he's not here." OK? Don't worry, I understand. Can I get you a drink? Would you like that? We have a group of undecided voters who, in reality, would vote NO. But the indecision involves whether to vote or not. What? They're the old ladies, around 60 or 65 years old, middle class, or lower middle class. They are scared of what NO represents, a return to socialism, to recession, to queues and all that. And there's the young people who think that this election is fixed, and it's useless. We have to find a solution. No, a product. We need a product that is sufficiently appealing to old ladies and to young people. Ms. Carmen? Do you have a second? We'd like to ask you something. While we were chatting, Ren√© told us that you're voting YES. Is that true? She's voting YES. Her silence shows that she's voting YES. Could you tell us why? I'm doing fine. My son is in college. My daughter has work. And what about the dead, the tortured, and the disappeared? What do you think about that? It's not that I don't care about it, but that's all in the past. Democracy is the future. My General says we can have an opinion thanks to this vote. Democracy is the problem. The old man's taken hold of the term "democracy." We haven't worked that much, we spent our time walking and eating. That's work, too, Jos√© Tom√°s. Isn't it, Alberto? No! We haven't talked about what defines us as an opposition: human rights, exile, injustice, arbitrary arrests, torture, disappearances. All the pain we've lived through. We didn't even mention it. We have to. It's got nothing to do with it. We must talk about it. It's too dark. That's fear. We can't bombard folks with fear. They're scared. Terrorized. We have to find a product that appeals to people. Democracy isn't a product. Fine, let's call it a concept. We have to offer something pleasing, but which has meaning, something. happy. Let's list everything that's happy. Happiness, joy, fulfillment. Yes, but what is.? Springtime, parties. The calm after the storm. To me, democracy's fun. It's appealing. It's something. attractive to experience. A fun product. Then happiness itself. Of course. What's happier than happiness? Nothing. Happiness in itself is happy. What's happier than that? Come on, we need to be serious here. If you think I'm going to stand there in front of all the whole coalition, and say our campaign will be based on jokes, and happiness, you're nuts. It's totally na√Øve and disrespectful. We have to consider their pain, their neglect. Where is that? How am I going to tell them that our concept is happiness? Why not? How's it going? They're there. Pass me the. Now? Thank you. You're welcome. They're here. I'm on it. Hey, Diego. This is what we have. I like these ones best. And Guzman? Is he watching you? Is he watching me? How? No, he won't know how. Great. Is he here or not? No. Fine. Look, here he is. Fernando. How are you? It's good to see you. Ren√© Saavedra, Fernando Costa. We know each other. Really? Through work. I've rescued him before. He's going to work with us as a director. You know very well that I don't do that. You've done it a thousand times. I don't know, call up a rocker, a folk singer, someone to write an anthem. No. I want a jingle. No art, no folk, no pop, no rock, a jingle. Do you really think they'll let us go out on air? Yes. They'll throw us in jail! We don't know. We don't? We don't know. The key thing is all being here. Thanks. Many wouldn't have dared. Listen, if you draw a line with this vote, what's left? No more! No more Pinochet and dictatorship! Well? It could work! It's perfect, man. No more torture, no more deaths. No more censorship. No more abuse. No more debt, no more interest, no more unpaid bills. How's things with you? We need more people, more time. More content. We have to fill 15 minutes every day for a month. They fill each day. 3 weeks to go and we got nothing. 15 minutes is too much! We better get to work. That one. It's finished. See you at the production office. Yeah, he's coming. How are you, Lucho? We're about to begin. Is everything OK? Yeah. How are you? Fine. Great. Weren't you going to give it up? It's just advice. Don't bullshit me, man. You have an easy life with your son, your own house, a sports car, plenty to eat. No one has bothered you since you got here. Let's be partners. I'll cut you in on the agency. You're a rat, boss. Why? You threaten me and you offer me. Hello. How are you? How are you? How about those dishes! They're great! We're ready for you. We'll be right over. Whenever you say! A partnership? Yes. A good percentage. I'm going to do this anyway. That camp. Hello. How are you? Nice of you to come. Hello. You look nice. Thank you. I'm handling everything, it's all fine. Excellent, thank you. This is suicide, don't be an idiot. Fire me. First positions! Get out. Fire me! Get out! Fire me! Leave. Go ahead, fire me. Think about my offer. It's good. Fine. We're done here. It's perfect. What is it? Important accounts from the state broadcaster. I'll talk with the bitch. Where is she? Over there. It's great, isn't it? It's perfect. Everything OK? Is it working? Yes. Is it? Chicken. Mind the radiation. Don't get too close. I'll stay away. Yes. I don't think this thing's very safe. You OK with the skirt? Yes, I feel comfortable. Good. Great. Everything suits you. It's really good. It's beautiful. What dish did you choose? What? What dish did you choose? We'll start with dessert. We're getting ready to shoot. First of all, I'd like to say that what you're about to see fits with the current social context. After all, today, Chile is thinking of its future. Let's go. <i>They say what they like</i> <i>I have freedom of thought</i> <i>Because I feel it's time</i> <i>To find freedom</i> <i>We're tired of the abuse</i> <i>It's time to change</i> <i>We're done with poverty</i> <i>I'm going to say NO</i> <i>Chile</i> <i>Happiness is coming</i> <i>Chile</i> <i>Happiness is coming</i> Is that all you have? Because. This is all we have as, let's say, a draft. This is the campaign. It's like an ad for Coca-Cola. It's more than that! With all due respect, we're doing something much more serious. I was also exiled. He's Manuel Saavedra's son, I don't know if you know him. Everyone knows Manuel Saavedra. We're using advertising language that is universal, familiar, attractive, optimistic, but with a political concept behind it. Ricardo. Look, Jos√© Tom√°s, I understand perfectly well that there's advertising semiology. This is a campaign. We must be pragmatic. We are, by getting involved in a referendum held for the dictatorship. We're taking big risks, we have no idea what's going to happen. I understand. But I also understand that there are ethical limits. What's your name? Ren√© Saavedra. Ren√©. I knew your father very well. Ren√©, maybe in your editing room, making ads for big corporations, you've lost a little perspective. We have physically suffered the violence of this dictatorship. My brother has disappeared, my best friends' throats cut. This is a campaign of silence. We understand, and for good reason, your pain, and the pain of all of those involved. But you're missing a key point. I'm not an idiot, Jos√© Tom√°s. I get what this is about. This is legitimization. This is a campaign to silence what has really happened. I'm shocked, Fernando. I'm sorry, comrade and friend of mine, you're involved in this shit. I see here what you really are. Those images are what you are. I see your point, but understand. I understand perfectly well! But I will not be party to something for which history will never forgive us! So you can go fuck yourself, asshole. Go get fucked, yourself. Excuse me. Listen. Yes. Where are the parties in this? They're here, in this idea. I see all the parties, but you explain it better. The rainbow represents all the political parties? Is that the idea? Yes, they're all there. It's all in the rainbow. All the party colors and political tendencies are there. For example: the red, which is very powerful, represents the radicals, communism. Socialism! Sorry, socialism. There's blue, that's very. The most hopeful one, for the Christian Democrats. The green is totally. Social Democrat. Orange for the Humanists, and all those who feel included in that. The PPD can also feel included. All the colors are there. And they all, democratically, bring their differences to the NOs. I'll go on foot. Comrade? Are you ashamed to be with us? Goodbye, brave one! Don't be an asshole! You misunderstand our politicians. Some are worth the bother. Please! They all want out while they can. We already got what we wanted. Now it's time to work! Excuse me, Ren√©, I don't mean to be a pain, but what is this shit? Are you selling chickens? It's something else, Veronica. Then, this is it. NO, orange, NO, singing bird, NON, petit arbre. NO, mental age of 5. No, it's not that. Shit! This. NO, rainbow. Almost. That one, yes. Almost. OK. Something like. Yes. Looks good on you. But we're going to win. With that? Yes. With that. Sure. Where were you, man? I was at the station. They want the title to be: "Hair Salon Love." No, that's really bad. Really bad. Too menopausal. Can I have that? Thank you. You've got a lot of nerve. This is going to make us famous. A rainbow? Yes, a rainbow. But it's for faggots, isn't it? No, I think it has to do with the flag of the Mapuche people. Gay Mapuches? No, Mapuche Indians. Do you know why you're paranoid? Because you've got homosexual communists there in your office. No Mr. Minister, in my office. there are no homosexuals nor commies. Don't worry about it. No-one will see that propaganda. You think? Of course. Everyone will be sleeping. I'm sleeping at that time. Me too. See? Everyone's sleeping. Who's behind the NO campaign? I don't know any of those people. Who are they? People too much at ease for me. Be careful what you say, Guzman. If I open that door you have to close your eyes. Give me that. Stay here. MARXIST TRAITOR Don't go out! Carmen! What are you doing? What are you doing here? Go to bed. Go! This is a nice neighborhood. Go to bed, Ma'am! Go to bed, you old bitch! Brats. Let's go inside, Carmen. Did you see them? Do you know them? I saw them up close. What happened? We were all threatened last night. Not me, as no-one knows I'm here. Why are you surprised? They know where we live and work, they know everything. Calm down, we'll be fine. The eyes of the world are watching us. I've been being followed for ages. It's normal that they follow us. It means we're doing well. We're getting to them. We have to go to the theater. The actors are waiting. Let's go. Let's go again! From the top! Come on. From the top. This is a positive message, isn't it? With happiness and. Smiling. As much as you can. We'll try. Like "We Are The World". Up there. No. Nothing like that! No. That was never.

And what if we mention it's been 15 years since we've had a show that is dissident? Yes, of course. There's. the greeting, right? The slogan is "Happiness is coming." "Chile, happiness is coming." "Hello. Chile, happiness is coming." No, actually. "Chile, happiness is coming" and "hello" after. Weird, right? Yes, but I think it works. And then, "It's been 15 years since." Exactly.

It's appalling. We're throwing our money away. I don't think it's that bad. It's more serious than the others'. My General was very offended. They attacked him personally. It's a mockery. How can we stop this humiliation? It would be a scandal. It would legitimize us internationally. That's what the referendum is for. I don't understand what the problem is. The strategy's driving force was its economic achievement. It has nothing to do with that. We can't fight universal principles like joy or that dumb campaign, a rainbow, with a film about fruit exports. We have strictly followed the client's guidelines. The two premises were: that no-one would see the campaign, and the president couldn't lose. Minister, you said the campaign didn't matter. The president is going to win anyway. Let's cut the bullshit. For fuck's sake. Guzman will from now be in charge of the campaign. It's an honor, Minister. We'll deal with those bastards later. Don't worry, Sir. The NO film'll run out of steam in a couple of days. These people are using advertising tricks, you see? We have to work on one axis: who is capable of governing, and who isn't. We must carry out an audit immediately. I'm sorry, Guzman, but. what do you mean by that? That we're going to screw them. Excuse me? We're going to screw them. <i>Our Father, Holy God</i> <i>today we bless Your name.</i> <i>The fraternal, progressive climate </i> <i>created by Pinochet's government</i> <i>has meant</i> <i>that in April 1987, </i> <i>Pope John Paul II</i> <i>will finally visit</i> <i>our country.</i> <i>Do not be afraid to look at Him!</i> Your campaign is a copy. <i>Love always conquers!</i> A copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy. Fine. We didn't copy. You mixed rainbows, pretty people, blonde children skipping, celebrating I-don't-know-what. A tall man who's 15 feet tall. Where did you find him? Denmark? Who is that guy? Us Chileans are small. Who are all these people laughing, celebrating? Celebrating what? Us getting screwed in the referendum? I don't know where you think you are. We should do something. I don't want to fuck. After, you'll make a scene. Don't say that! We've done nothing for years. You've got a bad memory. What? Last time, you didn't want to do it. Simon was there. He was sleeping. <i>This is a normal scene</i> <i>in the life of this man.</i> <i>At sunrise or sunset.</i> <i>He always works tirelessly.</i> <i>His time, his energy,</i> <i>the sacrifice of incomprehension,</i> <i>he gives it all to his initial cause.</i> <i>In his words:</i> <i>"For Chile, everything."</i> Don't get up. Shit, I've got to go. Why don't you stay? I can't. Simon needs you. I fell asleep, that's all. Don't get confused. Go on. Stay. What for? Did you pay the school? Yes. With my Allende Foundation grant. Stop it. Bye. Stay. We're pulling Pinochet off the screen. You agree? Let's protect him. Too many soldiers. Too many tacky women. Tacky? Too tacky, too fat. Too many colonels' wives. You don't have enough material. Let's talk about them. About the politicians? No, them. Their campaign is very funny. It's amusing. Shall we add a little humor? <i>Say YES!</i> <i>Dear NO supporters,</i> <i>don't waste your time with lies</i> <i>and fantasies</i> <i>as you have up until now.</i> <i>To us,</i> <i>it is a duty</i> <i>to expose to the country</i> <i>some of the NO camp's lies.</i> <i>THE LIE</i> <i>"Mrs. Yolita" ad.</i> <i>THE TRUTH</i> <i>The protagonist was paid.</i> <i>She has 3 houses,</i> <i>and one business property.</i> God, how awful! We're not going to respond. Who is doing this? OK? I'm going. All right, good luck. Call me when you get home, OK? It's really annoying. What happened? They followed me. Everybody calm down. They're just trying to scare us. It's too dangerous. Do we have any empty boxes? Or tapes? Yes, we do. Here. We'll leave with this, all at the same time. Let me go out first. Hand me the original. You're sure? The National TV Council? Come in. This is the NO campaign. Sign the form. Here? Yes. And I'll give you. a receipt. Receipt. Very well. Sir.? Ren√© Saavedra. Thank you. Tomorrow's.

This is censorship. We have to go on air. Or people will get scared. Let's hold a press conference, and denounce it. I'm sick of your fucking denouncements! We must be more creative and turn this around. NO CENSORSHIP <i>Chile</i> <i>Happiness is coming</i> <i>Hello.</i> <i>Through these programs,</i> <i>we have realized</i> <i>that it's important</i> <i>to say things how they are.</i> <i>Expressing oneself</i> <i>and talking is a good thing.</i> <i>Censorship is pointless.</i> <i>Why censor?</i> <i>But for 15 years,</i> <i>a large part of this country</i> <i>was prevented from</i> <i>doing what we've done</i> <i>on this show.</i> <i>NO-EWS</i> <i>Public opinion</i> <i>has unanimously condemned</i> <i>the censorship</i> <i>of the opposition's television program.</i> <i>During last Monday's NO campaign,</i> <i>a judge was prevented from appearing</i> <i>who confirmed the CNI's involvement</i> <i>in over 50 cases of torture.</i> <i>It was wrong.</i> <i>Why?</i> <i>Because they are hiding</i> <i>what really happened.</i> <i>It's very frustrating. Very.</i> <i>You realize everything is fake.</i> <i>It's an outrage,</i> <i>a daily outrage.</i> <i>The government</i> <i>is afraid of us knowing the truth.</i> <i>They wanted to stop the NO show.</i> <i>It's unfair.</i> <i>It is bad.</i> <i>They just do what they want.</i> <i>Yet another injustice.</i> <i>It doesn't suit them</i> <i>for the truth to be known.</i> <i>Why don't we have the right to see</i> <i>what has been going on in this country?</i> <i>Democratically, we have the right</i> <i>to be freely informed.</i> <i>That's what I think.</i> <i>How are you, Saavedra?</i> <i>How's Simon?</i> <i>I like your little train.</i> Simon? Are you ok? Yes. Hi, darling. Hi, Mommy. Hello. How are you? Here. Be a good boy. OK. Listen to your mother. Don't go out by yourself, you hear me? They're doing this because you hit the old man hard. I love you, sweetie. It's all good. Congratulations. Hello. Did you have breakfast? No. Would you like some? No, thanks. If you need anything, just let me know. You work with the YES camp? No. No, it's. it's just advisory. Did you see it? There's a change in the conceptual strategy. Did you like it? It's bad. Real bad. It's awful, Lucho. It's a huge pile of shit. It's the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy. It's all mixed together there. How will people remember this campaign? The employees made the NO campaign, and you bosses made the YES one. That's how it's going to be. We're going to screw you. So shut up, asshole, and look after your son. Don't threaten me. I'm just saying. If they want cash, let me talk. Hello. Hello Ren√©. How are you? Shall we go? How's it going, Pedro? "Beautiful" in a classic, powerful font. And "Bold" in something youthful, more playful. Most viewers will watch this soap opera. What we want to do is produce a marketing event to present the soap opera Beautiful and Bold on the Santa Maria tower. We want to avoid a typical soap opera ad filmed with crappy lighting. It makes it look cheap and ugly. We want to create a news story, and insert it under camouflage, into the evening news program. Perfect! The girls will be on the terrace, on the heliport. All the actresses, dressed in their best clothes, doing a photo shoot. We can reuse the pics from the shoot. We can use them twice. We'll also have the soap's heartthrobs, the actors, dressed like. James Bond. But with more of an "action" feel and more modern. We'll have the models and the actresses showing off their best features. And a helicopter flying around the tower with the soap opera's main heartthrob leaning right out with a bunch of roses for the girls. Wave to them! No, the election is under control. Don't worry, Guzman. But they're making noise. They could hinder any measures you take. <i>They'll happen anyway.</i> Ensure their name is mud, expose those clowns for what they are. This will upset the NO camp. Who are all these people? We couldn't find any artists. They're all with them. This is all that's left. The bottom of the barrel. That's enough. I'm leaving. <i>The idea is that,</i> <i>no matter what your option is,</i> <i>or who you vote for, ou pour qui vous votez,</i> <i>the important thing is what you feel</i> <i>through these TV programs.</i> <i>The lady</i> <i>will ask questions</i> <i>and the idea is to build a debate.</i> <i>The NO camp seem too serious,</i> <i>too strange.</i> <i>They talk about problems</i> <i>that concern old people.</i> <i>Matilde,</i> <i>tell us about the YES campaign.</i> <i>I thought it was too violent</i> <i>and underhand.</i> <i>Underhand.</i> <i>What is your name?</i> We need more testimonials. No, more humor. Did you like the NO campaign? To make it more fun and more inclusive. Be careful with that letter! Turn off that light! Pay attention for a moment! Thank you all for coming. We're very happy. The soldiers will be proud to see their musicians, actors, and artists committed to the NOs. We can shoot. 24 frames per second with a 2.8 lens. Closer, Marco Antonio, please. Let's do it. We must put on a good show. OK? Show me happiness. Sound? Rolling. Camera? Speed. 36, take one! Mark. Action! <i>Chile, happiness is coming!</i> <i>This land</i> <i>was not a propitious place</i> <i>for warlords and strikes.</i> <i>The new democracy.</i> <i>Is it OK?</i> <i>Or not?</i> <i>No.</i> <i>It's no good.</i> <i>He abandons his uniform</i> <i>for regular clothes.</i> <i>After so much hatred and threats,</i> <i>he now offers peace.</i> <i>He is alone.</i> <i>He alone speaks.</i> <i>What would you say to a dictator?</i> <i>15 years ago,</i> <i>the dictatorship began here,</i> <i>and we've had it up to here!</i> <i>But it ends now.</i> <i>My love, say yes.</i> <i>No.</i> <i>Say it for me.</i> <i>Come on, say yes!

Where are you going? Where are you going, Saavedra? She's my wife! Go home. Hello. The officer in charge? Yes, Colonel. She's here, they told me. Thanks, Lucho. Don't worry, I'd have done it for any of my people. Happiness, huh? My congratulations. Unbeatable. Thank you very much. It's quite alright. <i>Hello.

Of course they want to win, but they can't. They can't, right? I don't think so. Easy, now. I didn't want to say it out loud, but apparently, the old fucker refuses to accept the results. The cops are leaving. I don't understand. Maybe Ricardo knows. They've all gone? Simon! Come. It's a self-coup! Get out the torches. They want to screw us! We have to back up the computers. What's the procedure? For those counting votes by hand, you are each responsible. They're robbing us! There's foreign journalists everywhere. So? It'll be OK. Will the foreigners help? We need help! Let's call some journalists! International help or we're screwed! This is critical. We cannot lose. Jos√© Tom√°s! Listen! Our parallel count shows that we won. This can't go on. They're trying to buy some time. This may keep happening more and more frequently. We don't know anything either. Fucking military!

Therefore. long live Chile! <i>Chile</i> <i>Happiness is coming!</i> Did you see that? Up there! Thank you. We are happy. Chile wins.

First of all, I'd like to say that what you're about to see fits with the current social context. We believe the country is ready for communication like this. Absolutely. Let's be honest: Today, Chile is thinking about its future. Alright?

They've got night blindness. I saw it in the transit camp. It's vitamin deficiency from starvation. Here, here. You planning on surviving on half rations, son? Look, he's an old man. I'm an old man. I'll be alive in the morning. He won't. Kindness. That can kill you here. He's American. In Here? How? Stalin hates foreigners, and that includes Poles. You're Polish, no? Uh-huh. I like you Poles. Your burning sense of injustice, the yearning for freedom. Khabarov-- Andrei Timofeyevich. Weiszczek-- Janusz. Your charge, may I ask, Janusz? 58-10. A spy. That's what they told me. Ten years? No. 20. 58-14. Sabotage. Ten years. And you were on Soviet side of line, and they arrest you. They accuse you of spying. Torture you, huh? Did you sign confession? No. No, I wouldn't sign, so they--they tortured someone else. Forgive me. I was actor. Moving pictures. In my last picture, I played aristocrat. They arrested me when the film was released. Why? It was claimed I was elevating the status of the old nobility. So you got ten years for a performance in a film. I've had better notices. Nyet. The Urki. Do you know who these are? Professional criminals. Murderers and thieves. Don't stare at them. The guards let them run things in here, and they are to be feared. Then why would they let them run things? Because they are byproduct of bourgeois society and so friends of people. We are political prisoners and so enemies of people. The Soviet Union has become one vast prison. Slave labor. They are from far reaches of Soviet Empire, all caught up in same net. And, uh, do any of them wriggle out of the net? No, Janusz. You must be more careful. Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere, even in here. If you are not more careful, you will die after one year. If not literally, then spirit. And how long have you been in here? Eleven months and 29 days. You do for me. You want me to draw you? No. Not me. Lice? Eating me alive. For that I have old folk remedy. Come. The mine. They blast at night. What are you doing? We must be quick. Or this will not be here in the morning. You're going to leave it here overnight? Why? You'll see. It can be done. I know a way through the wire. How? Lazar, my associate, he is overseer of construction. He showed me. If you ever escape the camps, and I've been waiting so long for someone like you, someone with the strength, the will to see it through. But to go where? I mean, we can't go west. I mean, apart from the Germans, there's the Soviets. And east, all Soviet right to the Pacific. No, no, no, no. North. Have to be-- have to be south. Correct. But do you know where we are? I mean, exactly? I beileve we are about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal. This is the lake. Camp is here. And the border is here. We could follow the edge of the lake here. That runs due south. Exactly. Then we cross the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Mongolian border and freedom. Spring is already upon us. We will have to wait till autumn. No. Why wait? Why? Because it is a thousand kilometers to the border, maybe more. We need careful planning. We need to stockpile food. I've already begun trading, dealing. You must do the same. And in autumn, the weather is more predictable. We can use the new snow to cover our tracks. And we bring my friends. Your friends? You trust them? Of course. They won't all survive. But they will die free men. Free. That's a really brave man! First we need big branches! One on each side and then one on the back! Help me, Kazik. These down there, put it there on the branch. Yes, yes. Follow me. We'll both go like this. What? Good. Yes.Put it there. Zoran! Your blanket! For a wind break. Get in. Come on. Come! Please come with us! We have shelter! I am Zoran, Yugoslav. That's Janusz. And he's Kazik. Horodinsky. They are Polish. Voss. I'm Latvian. It's a League of Nations. And you are? Smith. And your first name. Mister. Mr. Smith. That's right. Might as well have shot us yesterday. We're for the mines. These collars same as used by ancient Egyptian people. Yes, but on their horses, probably. No. No, no, no. Same for people. How do you know? I was professor of Egyptology, Leningrad University. Are you crazy? They'll shoot you. I've got to get out of here. I have to get back. I have to get back. It can be done. What can be done? He knows a way through the wire. He has a plan. Shh. Who has a plan? His name is Khabarov. The actor. Do you know him? He has no intention of escaping. What do you mean? He's a liar. He's been here for years. Seeks out new arrivals. Me, when I first came here. He just likes to talk about escape. I've known others like him. Why should I believe you? Nothing is for nothing in the camps. From you he gets your energy, your spirit. You feed his dream of escape. You help keep him alive. He's nothing but a leech. You are a cold bastard, Mister. I'm still alive, that's all I know. But I won't be in another six months, and neither will you. Not here. Not in these mines. But if you are serious-- really serious about making a run for it-- I'm with you. I thought you were a loner. It can't be done alone. Besides, you have a--a weakness. You could be useful to me. And what is that? Kindness. If anything happens to me, I'm counting on you carrying me. Khabarov. Khabarov, come. What? Come with me. Now. What is it? What? What? Come. Look at this. Look at this. We can go. We can go tonight. The storm will cover our tracks. No, no, no. What are you talking about? It's a passing storm! No, it's enough. Janusz, that is impossible. We need-- We need detailed preparation, we need plans, we need maps. No, no, the timing will never be perfect. Look, they won't expect it now. Are you crazy? What about the distances, huh? It's, it's a thousand kilometers, and we need food. Plenty of food. But, but we have food. You have food. Look, the American is with us. We've been trading, just like you said. How long will that last? Look, I've spent half my life In the woods and mountains. We can live off the land. You don't understand. You are too young. It cannot be done. What else is there? You hear me? To stay here and die? It cannot be done. Andrei! How do we get through that wire? I don't know what you are talking about. Your friend Lazar-- I mean, he knows, doesn't he? You told me that. Piss off now. You can't see, can you? Please don't leave me behind. Promise me, Andrejs. I can hold onto your shoulder by night. I can--I can see shapes. By day I can see just fine. I won't hold you up. Please don't tell the others. In here, I die. Swiss. There are no secrets here. What do you want? The game goes against me. Small debt, they take fingers. Big debt, they take head. Me, big debt. But I never gambie my Wolf. In forest, you need knife, and I need miracle. Get me out of here. Come on! Come on! Look! Keep going. Keep going! We must keep going! Get up! Get up! Activity, or we die right now. You know how fast the dogs are. Run, damn you! Mister, come on, look at me. Is it time for me to carry you? Come on. Come on. Come on! Janusz, we can't see anything! The snow is blinding us! Janusz! I need your knife! Give me the knife! Your knife! Janusz, we must take shelter! We can't go on! Don't you see? This is perfect! They'll never find us like this. Never! You stare at me like snake at rabbit. He teach me English. Speak good, huh? Bread for words, wasn't it, cowboy? How far have we come? Maybe 20, 30 kilometers. That's all? Less, if we've been going in circles like chicken without head. All right, let's see what we have. Everyone, come on. We share everything. And you? What? Do you have? And that coat. It's not your coat. That is Khabarov's coat. Yes, he gave me. And. Huh? Huh? See? He was going to inform. Don't worry. I talk to him. Everything okay. You've made a bargain with the devil. You realize that? Do you have a knife? For direction he uses grass and the mosses. What's that? I swear to God he better know what he's doing. You should be grateful you're here at all. Grateful is for dogs. What-- What's that? Woives. It's only wolves. Only wolves. South. To Lake Baikal. You are the Pakhan. Am I? What is a Pakhan? Boss of Urki. We are not criminals. We are escaping from criminals. I have been watching you. And I swear to God you win my respect with your sticks and pine cones. I'll come between you and death. So you want to be my bodyguard? It's the Urka way. You have me, and you have the Wolf. Huh? Janusz, how long till we get to the lake? How long? Three, four weeks. Maybe more. I have us here somewhere. And down here, the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the border of Mongolia. Mongolia seems so far away. Mongolia? I go more. To America. It's like this-- we have food for another week. We have no more matches. But still we have Khabarov's flint. We need meat. I can make traps. We'll be moving too fast to wait for traps. We find farms, villages, get food there. Look, there's a bounty on our heads. Remember that. We steal it. At night. They never know. We are not thieves. Then I'll steal it, and I'll eat. You can watch. What is that? Barbed wire. He's making a fish-hook. That's how we will survive. With fish? Uh. But I don't eat fish. Then you'll die. Come on, we need to make a fire. Come on, lots of wood. It'll be 40 below tonight. Tomasz? No, no, not too much, not too much. Kazik? Kazik? He's still out, looking for wood. He has night blindness. Kazik! Kazik! Janusz! Janusz! Professor. I came from the mine to find you. I thought I was alone. I've been walking with you for some time. I'll-- I'll just sit for a minute. Not far to go. We made it. We really made it. Isn't that something? Lord, take this innocent soul into thy keeping. Amen. A free man died here today. Still, one less mouth to feed. What? They'll find our bones and your drawings a hundred years from now and say "Look, a fine example of Early Gulag Man." Shut up with your jokes. Go and find food like the others do. You do the shutting up! Drawing all day like you're on holiday. I'm sick. I cook. They find food. What do you ever do? Nothing. But I make you all laugh. No, not anymore, you don't. So. who will be first? What do you mean, first? The first to die. I think the artist. But better if it was him, the funny man. Why better if it's Zoran? More soft. More--tender. Mister only catch little fish now. We must have meat, or we die here. You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it. We all have. That's why you brought extra people, isn't it? For food? No, no, no. We will get more food when we get to Lake Baikal. There will be plenty of fish there. You said we would have seen lake a week ago. Huh? We're lost, Pakhan. Raah! Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! Yaah! Look, if I, uh, if I find the lake, I will be back in a week. If I don't, well, you're on your own. I know. Our friend Valka. Don't let him out of your sight. Here. Fresh this morning. Thank you. Good luck. And you. Janusz! I saw it. I saw it. I saw the Lake. Easy, easy. Three days from here. Stones! Gather stones! Heat them in the fire! What is it? Psst. Psst. Pssst. Hey. Someone's been following us. He's behind that dark clump of trees. If he gives us away, they'll be all over us in no time. He's right. We have to do this. No killing. No? I think you've killed before. You say too many prayers for an innocent man. Valka, you go behind in case he makes a run for it. Go. Spread out, spread out. Valka, no. No! We--we won't hurt you. Huh. A Polka. Polka? What does he want? I don't know. It's a girl. And she's Polish. She's been following us for several days. And what? Well, she needs food, you know, protection. She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russian. She wants to travel with us? She's on the run, like us. She'll slow us down. She said she's escaped from a Russian collective farm. I know this type-- street gypsies. There are thousands like that, less use than a dog! Pakhan, don't do this. Huh? Oh, come on. She's starving. We can barely feed ourselves. Yeah, maybe it's kinder to leave her. No, she was sent to us. We can't leave her. Janusz, we have no choice. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stay back. Stay back. Careful of the mud. Easy. Easy. Easy. Valka. Here you are. Find some wood. Her name is Irena. Is the soap ready? Yes. Ah, good. Stir. Well? What's so funny? Are you-- you are going to the office this morning? Valka? Valka. Come on. You're next. Go, go. Valka, come on! Now take off your shirt. Why do we do this? So we don't look like thieves and robbers. Head up. Now, still. Very still, please. Head up. More. Nyet. You know, I, uh, can't beiieve she's Polish. She's, uh, she's educated. Speaks good English, French. Is that right? You don't like her, do you? Speak to Valka about her. He doesn't even think she's Polish. Well, I did speak to him. And the others. They agree she comes with us. What, you disagree? There's no room for sentimentality, you know that. Apart from food, she'll slow us down. No, it won't take our weight. We'll have to swim across. Can you swim? Yes, Mister. You wouldn't lie to me. I'm not lying, Comrade. And don't call me Comrade. Irena, no! Here, come on. Here, take the food. Were your parents arrested with you? They're dead. We lived on a farm outside Warsaw. When the Russians came, they said we were kulaks and exploiting the peasants. My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn. I found them later. I-- I found them face-down in the mud. They'd been bashed and strangled with barbed wire. Later, the Russians caught me and sent me to a collective farm. They were cruel to me. I ran away. I had no food. And then I saw you. You can't swim, can you? What? You've never been near the water in your life. But I got across, didn't I? And you followed. And you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw? Yes. Soviets didn't get that far. That was German territory. Your parents weren't murdered, were they? You made all that up. We've all done terrible things to survives. But don't ever lie to me again. We've had enough of lies. We have to go around it. Quicker through it. No, they have dogs. If they raise the alarm, then we don't stand a chance. We need food again, Pakhan. Look, I know we need food, but we can't go into that town and risk arrest. We're wasting time. What is it? What's wrong? Where's Valka? He was behind Zoran. Zoran, weren't you watching him? I'm not his keeper. Damn him. He could turn us in for the bounty. And risk arrest? He's a gambler. Irena, do you think he would do that? He might. We don't need his knife. We can make one out of deer bone. It's an opportunity to get rid of him. All right, all right. Come on, let's go. Watch it funny man? Hey, hey, hey! You want to get us all killed? Hmm? Hmm? Easy, cowboy. You tear my coat. Idiot. Idlot? Ha. Am I? Let's see who is idiot. What? Did I kill? Yes. A dog. Don't believe me, then don't eat. But you will, won't you, because you want to survive. I know about survive. All my life. And-- it's my birthday. In Russia, that means we drink. She lived in the streets, like me. So the story you told us wasn't true. I thought that story would be more sad and you wouldn't leave me behind. My parents were Polish Communists. They took us to live in Soviet Union, to Moscow. They want to work for the Revolution. We lived in the Hotel Lux, with lots of foreign Communists. But they arrested them in 1937. They said they were spies. The people pot me in the orphanage. And my brother, he died. I was ten years old. They called me Rykov, but I remembered our Polish name-- Zielinska. I used to say it every night before I went to sleep. So you ran away. Oh. They have no mosquitoes. What can we do? Steal a boat? No, it's too risky. People are going to get ill. I know. Isn't it strange? After all we've faced, these tiny insects might bring us down. There it is again. No mosquitoes! Zoran! Zoran! What's he doing, for God's sake? Mosquito repellent. So what you say to him? Who? The mosquito man. Ah. I'm an escaped convict who is plagued by mosquitoes. Yeah, very funny. No, really, what did you say? Come on, man. Clown. Goodbye, Lake Baikal. Well done. Mister, did you know Voss is a priest? No, I didn't know that. And Tomasz is a pastry chef, but he wants to be an artist. You don't say. And Zoran was on business in Moscow, arrested in Red Square. He said he was just taking a photo of the Kremlin. He's an accountant. Well, I'll be damned. I never knew a funny accountant. Don't you talk to each other? In the camps you learn to say as little as possible. Mr. Smith? Working on the Moscow Metro? He's an engineer. His father was Finnish. Grew up in America, but he could speak Russian. And why would an American move to Russia, for God's sake? The Depression. His son came with him. What happened to his son? They shot him. He was 17. The Mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks-- maybe four, five days away. Can we cross somewhere else? Here, this is the main line. It's going to be like this everywhere. He's right. We wait till tonight. What? Nothing. Just looking. Don't look. Valka? What? Why do you have assholes tattooed on your chest? I mean, they should be on your ass so you can sit on them every time you take a shit. You think it's funny? They are great men. Whoa, whoa! Valka! Valka! Don't you know what "Stalin" means, funny man? Means Man-of-Steel. He takes from rich and gives to poor. Yes, of course he does. Then he takes both of them and puts them in a Gulag for 25 years. Watch your eyes, crow bait. Thank you, Mother Russia, for your hospitality, but I will definitely not be coming back. You know, they'll-- they'll catch you. Yeah. Prison is okay. Debt is bad. But there are many prisons, they don't find me. What about America? Oh. It's not for me, freedom. I wouldn't know what to do with it, I swear to God. So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me. You don't need him anymore. Good luck, Valka. Goodbye, Janusz. Look. See? Do you think we'll get there by tonight? Yes, I think so. What will we do? We will eat. Yes. We will sleep. We made it. Mister! They're communists. So it's here too. This changes everything. There's nowhere to hide. It's a Buddhist temple. They might take us in. They might also be working with the regime. It's a risk. What happened here? The same as happened in Russia. Churches closed. priests shot or taken to camps. religion banned. They came to my church, in Latvia. Destroyed everything, much like this. I went back later that night, and there was a lone-- lone guard. Just a boy. And I strangled him until his eyes popped right out of his head. Valka knew somehow. He knew I'd killed in cold blood. How far is China? I don't know. Maybe five, six hundred kilometers due south. 600 kilometers? Is Chlna free? They're fighting the Japs. I know that much. After China is Tibet. We could go to Lhasa, the capital. What? What are you talking about? They say we could go beyond Tibet, over the mountains to India. What mountains? The Himalayas. Join the British Army. Fight Nazls, then fight the Russians. Go over the Himalayas? How? On a magic carpet? How? We walk. Careful. Come on, wake up. I was in the middle of this beautiful dream. I was about to eat some salt. I almost taste it. I just want to go back to that dream. It's a very simple recipe. You just need two sprigs of rosemary and a pinch of nutmeg. Nutmeg? What about the salt? No, we'll--we'll get to that. Now-- add the oil-- Mm-hmm. And you leave it to marinate while you prepare the chicken. This is where the salt comes in. Good. You rub it into the skin of the chicken with a little bit of the paprika. But double the salt. Look, you cannot just doubie the sait. It'll be too salty then. I don't care, just doubie the sait. I'm not going to ruin it. Just double the salt, please. No. Tomasz-- No. All right, all right. Everybody keep calm. Oh, my God! No, no, no! Don't run! Don't run. Be calm and smile. Be friendly. Hey, whoa! Whoa! Everybody smile. Hello. Hello. That's south. Are we going to eat that? It's either this or fish. It looks like a bird's nest. It will protect you from the sun. Irena, try this for your feet. South. Come on, we keep going. No, it's another mirage. We have no water. There's trees there. If there's trees, there--there's water. No, I don't care. It's east. We're going south. But, Janusz, we've got to give it a try. No, no, no. We must keep going south, or you'll kill us all. Damn it! Janusz, we're dying. We're already dying. Stop. It's a mirage! It's just a mirage. Mirages don't have birds. Mirages don't have birds! It's a well! Don't fill yourselves. You'll get sick. At least we have water here. Shh. Shh. You'll wake her. Yeah, but no food. Maybe nomads will come to water their flocks. When? Next week, next month? We should stay here at least a few more days. Look, without food, we'll only get weaker. And then maybe too weak to travel. I don't know. After these last days-- I don't know if I can go through that again. It was a miracle finding this. Can we count on another? Janusz? Okay, give me your best. Ohh! Ah, ha ha! Wait, wait, wait! Go, Tomasz! Hat, please. Lower. Run! Run! Get back, get back! Take cover! Behind that dune! Irena! Get down! Don't be afraid! Irena. Irena. Sun-dried fish. Thank you. Here. Can you find our way back to the well? It was way off course. Remember? I mean, way east. There's no-- There's no features in this wasteland. I could never find it. When I helped my father in the fields during the hot summers, we used to suck on small stones like these. Made us feel less thirsty. Janusz! Sunstroke? I'm becoming a nuisance. No, no, no. Do they hurt you? No, not at all. They must be swelling because I've walked so far. Don't you think, Mister? Yes. You lie back down now. I'm gonna cover your legs up for you. Irena, we can stop for a while. No. Just suck on this. No! Please, no! No! Shh. Shh. Come on. We've got to keep going. My name is Irena Zieilnska. Shh. My name is Irena Zieilnska. Shh, shh, shh. Put me on the ground, Andrejs. Just lay me on the ground. It's okay. Command thine angels to receive her and to take her to heaven-- her country. Amen. I really like this one. When did you do that? Second night in the Gulag. Poor Kazik, always in trouble with his feet. Who is this? You. Looks like my father. Is that how I look now? No. Now, you look worse. You caught her smile. Look. This is--just a sketch. But I'll work on it. I'll do it. That's really fine work. You're a great artist, Tomasz. It's almost like a photography. It's the shadow. It's really nice. We have to get to those hills. Water may be trapped there. Come on. Come on, get up. Get up. Mister. Come on. Go on without me. I'm done. Go. Zoran. you go to the hills and look for water. And you wait for us there. No. Yes. We'll catch up. Did you find water? No. Show me. Please show me. Where--? Where are you? There's-- water! Zoran. Around here. Look at that, uh? What if--if it's poisonous? How can we eat it? No, no, no, we cut off its head. Here. Give me the knife. Ah, look at that. Tastes like chicken. Yeah. A big, black, poisonous chicken with no legs. Well, it's not bad. You know, Valka talked of eating each other when we were in Siberia. He did? Yes. And? Would you have eaten me? Yeah. Yeah, of course. I would never have eaten you. Well, why not? Too stringy and bitter. I'd rather eat snake. Here's some water. It can kill you, remember? What? Kindness. How long can you survive on mud and snakes? Just leave me here. You can't, can you? Look, Mister-- What? You know, I may not even know your first name, but i, uh-- I know your son's name. Irena told you? Yes. Can I say his name? David. Saying his name won't bring him back. What are you trying to do, give me the will to live? Is that it? Stop me from giving up? And are you giving up? In the camps, some saw death as freedom. Then why didn't you just kill yourseif? Survival was a kind of protest. Being alive was my punishment. Punishment for what? I brought David to Russia. And now no one can forgive you. And you can't forgive yourself. Irena told me. that they tortured your wife. and she informed on you. Yes. They did the same thing to my boy. Then they shot him in the head. My wife is alive. She lived-- and was released. That much I know. But she'll never be able to forgive herseif for what she's done. You see, only I can do that. She will be torturing herself, just like you. So you see, I have to get back. I-have-to-get-back. Janusz. Pack your things, quick. Janusz! Do you hear that? What is that? Tibet. Lhasa. And where is India? Mmmm. India. India. Yes. There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains. Many people go there. Are there villages on the way? Small villages, yes. They give you food. Fuel for fire. But you can't go now. Why? If big snow comes, very difficult. You wait until spring. This family keep you. Well, we can't cross the mountains in winter. He said it was difficult but not impossible. Janusz, it's only three months. Look, we can't let go. What do you mean? If we stop now, then we'll give In to exhaustion. No, it's not giving in. We are exhausted. I will sleep till spring like a bear in a cave. You can study Buddhism and become a monk. But first you must learn how to like their tea. I already like the tea. Good night. What about you, Mister? What are you going to do for three or four months? I'm going to Lhasa. Our friend has a contact. He thinks he can get me out through China. There's a U.S. military mission there. Looking out for number one. Isn't that what you Americans say? Zoran-- Zoran. What? We escaped. We made it. You're right. He's right. Apart from a few mountains, we are there. We made it. Not all of us. No, not all of us. What are you going to do, Mister? When you go back home. Home? Build Metros? Might drift a while. I will fight. First Germans, then Russians. And then? Re-build your church? No. I will die fighting. I'm going to get Tomasz' pictures to a newspaper or get them published somehow. And then I'm going to cook his chicken but with extra salt, just--just to annoy him. And you, Janusz? As long as the communists are in Poland, you cannot go back. They'll shoot you, Janusz. I'll just, uh--keep going, you know, until it's over. I'll just keep walking. He's gone. Janusz! Janusz! Namaste. Namaste. Welcome to India. Paper passport, please. Passport. We--we--we don't have. Never mind. Come with me. Where have you come from? Siberia. Siberia? And how did you come, sir? We walked. Walked?

Spring 1 794 Year 11 of the Republic A good revolutionary must be hardy - Article One -''All men are born free and equal ''Social distinctions. ''.can only be founded. ''.on common interest - The principle . - The goal. ''The goal of all political associations is the good of the nation ''Liberty is the right to do anything. -.not harmful to. - Your fellow men Why is there still no bread? They're blaming the war The bread shortage has nothing to do with the war. lt's a ploy. By whom? Those who want to discredit the government and make the people revolt - Or it's the government - To what end? Power corrupts, it's an old story You speak for Robespierre? They're starting early this morning - Who's that? - An emigre, caught on his way out He's so handsome You make them walk there now? - The walk back won't be so easy - Not with your head under your arm Give me your card - Why? What have l done? - Your card But l've done nothing wrong - will you cut off my head? Look! lt's him! lt's Danton ''The despot says: let many innocents die rather than have one culprit escape ''The Public Safety Committee sees despotism as a necessary measure ''They agree with Machiavelli that the greater good excuses minor evils. ''.that liberty, like a child, needs tears and pain to reach maturity ''ln fact, the mere desire for liberty is enough to make one free ''The people won their right to freedom the day they claimed it: 1 4th July ''The final safeguard against despotism is a free press ''lf Moscow had a free press it would be a republic tomorrow - ''lf it's destroyed in France.'' - Be quiet - Has it been distributed? - No, it's still at the printer's What are you waiting for? Citizen barbers, come in Greetings and fraternity! What a fine day! Spring is here at last You don't look too well Well, you've been ill for five weeks We'll soon fix that Hairpins. Tomorrow l'll trim your hair What are you doing? Hiron, you have no right You should arrest Camille Desmoulins He's right, he's just a printer Sorry, we have no orders to arrest you, Citizen Desmoulins No, l'd rather not look Come back tomorrow, as usual You're better How fortunate Danton is back He's plotting a coup - Have you read it? - Not yet Desmoulins urges the people to rise against the Committees All of Paris is talking about a coup d'etat and a dictatorship Who's the man? No name's been mentioned yet, but l think it's. Danton! Has he gone mad? The Republic will be spared much grief if we send Danton to the guillotine now Danton is an idol He's not really dangerous lf it isn't him. it's Desmoulins Real bread, citizen? - Yes, but there's no sugar - Never mind - There's no sugar - Thank you, l haven't slept l'm exhausted Danton is behind those attacks, Camille Desmoulins is in thrall to him - What is our true goal, Antoine? - The triumph of the Revolution But not at any price; why all this carnage? There are easier ways Such as? Desmoulins and Danton will be beheaded whatever you say ls it really so cold? Can l have my coat, please? ls your fever up? lt'll pass Don't you dare stare at him ''Committees Equal Dictatorship'' The attacks against the government are growing too frequent Desmoulins' newspaper calls for war on the Committees - l accuse Danton and his friends. - Forgive me, l'm a little late Just like school l accuse Danton and his friends of counter-revolutionary activity Would you deprive the Revolution of its best servants? You can't be serious You surprise me, Robespierre - Danton, a servant of the Revolution? - You're raving No, Billaud, l remember even if you don't You forget all that Danton has done in your eagerness to cut him down Citizens. lt was he who got the ball rolling by setting up our revolutionary cell in 1 790 and 1 791 - remember that! Remember the Champ de Mars massacre? Danton instigated it Then fled to the country Let's stop all this The letter found in Mirabeau's safe openly denounced Danton's plotting Can we trust a traitor's word? Lawyers' tricks ln any case, we cannot base such a serious charge on rumours alone l insist we call citizen Amar Amar of the Security Committee ln no case can l allow Danton to go on trial Robespierre, you're afraid l know it's easier to execute him, but l say that his good faith is beyond question Killing this defenceless man is barbaric and senseless - Defenceless - Quite! His only weapon was that newspaper Was? l had the paper closed down Desmoulins will replace it with another - Then we shall. - Eliminate Camille! No, we'll win him over Camille's our most fervent propagandist Citizen Amar. You have evidence against Danton Go on! Read it! Are you praying? What l'm about to say must remain confidential Citzens, like all of you, l doubt Danton's good faith At last! And yet. Yet l object categorically to his execution Justice is a divine virtue, hence unattainable The Revolutionary Tribunal cannot embody justice lt can only be a tool to punish the nation's enemies But it cannot clamp down on criminals Fabre, Danton and the rest are guilty of numerous crimes The axe will fall on Fabre who undermines the Revolution But we won't touch Danton who bears the most blame Executing Danton would only plunge the bourgeoisie into counter-revolution The Convention would rise against us We'd shake the people's faith in the Revolution And in that case we'd have to rule by terror alone You know what that means? Terror is despair, nothing else Yes, l'm afraid So afraid of terror that to avoid it l'll make any compromise, stoop to the basest humiliation any lie The traitor, Danton, must be granted an exorbitant favour: amnesty For the good of the country, we must submit We can't afford to be just You're here, at last! - So you're back - Yes, l was bored - l've come for my orders - What orders? Here's what l say: first, free all the prisoners l'll summon our fighting men, raid the Convention and kill the leaders Splendid! l wish you luck But you don't understand, Robespierre's on the move The Committee is about to pounce on us, and you, after what you've done Why me? What have l done? Not much, but if the Supreme Judge is mentioned and your name comes up - Easily done ''Danton is after a dictatorship!'' One single whisper, and you've had it Who'd dare condemn me? The Committee, of course - Robespierre's on his feet again - Oh, that puny Committee You're so sure of yourself Use your head, Westermann, l have all of Paris behind me lt's now or never, believe me lt's a wonder you're still free lt's not a miracle, it's because you're my friend They cannot arrest my friends l have one thing Robespierre lacks: my newspaper lt makes me far more powerful than that powdered charlatan Does that reassure you? The paper's been seized, the printer arrested Very reassuring! We've had it Can't you say hello, Camille? And you, Lucille, how are you? Maybe we've gone too far lf you're scared, run to Robespierre, tell him l forced you to write Stop it, l did what l had to do! l urged the people to end the terror Now it's your turn to make a move, otherwise my action was pointless - We must act at once - Why? - The printer - l know - Don't you care for your life? - Of course What about yours? - We must strike - You talk like a butcher This is politics. Come, use your heads So Camille's humiliated Robespierre To salvage his prestige he arrests the printer and seizes the paper lt's a provocation He just wants us to show our hand. So we do nothing, we stay calm Understand? Calm - Philippeaux wants you - Who's he? Liberal? Moderate? A spotless record, he's perfect for us - You're for attacking the Committee? - Not yet l'm also thinking it over - l'd like to know what you're after - So would l - Would you end the terror? - Would you topple the government? l'd join you if l trusted your motives Don't you believe me? Why? You formed the Revolutionary Tribunal and voted to execute the king So did you This leads nowhere Did l ask for your help? Georges, Phillippeaux and his kind want to support you Reassure them you won't abuse your power - l don't want power - You say that now No, l don't want power. l'm 35 and l look 60, l'm tired l'd like to retire But first l must end the terror, because l'm partly to blame for it Fine words, but we know you too well You're rich enough to give up politics Take care, Philippeaux! lt's you who asked to talk to me Calm down, Georges All right, I'm listening, but make it short, what do you want? Disarm the Public Safety Committee, it has outlived its usefulness Do it without causing an upheaval. Only you can do it Frankly, you disgust me, but l've decided to back you Thank you, l'm flattered. How will you do it? With armed men, if need be - Are you worried? - Yes, everyone is - You really want to move? - Strike now. l told you lnsurrection is a terrible, uncontrollable force. no! Robespierre has one weakness: his secret police, loathed by everyone Bourdon, in the Convention today, attack a top secret agent - Hiron? - Yes, for example Accuse him, mention informers, searches - the nation will support you lt'll say this is its last hope for freedom, and we are that last hope - ls that enough? - Yes, they'll calm down So will Robespierre. Go on Georges is right Always heed your wife, it'll be the start of a new era Then back to our modest, quiet lives Yours will be quiet and ours modest lf you see poverty as a revolutionary virtue, join Robespierre And you change printers What can be more destructive, more anti-Republican than this invisible police, with its numerous informers that infiltrates everywhere, spreading lies and threats? This police which endangers individual liberty which foments mistrust between fathers and sons and sees itself as above the law? This police is headed by an ex-criminal named Hiron who, under the guise of. Who, under the guise of public service, settles private scores and openly favours the rogues he recruits He seems in a rush, where's he going? The Committee, of course, got up as soon as Hiron was mentioned The Convention voted to arrest Hiron Our best man? Lose him and we lose control of Paris So much for your defenceless Danton l want to see him today See that traitor? Set up the meeting This session is over You'd lower yourself to ask Danton to receive you? When it comes to the good of the nation, l'd stoop to anything l've just spoken to the Committee Secretary Some members are accusing you of high treason - Just me? - The others too, all of them Robespierre agrees? - l don't know yet. l'm going - Afraid? l'd rather not be seen with you No, change all that, please Only blue flowers, he only likes blue New style turbot, formerly ''maitre d'hotel'' We'll start with stuffed cucumber Then vol-au-vents Vol-au-vents in ''Convention sauce'' Formerly known as caper sauce Quails ''emigre'' style with onions And to finish, fruit in Varennes sauce - ls it to your satisfaction? - Perfectly, thank you l'd have made him wait, dressed carelessly, anything. but not this - lt's a gesture, it's now or never - Just leave me alone! Go home Let me see him humiliated, please Go home! You too, Bourdon No! Certainly not! - l must know how to vote - l said go home! Everybody out Now that's blue, exactly Get rid of all these people, quick - l must be alone Right away Clear out, all of you Sorry, security Good evening. l kept you waiting, l'm sorry No matter, for once we're alone together Just you and me - ls everything all right, citizens? - Fine, thank you - Would you like some? - No, thank you And this? - Magnificent, isn't it? - No, thank you - A quail, perhaps? - No, thank you lt's not poisoned. Look Delicious! No? Sit down - You're really not hungry? - No, thank you What do you want? To talk frankly with you Haven't you always? Why did you attack Hiron? Why did you arrest Dessenne and ban the paper? l must protect the government, but l don't understand you They say that you are plotting lt's not true, you know l'm as pure as snow Your many enemies want you dead You too? Stop attacking me and l give you my word you'll have nothing to fear Because l do now? l thought you didn't drink? To our understanding What do you want? l like your directness State publicly that you're joining us - l can't - Why? Because l don't approve of the government, l have that right But not to proclaim it. Especially not you You expect me to bow down to them? You think you're above the government? The individual is above the masses We both despise the Committees, but l say so They mustn't come between us Not the Committee, not the government - nobody Divided, we both fall lf you continue your reign of terror l cannot support you, no one will The people, our strength, will destroy the Revolution Who's to blame? Not l, and certainly not you. So it must be the nature of things l've never believed in the nature of things Nor l ln fact, our convictions are the same Not any more We fought a revolution in the name of righteousness and equality Now you chop off any head that stands out - was that our goal? l defend the people where no one did Against whom? Men who grow rich from the Revolution Yes or no? You want men to act like the heroes in novels You forget we're made of flesh and blood You want to raise us to heights where we can't breathe And so you isolate the Revolution, you freeze it Even the most fervent recoil Your advice? Come back to our level, right away Stop the revolutionary impetus and you kill the Revolution People want to eat and sleep in peace Without bread there's no law, freedom, justice - no Republic To hell with the Committees l admire you l'd love to follow you, but not just anywhere I just want to provide normal living conditions for 80% of the people Come now, l know you We're not at the Tribunal That's not all you want Men shouldn't stay in power too long You dream of power? l don't have to, l've got it The only real power: from the man in the street l understand him and he understands me, never forget that l shan't, but don't forget that l'll stop at nothing to ensure his happiness You want his happiness You know nothing of the people How could you? Look at yourself! You don't drink, you're powdered Swords make you faint, and they say you've never had a woman For whom do you speak? You want to make men happy but you're no man l'll show you the people Let's take a walk through the streets Forgive me l've always been brutal and clumsy l woke up last night thinking: how could we two have been driven apart? How could we two be taken for enemies? lt makes no sense We must stop it at once Then do as l ask What's that? l'm asking you to join us l went to the country to think things over, and l'll tell you something Frankly, quite frankly. l'd rather be executed than executioner You're drunk lf you insist. You see this head? Do you see it? Feel it? lt's you who'll have to cut it off l'm sorry, we both made a mistake Good night l have witnesses who heard everything That's why l said nothing - Where did he go? - What happened? Now l've got him I've got him! So, l got it wrong? Now you see, we must put an end to the Committees You were wrong about Robespierre Come now! Quickly! - They're waiting - There's no point Your plan is childish lt 's now or never! - Come with me - No! No more bloodshed - that's what l'm fighting for That's what l'm fighting for You say that to me? Yes, to you You'd see your friends' blood flow? - lt's good to see you - How's your mother? Worse than ever This is Sophie. from Nantes Go to your meeting l can't come tonight Are you coming? What happened? Why are you silent? - Tell me! - lt's war - Danton forced the issue - What? Robespierre is due for a lesson Tell me what happened, everything they said l don't know, l couldn't hear very well That's what l've been dreading For three months l've had these forebodings ls your husband in? - l'm glad you came - Why? You've changed a lot l don't know. you're like a stranger now l've aged, if that's what you mean That's not it, but. Maxime, is he really in danger? Yes, he is You're my only hope Tell me, why did you reject him, why did you abandon him? lt was the other way round Really? Then l misunderstood How could you? Camille was your friend That's why l came l said l was out We must talk, it's serious Why bother? Listen! You're in grave danger. l came to warn you You don't realise, your life's at stake Your friend Danton is using you He's exploiting your talent, unscrupulously He's only interested in personal ambition That's not real friendship, it's a dubious alliance Enough! You don't frighten me He who fights for freedom does not fear the ultimate price: death By advocating charity and tolerance you believed you were saving our country, did you not? But in fact you're aiding subversion, which is precisely Danton's goal You must understand So what should l do now? Address the Convention tomorrow Take back all your attacks Then, in the next issue of your paper retract what you said in previous issues You're demeaning yourself like a slut Danton threw you out, so you come and crawl to me You're terrified Remember, Maxime. Burning a newspaper is no answer This is your last chance, listen to me or you're finished You must believe me l swear it's true, Camille Get out What happened? You must tell me What was the point of this meeting? Danton and Robespierre have been at odds all this time They won't change now He's not here yet? Good No, but you're ten minutes late What joy, you remind me of my youth Forgive me for being so late Spoken like a king to his ministers Then how should l speak? ln one hour, at 3.30 a.m. you'll send the police to arrest Danton Tonight? So soon? lt's madness! Out of the question, citizen Danton and his accomplices too Without preparing the people? lt's political suicide We'd expose ourselves to certain defeat l say the Committee must first prepare public opinion Let me have my say Danton has the bankers' support, you yourself told us that lt will be the Committee's death and Danton's triumph You're right, Danton has support everywhere lt won't work l wish to speak Not about that We must strike swiftly Give him three days and he'll get gold from the bankers He'll raise an army and scatter leaflets all over Paris He won't hesitate to address the Convention You all know he's a great orator We must do it tonight, or never You're right lf it upsets the Convention, l shall intervene personally We need an indictment Who'll write it? lt's done Read it l'd like to read it over again first Citizens, we need the approval of the Public Safety Committee No argument! Call them in - Are they still here? - Yes, the session's just ending Ask them to come in What changed your mind? Who else besides Danton? Here's my list: Lacroix, Philippeaux. Totally innocent Their intentions may be, we're judging the facts Legendre, Bourdon. lnnocent puppets, let's avoid a bloodbath, please The first humane words of the night All right, let's spare them Desmoulins? Desmoulins is my friend but l shall abide by your decision Perhaps we should give him an extra day to think it over lmpossible Very well, those three will be jailed with Danton We've just signed Westermann's arrest - He was recruiting fighting men - Perfect timing The Committee's just decided to arrest Danton and three accomplices - Who? - Georges Danton - You want him arrested? When? - Tonight! You're all mad We need your approval - lf we refuse? - You're the secret police You can make preventative arrests That's our privilege, not yours You can delegate to us - That's illegal - Not if you agree to it - Who the devil. - Calm, Vadier - Do you know what you're doing? - lt's a heavy responsibility We are prepared to accept that responsibility, entirely Write! ''We, of the Public Safety Committee. ''.and of the Security Committee. ''.have unanimously agreed. ''.that Danton.'' Who else? Lacroix Philippeaux Desmoulins Desmoulins? ''These four members of the National Convention. ''.are under arrest. ''.and are to be imprisoned in. ''.Luxembourg Prison'' Sign it Your signatures, please Lindet, you didn't sign l was elected to bring revolutionaries to life not to kill them The session is over l always said you were a great man. l was ready to die for you l take it all back, all of it! l was as blind as a bat. Now my eyes have been opened What are you talking about? What are you trying to tell me? Robespierre came to see you How do you know? Don't talk about him, you have no right - l hope you heeded his advice - No, l rejected it Poor Camille, you realise we're doomed yet you reject your salvation Why doomed? lt means the decree's been signed - What decree? - Our arrest You're the only man alive that monster still holds dear He tried to save you. lt's over What are they afraid of? They could stomach your insults But to condemn them in writing - that was unforgivable And you? l rejected a handshake and signed my own death warrant - You don't mean that - l do Why refuse? His hand's too bloody Fight back! The people are with you Can we complete the jury list? Renaudin Royer Collard - Sigur - Cross him off Sourboul Can we depend on him? Cross him off Vinot No, Vinot's out, is that all? No one else you're sure of? That's enough No, we only have seven jurors - What of it? - We need twelve, by law - Haven't you got twelve? - Only seven lf you haven't got twelve, seven will do Add a few criminals to the accused list and include Chabot, Fabre and Basire - The charge? - Anti-patriotic activity Do you know them? Round them up That's all The Public Safety Committee has just come out of session Lindet sent me to warn you Run! What do you want? There's money in the safe Take it Just make sure our wretched Republic doesn't confiscate it l'm coming Citizen Danton, you are under arrest. l have the warrant ''By order of the Security Council you are arrested and taken. I know, I know! - ls it still raining? - No Then l won't need a coat Let's go then Citizens. Danton has been arrested Danton was arrested last night The terror strikes again We must act We could be arrested any minute - Bourdon, you take the stand - l can't, l won't know what to say lt's our last chance You're scared? Look, he's shaking You go l'm a poor speaker - Legendre, you go - Go on l'll put down my name l wish to speak The session is open Speak We've just learned. We've heard, to our amazement that four deputies of the Convention were arrested last night Danton is among them Long live Danton! I demand. l demand that they be heard in this house You may then judge for yourselves whether personal enmity or jealousy are the root causes behind this outrageous decision Put down Citizen Robespierre's name - Whose turn is it? - Yours You have no right to speak lt has been quite a while since our debates were fired with such passion The issue is of great importance, and the argument is this Do we place certain individuals above the Republic? Legendre demands that the accused be allowed to take the stand - We all do - Let's hear Danton's side So you are willing to grant this man what you have refused all others On what grounds? Does Legendre maintain that Danton is a privileged citizen who may be placed above the law? He deserves some consideration So say we all. Let's hear Danton! The Republic was built by the people as a whole Who among us would dare say: ''l and l alone had the right''? No one merits the right to claim privilege For us, the privileged do not exist A defendant's right to be heard is not privilege, it is simply justice Justice? Have you lost faith in the Revolutionary Tribunal? The Tribunal is beyond reproach, we all trust in it We shall see whether the Convention stands firm and brings Danton to justice or whether it contests St Just's report - We challenge the indictment - No, you've done well Do those who shout ''Long live Danton!'' believe that he deserves a special justice? lf so abolish the Public Safety Committee and try us instead - We find no fault with the Committee - Long live the Committee! Every day the world is watching us We must show no weakness, nor moral cowardice What would become of France if we lost the trust of the French? l wish to have beside me upright and just men For innocence, that primordial virtue should not and cannot fear public scrutiny l propose that Legendre's motion be rejected Then St Just will read the indictment Who is for Robespierre's motion? Who is opposed? You're mad. lf Danton fails we all do Fools! You'll all be massacred Such statements make you guilty in my eyes After deliberation, the Convention has reaffirmed its faith in the Committee Only the guilty tremble This crime will bring you crashing down, Robespierre Of course, there we have the most common of arguments Well, what of it? Assuming there is some such obscure law of providence lf a criminal's fall must bring me down with him, then what of it? There is no instance when personal danger outweighs duty for the revolutionary l never said Danton was above the law l never doubted you l wish to speak. Silence l wish to speak For a long time l was misled by Danton's duplicity But today l at last see my mistake We should show our trust in the Committee Let us approve the indictment without hearing St Just's report Stop snivelling or l'll ask for another cell Don't leave me alone, l'll go mad Shame on you - l don't know what's happening - You're going to die in five days Better to know it and give up hope When death is certain, suffering suddenly comes to an end We may win No, it's a political trial Politics has nothing to do with justice l don't want to die, l have a right to live Man has rights as long as he can hold on to them lt's Georges l was afraid you wouldn't be here You there! Let's have wine for the representatives of the people You're crying? Then you understood nothing - Understood what? - That we had to let them do it - Why? - To open the people's eyes To show what the Committees are capable of There was no other way That's why l let it happen Are we to drink from the bottle? They haven't even got glasses Not bad The Convention approved the charges The cowards We're to go to the Conciergerie - We're doomed - Why doomed? We still have our heads, fists, teeth and claws to fight with A political trial is a duel They'll accuse us, we'll accuse them, and let the people be the judge We'll sow doubt in the minds of the people - They'll execute us without trial - No, l have a voice - The people follow me when l talk - The people can be fickle We demand witnesses. lf they refuse we don't talk lf they agree, we can win You have a visitor Who? My wife? What is it? Follow me Robespierre's waiting for you Go, he'll save you - Go on - No one's stopping you, Camille Go We'll all die, but you needn't die with us What shall l do? Go to him, he's come only for you Go on Tell the gentleman l don't want to see him l can't tell him that Then say. Camille is not at home People of France What have l in common with this scum? Who dared put these thieves next to me? Are we, spearhead of the Revolution, to be tried as petty criminals? You don't hold the floor yet, Danton Keep the journalists out, taking notes has been banned l can't take notes? Has the Committee gone mad? l write for the Rheims Standard Down with the Committees! Chabot, Delaunay, Basire, Fabre You are accused of conspiring to bribe elected delegates and foster a revolt of the nobility with gold stolen from the East lndia Company by your crooked financial schemes Desmoulins, Philippeaux, Danton are also guilty of the crimes l have just described An indictment? You call this tissue of lies an indictment? Shall l sully my mouth replying? The accused won't reply? No matter - Let him talk - Answer, Danton! Have you anything to add? Add what? We haven't spoken yet Has the jury heard enough? You're in a hurry, Fouquier l'm not finished lf you hope to address the people just remember, the law forbids it l founded the Tribunal, so l ought to know the rules Very well You may speak For the last time Yes, for the last time - the last time France. You may not address the people Five years l've led you, my name is stamped on each page of your history - True or false? - True! You're accused of corruption, you sold yourself l sold myself? There is no price for a man like me l'll have to adjourn Don't expect a revolutionary to argue coolly, l'll take all day if need be l will shout and l will be heard The law forbids you from addressing the public.

This is another of your tricks Trying us with infamous criminals so people take us for thieves like them Congratulations! An excellent idea, too bad l saw through it What is this parody of justice? Where are our witnesses? We are entitled to witnesses People of France, you are the Tribunal Bring in our accusers, the two Committees No, you haven't the right Let it all be public and you decide Panis, run to the Convention Say we want the Committee Say we're being muzzled. Run! Count on me Down with the Committees Justice? lt's a massacre - What are you doing here? - You let him go on and on Shut him up You think it's easy, so easy We expect you to be more forceful - More what? Forceful? - That's right, more forceful Come on into the court and see for yourself We know what's been going on there - We know what you said - Or rather didn't say So you're spying on me? Well done Your diffidence worries us What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You understand nothing - nothing! We'll let them have their witnesses - We can't refuse them - Out of the question Then l can't answer for the consequences. Do as you wish Are you sure we can't bar their witnesses? No, not right away But the trial is in your hands The trial is in my hands? Fine, get out then Go on, get out Since it's entirely in my hands ls the trial going so badly? - Why do you ask? - l've never seen you like this Please leave me alone Not until you've told me The Danton trial is a dilemma lf we lose the trial, the Revolution is lost lf we win, it is also lost But l ought not say so Are they out to destroy you? No. at least, not openly Please, eat before you go - No, that's pointless - Just sheaves, then There'll be lots of fruit and carts of olives from Avignon We'll depict peace, happiness and serenity The Supreme Being Try this Simple and rustic No, it's like a martyr's palm We're in trouble, the trial is going badly, Robespierre Danton's so sure of his public he's attacking the government We want Danton's death, it's up to you to justify the verdict He must not be allowed to speak out The people will rip our guts out, and another thing. The accused demand witnesses - Yesterday we sent a letter. - l know Where is it? Did you send it or not? The Convention will answer it after l tell them what l think of it We can't wait ln any case, the answer will be no Barhre, do you approve of this too? You can't do that Fouquier, if we retreat we're all lost l am a judge, l'm not your. Your private executioner You're an executioner! Not mine, no. The people's executioner, you serve justice We send you the Republic's enemies Your duty is not to judge them but to eliminate them The law is no longer with you When the wellbeing of the Republic is at stake, the law is totally behind us One more thing - lt'll be you next - We'll see about that We'll see Still working on the Pledge scene? What's Fabre doing there? - Come now, Maxime - l swear he wasn't on the list l say he wasn't there Besides, he's a traitor, remove him Are you a close friend of Danton? l insist on being identified, obey the law A pointless formality Like this entire trial Danton, you've already testified, be quiet l've hardly begun, this trial will not be over until l've had my say People of France! l, Danton, appeal to you! You alone have the right to judge me Why are the witnesses being delayed? l want them here l demand that the two Committees be tried by public opinion After we have both spoken, you, the people, will decide whether the guilty party is me or the all-powerful Committee Stop addressing the public l am accused of conspiracy l admit to it l am guilty of having conspired Deep in my heart l have conspired, but only with myself l conspired for peace, for amnesty respect for law and public order l conspired for happiness and justice These errors, since they are deemed to be such, l admit to them. ln fact l proclaim them l admit to them, but only them Another of my faults is being popular and strong when only anonymity and pettiness can guarantee a long life lf you wish to survive, do not be loved That's one of our newly invented laws One of those laws that is all the more powerful for being unwritten Woe to the strong who are loved by the people Long live the mediocre, the taciturn the bitter, who skulk in offices The Revolution is like Saturn, it devours its own children What forces us. What fate compels us to condemn rather than forgive? To kill instead of save life? What brought forth this bloodbath and where will it end, if it ever will end? l thought l could calm the storm of the Revolution I believed it was desirable, I still do But in your cold eyes l can already read of my inevitable death to which you condemned me before entering this room l wonder: was l wrong? Some men disagree with me Their thirst for ideals knows no bounds They no longer see people around them They see only speculators, villains, traitors Dazzled by the Revolutionary ideals they have forgotten the Revolution itself Their dictatorship is more ferocious than its precursor Fearing the return of tyrants, they have become tyrants Fouquier, you said the people wanted blood Liar! lt's a lie! lt's not the people who want blood, it's you The people want only to live in peace Don't saddle them with your thirst for blood You've betrayed yourself, Danton - betrayed! Only a conspirator, an enemy of the government, could thus insult the People's Tribunal The people have only one dangerous enemy The government Don't stop the trial! Set Danton free! Call the guards Soldiers, look! Seven scars on my chest Shoot me in the back People of France! Do not abandon your defenders They kill your freedom before your eyes and you let it happen Danton, come here So you've been arrested too So there is justice The Tribunal's creator condemned to death! I'll die, but so will you How can you bury the living in a hole like this? Where is he? Here You have his confession? l never said this l did it only to avoid disaster What disaster? Sign the statement Sign it - But it wasn't a plot - Then what was it? Just this Desmoulins' wife thought it would help if Danton's friends got together Such a list amounts to a plot, doesn't it? lt wasn't a plot You will sign this statement unless you wish to die We have unveiled a plot, all Paris is involved, thousands of people What plot? Organised by Desmoulins' wife and Danton's friends Many took part, a great many They were planning to blockade the courtroom tomorrow We're done for Well, Robespierre, this trial was your mad idea What now, Maximilien Robespierre? What do you want? What do you want? - What do you want? - You ask us? We've won against Danton Open your eyes, citizens Your necks are safe, you've been spared the blade Listen, any plot poses a threat to the safety of the Convention ln that case it must submit to the Committee's decision We must move fast to get this decree passed What decree? The Convention must bar Danton from speaking at the trial You must warn the Convention about the plot l can't, l have no strength left l'll go and get it then Danton insists on calling witnesses but that is out of the question You know we're innocent but it doesn't matter to you lt doesn't matter because you're just following orders But you, Fouquier, you know well what those orders are, admit it So l too am to have the honour of tasting the kiss of steel But mark my words, Fouquier you may cut off my head but the man who issued these orders will soon be rotting beside me He knows that if he kills me he will die too You want to murder me without leaving any trace You won't let reporters take notes The clerks are sitting idle with their arms folded They too have been given orders to write nothing Am l to vanish into thin air? No! l will not! l shall talk and continue talking to the end, because l am immortal l am immortal because l am the people, the people are with me And you murderers, you will be judged by the people l'm talking now and l'll go on talking Perhaps the air in this room will carry the echo of my voice, which you muffle Delegates of the Nation Here is the Convention's latest decree The Convention has voted the following decree The Tribunal will conduct the trial without interruption Any accused disrupting the course of justice will be barred from the proceedings We have unearthed a conspiracy to set free the accused and bring down the Republic The Desmoulins woman is in the streets inciting the people Beware! This room harbours agents of subversion lt's a lie! They want Lucille's death lf you oppose justice you'll be barred l ask you: have we ever opposed the Tribunal? - Have we ever abused it? - Never! Yes, you did - Well said, Georges - Thank God it's over Glorious Tribunal nest of thieves, blackmailers and pimps l have one thing to say to you: you're not fit to spit at ln obedience to the decree l bar from this court the accused, Danton Take him away Murderers! You won't silence us, Fouquier The accused, Lacroix barred Allow me to bar myself Me too, it might as well have started this way Now go to the devil Are you convinced that the accused took an active part in the conspiracy? Do you find Fabre, Chabot, Delauney, Basire and their accomplices guilty of participation in a plot to corrupt the nation's representatives in order to discredit and destroy the government? We do We will proceed to announce the sentence Lacroix, Danton, Herault, Philippeaux, Westermann Desmoulins, Fabre, Chabot, Delauney, Basire and their accomplices are condemned to death Their goods are confiscated for the benefit of the Republic Execution is to take place in Paris within 24 hours and notice posted throughout the Republic Without me it will all collapse, there'll be nothing but terror What shame on the Revolution - Hiding your fear? - No, l'm hiding nothing l'm scared too. l thought l could look death in the eye, but l can't lt will all collapse in three months at the most Three months, no more No, wait l don't feel well You're about to enter history and you feel unwell?

Worldwide.</i> <i>BRENNAN: I remember his face.</i> <i>Staring out the window.</i> <i>Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.</i> Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, <i>the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.</i> <i>They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.</i> <i>So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?</i> <i>I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.</i> <i>Fish and chips, please.</i> <i>And in a moment.</i> <i>Well, it's too late now. It's done.</i> <i>I've called his people.</i> You? <i>Beans, peas and lamb, please.</i> <i>And made an offer.</i> Now, if the subject were to say yes, <i>well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.</i> <i>So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend</i> <i>and the finest producer I know by my side.</i> So who is it? <i>Richard Nixon.</i> (LAUGHS) Richard Nixon? <i>Well, come on, don't look like that.</i> Well, how would you expect me to look? <i>I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.</i> <i>Weren't they terrific?</i> <i>Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.</i> So, okay, so what kind of interview? <i>A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.</i> And? <i>And what?

Ford,</i> <i>President of the United States,</i> <i>have granted, and by these presents do grant,</i> <i>a full, free and absolute pardon</i> <i>unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.</i> It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony <i>in American political history would never stand trial.</i> <i>It was like he slipped out the back door.</i> <i>A public opinion poll indicates</i> <i>a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.</i> <i>CHANCELLOR: One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,</i> <i>"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal."</i> <i>There was no deal, period.</i> <i>I don't think the truth will ever come out.</i> <i>The American people need to know the truth,</i> <i>and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.</i> GANNON: So how do we want to address the college protests?

English talk show guy.</i> Why would I want to talk to David Frost? <i>Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.</i> <i>No.</i> <i>Well, we didn't get back to him.</i> <i>Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.</i> <i>Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.</i> <i>We are. I just figured doing it with Frost</i> <i>would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.</i> <i>It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.</i> <i>True, true. Could probably get more money.</i> <i>Really? Look.</i> <i>We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.</i> But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, <i>it might be a shame to pass.</i> <i>It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.</i> <i>We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.</i> <i>We buried him alive, and he walked free.</i> <i>Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water</i> <i>to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.</i> <i>Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.</i> <i>My name is David Frost.</i> <i>DIRECTOR: Okay, that is a cut.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.</i> To assess that, you might call them <i>late at night or at the weekend.</i> <i>If they take the call, you know they're desperate.</i> <i>And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.</i> (PHONE RINGING) Hello? <i>Mr. Frost?

Of course.</i> <i>But I don't. I just hear a man doing it</i> because it would create headlines <i>or give him a place at the top table.</i> <i>And that is what makes me nervous.</i> <i>And you do nervous so beautifully, John.</i> <i>"Hello, good evening and welcome."</i> (FROST LAUGHS) <i>I don't actually say that.</i> <i>Hello, Mr. Frost.</i> Champagne? <i>CAROLINE: No, thank you.</i> FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Another glass, sir? <i>You don't like champagne?</i> <i>Not on airplanes.</i> <i>Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.</i> <i>The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.</i> <i>Like the Viennese serve coffee.</i> <i>Well, I've never been to Vienna.</i> <i>Oh.

Mmm-hmm.</i> <i>And that you fly around a great deal.</i> <i>Well, that's true.</i> Why? <i>I like to keep busy.</i> Why? <i>I find it more interesting than keeping still.</i> <i>You know, you have very sad eyes.</i> <i>Do I? Mmm.</i> Has anyone told you that before? <i>No.</i> Are you a sad person? <i>Let's talk about you a little bit.</i> <i>Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.</i> How right you are! <i>This is your captain speaking.</i> <i>You may have noticed we've begun</i> <i>our final descent into Los Angeles.</i> <i>If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts,</i> <i>we'll be landing very shortly.

In some dark underground cave licking his wounds? <i>Actually, no. In his rather smart beachside villa</i> <i>in California.</i> Really? Richard Nixon in a beachside villa? <i>How incongruous.</i> <i>You can come if you'd like.</i> To meet Nixon? Why not? Are you sure? <i>You know, I would love that.</i> <i>PILOT: Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.</i> <i>Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning</i> <i>and send a car with a phone.</i> <i>Oh.</i> <i>He did, too. Money no object.</i> <i>Everything glittered and was golden.</i> <i>Well, on the outside.</i> <i>Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime,</i> <i>he'd gone to all the major networks</i> <i>to try and get interest in the interviews.</i> <i>I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy</i> <i>of not paying for a news interview.</i> <i>Look, we love your work as an entertainer.</i> <i>That Guinness show?</i> <i>Love it. You're a funny guy.</i> But an interview like this? <i>You're asking us to pay a British talk show host</i> to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return? <i>Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.</i> <i>I know you're very busy.</i> <i>I'm not gonna keep you from it.</i> <i>Thank you for coming in.</i> <i>I'm gonna have to get back to you.</i> <i>Okay, thank you so much for your time.</i> <i>David, good luck.</i> He never let on to anyone at the time, <i>not even me. You know, that would have meant.</i> <i>Thanks.</i> <i>.admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.</i> <i>FROST: There you are.</i> <i>See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.</i> (INDISTINCT) <i>Well.</i> <i>You found it okay.</i> <i>Yes, thank you.</i> <i>Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.</i> <i>And you, sir.</i> May I present Caroline Cushing? <i>Miss Cushing.</i> <i>Hello. Your house is very beautiful.</i> <i>Really. Very romantic.</i> <i>Well, thank you.</i> <i>And my producer, John Birt.</i> <i>Nice to meet you. How do you do?</i> <i>This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.</i> Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey? <i>Yes, please. I'd love that. Thank you.</i> <i>Come on in. This is my office.</i> <i>Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.</i> <i>Yeah. Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.</i> <i>We talked for nine hours straight.</i> After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit, <i>I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.</i> <i>Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.</i> Well, we got inside for the photographers, <i>when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.</i> Now, the first rule of political life is <i>you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.</i> <i>I mean, we're not used to doing anything</i> <i>for ourselves, let alone drive.</i> And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was <i>a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.</i> <i>He crashed into curbs.</i> <i>He went over speed bumps.</i> <i>He went twice around my whole estate.</i> Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, <i>out there overlooking the sea.</i> He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours <i>about his favorite subject, steel mills.</i> <i>He said, "Mr. President, most politicians</i> <i>"have tragedy in their early lives."</i> <i>Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.</i> <i>And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.</i> <i>He was a sad man and a noble adversary.</i> <i>I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.</i> <i>They never know when they're being taped.</i> <i>Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?</i> <i>Until March. I look forward to it.</i> <i>Well, thank you, Mr. President. So do I.</i> <i>You know, it's a funny thing that</i> <i>I've never been challenged to a duel before.</i> <i>I guess that's what this is.</i> <i>FROST: Yeah, well, not really.</i> <i>Of course it is.</i> <i>And I like that.</i> <i>No holds barred, eh? No holds barred.</i> <i>Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the.</i> <i>Of course.</i> <i>I do beg your pardon.</i> <i>Right. $200,000.</i> <i>I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.</i> <i>Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.</i> Made out in the name of? <i>Irving Paul Lazar.</i> <i>Richard M. Nixon.</i> <i>Here you go.</i> <i>MANOLO: Okay, smile.</i> <i>There. Now you can put that in your apartment in New York,</i> <i>and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.</i> <i>Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.</i> Really? <i>Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.</i> <i>Hey. Take my advice.</i> <i>You should marry that woman.</i> <i>Yes. Lovely, isn't she?</i> <i>More important than that, she comes from Monaco.</i> <i>They pay no taxes there.</i> <i>Bye-bye. Goodbye.</i> <i>I bet you it did.</i> What? <i>Come out of his own pocket.</i> <i>You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.</i> <i>Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.</i> <i>Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.</i> <i>So if you ask me, there's a good chance</i> <i>this whole thing may never happen.</i> Really? So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000? <i>Correct.</i> <i>Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.</i> Say, did you notice his shoes? <i>No.</i> <i>Italian. No laces. What do you think?</i> <i>My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.</i> <i>I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.</i> You do? <i>Yeah. Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.</i> <i>Yes, quite right.</i> <i>NBC EXECUTIVE: I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.</i> <i>Try to look at it from our point of view.</i> <i>Why would an American network hire a total outsider,</i> <i>and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?</i> <i>I see. Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.</i> <i>Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.</i> <i>NBC.</i> <i>Well, that's the networks out, all of them.</i> <i>Well, that's the end of that, then.</i> <i>I'm sorry, David.</i> <i>Not so fast.</i> <i>Where's your adventurer's spirit?</i> The idea is we pay for the program <i>and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.</i> <i>Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.</i> <i>Hey, Bob. FROST: How does that grab you?</i> <i>Hey, come on in. David's on the phone.</i> <i>FROST: No, never been done before.</i> <i>Historic stuff.</i> <i>Just think about it, okay? And call me back.</i> <i>Yeah? Yeah.</i> <i>David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick,</i> <i>our two prospective corner men.</i> <i>Delighted to meet you.</i> <i>Come on in. Make yourselves at home.</i> <i>Bob's been Washington correspondent</i> <i>for Public Radio for the past 10 years.</i> <i>Moving to ABC in the new year.</i> The general feeling, David, <i>is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.</i> Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, <i>paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.</i> <i>Second on the subject.</i> <i>Fourth.</i> <i>Well, delighted to have you both aboard.</i> Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear <i>what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.</i> What I want to achieve? <i>Yeah.</i> <i>Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.</i> <i>That's close to 30 hours</i> with the most compelling and controversial politician <i>of our times.</i> <i>Isn't that enough?</i> <i>Well, not for me.</i> <i>Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life. I'm leaving my family</i> to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, <i>would be unthinkable to me.</i> <i>(INTERRUPTING) FROST: No, all right.</i> Well, what is it that you want to achieve? <i>I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.</i> <i>Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.</i> <i>Difficult questions.</i> The man lost 21,000 Americans <i>and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.</i> <i>He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.</i> Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, <i>you know, assuming he's a terrible guy,</i> <i>wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?</i> <i>(SIGHS) You know.</i> <i>Right now, I submit it's impossible</i> <i>to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.</i> He devalued the presidency, <i>and he left the country that elected him in trauma.</i> <i>The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.</i> The integrity of our political system, <i>of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.</i> And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, <i>that would be the worst crime of all.</i> Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this? And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke? <i>ZELNICK: Come on. Jim, come on.</i> <i>Thanks for that, Jim.</i> Could you give us a couple of minutes? <i>You're unbelievable. I'm sorry, Bob.</i> <i>You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.</i> <i>I mean, some of us actually want this job.</i> <i>I want it, too, if it's done right.</i> <i>Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?</i> Little Lord Fauntleroy in there? Sympathy for Richard Nixon? <i>What the. He's full of shit, man!</i> How do you know that? Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this? <i>Apparently.</i> <i>Why didn't you tell me?</i> <i>It isn't relevant.</i> <i>What's the angle? "British talk show host,</i> <i>"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."</i> <i>That's the general idea, yeah.</i> <i>Right.</i> <i>It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.</i> <i>Well, Bob's obviously a pro.</i> What are we gonna do about Reston? <i>Well, the man's an idiot. He's overemotional.</i> <i>Send him home.</i> <i>Well, I think he should stay. Why?</i> <i>I liked his passion.</i> <i>He will drive us all bloody mad.</i> Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone <i>is a good thing, I'm told.</i> <i>He stays.</i> <i>I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.</i> <i>Now, one of the challenges of life as a president</i> <i>is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.</i> <i>And people who know me would tell you</i> <i>that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either. No.</i> <i>Particularly not in Mandarin.</i> <i>So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.</i> <i>And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well,</i> <i>they stared at one another, too.</i> <i>And then further down, Dr. Kissinger</i> <i>and their foreign minister, well,</i> <i>you're getting the picture now.</i> <i>I can't stand it, Jack!</i> <i>Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.</i> <i>I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.</i> And I thought I made it clear! <i>I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!</i> Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate! <i>It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.</i> <i>Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance</i> <i>to talk about them sooner than you think.</i> Yeah? How? <i>Frost got there. He got the money.</i> What? <i>I understand most of it's borrowed,</i> <i>that his friends have bailed him out.</i> <i>But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.</i> <i>Really? Now, that's terrific.</i> How much time is devoted to Watergate? <i>25%. Just one of four 90-minute shows.</i> What are the other three divided into? Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, <i>and Nixon the Man.</i> <i>"Nixon the Man"?</i> As opposed to what? Nixon the horse? <i>Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.</i> <i>I can see it now. The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.</i> <i>Spare me.</i> <i>Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?</i> <i>Mr. President, it's fantastic.</i> <i>Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.</i> <i>You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.</i> If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, <i>you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.</i> <i>You think? I'm certain.</i> <i>It would be so good to go back to where the action is.</i> You know? <i>The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.</i> I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh? <i>Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.</i> <i>It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.</i> <i>That stuff's been combed over a million times.</i> <i>No one has pinned anything on you.</i> <i>Yeah, still, it's been a while</i> <i>since I spoke about it on the record.</i> <i>I'm gonna start doing my homework.</i> Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out? <i>What his strategy is.</i> <i>Now, where's he staying?</i> <i>I believe The Beverly Hilton.</i> <i>The Beverly Hilton, you say.</i> Well, I got the numbers someplace <i>of some fellows that we could send in.</i> <i>Cubans with CIA training.</i> <i>Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.</i> <i>Yes, sir.</i> <i>RESTON: A week later, we said goodbye to our families,</i> <i>we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.</i> <i>And that's where we started to dig into our research</i> <i>and prepare for the interviews.</i> Yeah, as it happens, we took <i>the whole question of security very seriously.</i> <i>BIRT: And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.</i> Who was the guy that Mike interviewed? Was that Haldeman? <i>BIRT: Haldeman. RESTON: Haldeman. And Ehrlichman, too.</i> <i>I always get the Germans mixed up.</i> <i>I'm a little confused by that.</i> <i>What is Haldeman's official. Hello, darling.</i> <i>As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.</i> Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, <i>and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.</i> <i>And David, we never really saw much of David.</i> RESTON: All right, so what about the Huston Plan? <i>You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.</i> <i>Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.</i> <i>That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.</i> <i>Wiretapping students.</i> <i>NIXON ON TAPE: But they've traced the money to him.</i> <i>RESTON: Opening people's mail.</i> What about wiretapping? How many people has he wiretapped? <i>This guy wiretapped 17 people.</i> BIRT: Seventeen? <i>Including his own brother.</i> <i>But you know what? We can't ask him about his brother,</i> <i>'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,</i> <i>I'd wiretap him, too.</i> <i>RESTON: But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.</i> <i>We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.</i> <i>And that's Liddy, right?</i> <i>Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's</i> <i>finest deli selection.</i> <i>We're going to need napkins. We'd better have some napkins.</i> How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia? I think you should say, <i>"How far do you take executive privilege</i> <i>"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"</i> <i>I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.</i> <i>"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"</i> <i>FROST: Come on. Are they really interested in buying time?</i> Are they going to give us the money? How serious are they? <i>You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.</i> <i>There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.</i> Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years, <i>I got to play him in our rehearsals.</i> <i>You know, the fellas would throw me a question,</i> <i>and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.</i> <i>BIRT: Okay, the White House taping system.</i> <i>Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.</i> <i>Lyndon Johnson's White House used them. So did Kennedy's.</i> <i>Huston Plan. Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.</i> <i>Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.</i> <i>And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.</i> That man, he screwed anything that moved, <i>fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.</i> And the American people, they loved him for it! Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me! <i>Look. Look. Now I'm sweating.</i> Damn it! Damn it! <i>And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!</i> And women all over him! <i>He screwed anything that moved, and everything.</i> <i>Had a go at Checkers once.</i> The poor little bitch was never the same! <i>Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.</i> <i>CAROLINE: Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,</i> <i>"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras</i> <i>"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,</i> <i>"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.</i> <i>"Frost has hired three crack investigators</i> <i>"to help him with the research.</i> <i>"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."</i> <i>"Crack investigators"?</i> Can I be Crack One? Can I be Deep Crack? David, can I talk to you for a sec? After researching my last book, <i>I was pretty certain Colson.</i> You know, Charles Colson? His darkest henchman? <i>Colson, right. Colson had a meeting with Nixon</i> (PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, <i>so I couldn't find the transcript.</i> <i>But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library.</i> <i>A week? Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.</i> <i>I think this is really good stuff, Dave.</i> Would there be something I could help you with? <i>You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews,</i> <i>we're gonna have to ambush him.</i> <i>We're gonna have to take him by surprise.</i> <i>Don't worry, Jim. We'll get him anyway.</i> <i>Hang on a second. David, Jack Brennan.</i> <i>He sounds a little emotional.</i> <i>I'll take it in here.</i> <i>He'll be right with you. Yeah.</i> <i>Jack. Watergate.</i> <i>Yes, Jack.</i> <i>Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.</i> <i>Well, I believe it's a large hotel</i> <i>and office complex in Washington, Jack.</i> <i>You know what I'm talking about.</i> <i>For the interviews.</i> We want to propose that Watergate <i>be an umbrella term for everything negative.</i> (STAMMERS) <i>Hold on a minute.</i> So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, <i>you're saying all that goes into Watergate?</i> <i>Correct.</i> That is absurd and a clear breach <i>of the terms of our agreement.</i> <i>Okay. How would you define Watergate?</i> <i>Well, that it covers just that.</i> The Watergate break-in of June 17th <i>and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.</i> <i>Fine. In which case, the deal is off.</i> <i>Fine. In which case, you can expect a lawsuit</i> for something in excess of $20 million <i>in damages and loss of earnings.</i> The terms of the contract clearly stipulate <i>that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.</i> Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% <i>he gets to drone on and sound presidential.</i> <i>"Drone on"? Jesus Christ. Where's your respect?</i> <i>You remember who you're talking about here.</i> You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, <i>and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.</i> Yes, but that still leaves 10% <i>where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.</i> <i>You goddamn media people. You are so smug.</i> Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%, <i>I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.</i> <i>Prick.</i> <i>Look at you. Gorgeous.</i> <i>Good night, sweet princes.</i> <i>Cheerio. Bye.</i> <i>See you in the morning.</i> (DOOR CLOSES) Why the monkey suit? <i>David has a film premiere he needs to attend.</i> What? The night before we start taping? <i>What's the movie?</i> <i>It's The Slipper and the Rose.</i> The Cinderella movie? <i>Yeah. David's the executive producer.</i> <i>You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer</i> to be rested and focused on the job in hand? <i>BIRT: Don't worry.</i> <i>David is a performer of the highest caliber.</i> <i>He's been in these pressure situations many times before.</i> <i>Come the hour, he'll be fine. Okay?</i> <i>What did he say? Did he say "performer"?</i> <i>Yeah. That's the word he used?</i> <i>Yeah, he said "performer."</i> <i>Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?</i> <i>No. He said "performer."</i> Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment? Psychically? I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to <i>by my Washington political colleagues.</i> (CHEERING) So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, <i>go right to Khrushchev.</i> Just go right! <i>KHACHIGIAN: You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.</i> <i>PRICE: I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.</i> <i>Excuse me, sir. Something I think you should see.</i> <i>GANNON: People love that story.</i> <i>SAWYER: Why don't we save it for the book?</i> <i>KHACHIGIAN: Yeah, right, come on.</i> <i>REPORTER 1: David. REPORTER 2: Mr. Frost.</i> <i>REPORTER 1: David, some people in the media have suggested</i> <i>that you're not the right man for the job,</i> <i>that you'll be too soft on the President.</i> <i>What will you do if he stonewalls you?</i> <i>FROST: Well, I shall say so again and again.</i> <i>But I should say right now that I'm not expecting</i> <i>his approach to be to stonewall.</i> <i>I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.</i> <i>REPORTER 1: "A cascade of candor"?</i> <i>From Richard Nixon?</i> <i>You think that's what you'll get?</i> <i>No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.</i> <i>REPORTER 1: So what about the money?</i> <i>That's a strange fellow.</i> <i>Started life as a comic, you know.</i> <i>NIXON: Is that so? Mmm-hmm.</i> <i>Almost married Diahann Carroll.</i> Who? <i>GANNON: The singer.</i> <i>Isn't she black?</i> <i>Yes, sir.</i> Right here in the Frost file, which we put together <i>as part of our general preparations.</i> <i>Okay. Let's get back to work.</i> <i>FROST: That's fact, this is fiction.</i> <i>So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.</i> <i>It's a cracker of a movie.</i> <i>I hope you'll all come and see it, and.</i> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) <i>I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.</i> <i>Just don't drink any more.</i> (INAUDIBLE) <i>Good luck. Thank you.</i> <i>I'll be thinking of you.</i> <i>Dick. Wait.</i> <i>FROST: For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.</i> <i>"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"</i> <i>No. Fuck.</i> <i>Please, God, no! You can't.</i> <i>David, you can't do that. It would be a disaster.</i> <i>It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.</i> What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects <i>if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?</i> <i>'Cause it's war, isn't it? Gloves off.</i> <i>I like it. It's ballsy.</i> <i>Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.</i> <i>It's insanely risky.</i> He could walk right off the set, <i>and there's nothing we could do about it.</i> Worse, he could sue you! We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, <i>which was owned by a local Republican businessman.</i> (REPORTERS CLAMORING) PHOTOGRAPHER: Right here! <i>Mr. Frost, look over here.</i> Over here, sir! <i>Here we go. OFFICER: Back up behind the curb.</i> <i>REPORTER 1 : A few questions, please.</i> <i>PHOTOGRAPHER: Right here, Mr. Frost.</i> REPORTER 2: David! David! David! (ALL CLAMORING) <i>FROST: Well, hello there.</i> (SIREN BLARING) <i>Excuse me, fellas.</i> <i>MAN: Nixon, there's blood on your hands!</i> WOMAN: Liar! MAN: Here comes the President! <i>REPORTER 1 : Mr. President!</i> <i>REPORTER 2: Mr. President!</i> <i>REPORTER 3: How are you feeling, Mr. President?</i> (REPORTERS CLAMORING) <i>The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.</i> They talked to you about that, too? <i>They're bugging everybody.</i> <i>RESTON: You know, I've written four books about him,</i> <i>but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.</i> <i>He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.</i> <i>The least he could do is look ravaged.</i> You gonna shake his hand? <i>Am I gonna shake.</i> Are you kidding me? <i>After everything that prick's done to this country?</i> <i>I'm not gonna shake his hand.</i> <i>Gentlemen.</i> May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor? How do you do? <i>Pleasure, Mr. President.</i> <i>FROST: And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.</i> <i>Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.</i> <i>Mr. President.</i> <i>Excuse me, sir? Got a room for you right here.</i> <i>Wow. That was devastating, withering.</i> <i>I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.</i> <i>Yeah, fuck off.</i> (CHUCKLES) <i>I got you guys set up back here.</i> <i>Now this is your green room.</i> <i>And the President will be on the large monitor.</i> <i>Craft services is that way.</i> Keep it about that temperature, okay? <i>Mr. President?</i> <i>Yeah.</i> Before we start, I just want to say <i>how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.</i> <i>Well, thank you. It's true.</i> <i>She's much better now.</i> <i>She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.</i> And from our point of view, well, <i>I'd just like to say how pleased we are</i> <i>that you got this all together.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.</i> <i>Well.</i> How much has it cost? <i>You mind me asking? Hey, come on.</i> <i>Come on, it's just between us.</i> <i>Very well. Two million.</i> <i>Two million? Jeez. I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.</i> (LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY) <i>But tell me something.</i> You raised it all now? (HESITATES) <i>Not quite. But we're getting there.</i> <i>Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.</i> <i>Well, not quite everyone.</i> <i>David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.</i> <i>Excuse me.</i> <i>I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.</i> Is that out of shot? <i>That's fine, Mr. President.</i> Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question <i>I might dab my upper lip before answering it.</i> <i>Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.</i> <i>You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.</i> <i>If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.</i> <i>They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.</i> <i>People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.</i> But television and the close-up, <i>they create their own sets of meanings.</i> So now they insist I bring a handkerchief <i>and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.</i> <i>Sixty seconds, everyone.</i> <i>You trim yours? No.</i> <i>No, of course not.</i> <i>Yeah, you're light-skinned. Yeah.</i> <i>You got blue eyes. You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.</i> <i>No, not that I'm aware.</i> <i>You were obviously born to be on the tube.</i> <i>DAVIS: Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.</i> <i>Settling.</i> <i>Those shoes.</i> <i>They're Italian, aren't they?</i> <i>My shoes? I believe so.</i> <i>Yeah, that's interesting.</i> (SNIFFLES) <i>You don't find them too effeminate?</i> <i>No.</i> Well, I guess somebody in your field <i>can get away with them, you know.</i> Manolo, just check my collar, will you? DIRECTOR: David, starting with camera two, <i>in four, three, two. Cue David. And.</i> <i>Mr. President. Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects</i> in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, <i>but I'd like to begin completely out of context</i> by asking you one question, more than any other, almost every American <i>and people all over the world want me to ask.</i> <i>Why didn't you burn the tapes?</i> Son of a bitch! <i>Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question</i> since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, <i>that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.</i> But if your viewers really do have a major concern, <i>then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.</i> What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was a record kept of every verbal agreement, <i>no matter how off the cuff or casual.</i> Now, initially, on coming into the White House, <i>I insisted on dismantling the system.</i> <i>I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,</i> President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, <i>which he felt was the best way.</i> <i>BRENNAN: Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment,</i> <i>and you see it in the challenger's face.</i> <i>It's that moment that he feels</i> <i>the impact from the champ's first jab.</i> <i>It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that</i> all those months of pep talks and the hype, <i>the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.</i> <i>You could see it in Frost's face.</i> <i>If he didn't know the caliber of the man</i> that he was up against before the interview started, <i>he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.</i> NIXON: You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable <i>speaking in confidence at the White House.</i> <i>They're less likely to offer that advice. So in the end,</i> <i>it's the whole political system and,</i> <i>by implication, it's the country that suffers.</i> <i>So much for our "ballsy" opening.</i> <i>So when did you actually decide.</i> At what moment did you know you were going to resign? <i>That's good. That's good.</i> <i>I remember exactly. It was July 23.</i> After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had <i>had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.</i> <i>That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it. There goes the presidency."</i> And, of course, you know, being Al, <i>he tried to talk me out of it.</i> <i>And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget</i> he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, <i>and comfortably. John, we have to do something.</i> <i>We have to move this along.</i> <i>This is desperate, John. Do something.</i> Twenty-three minutes on one question? <i>Okay, let's take a break.</i> <i>Let's change the tapes. Come on, man.</i> <i>Stop tape.</i> <i>DIRECTOR: I'm sorry, gentlemen.</i> <i>We have to take a break. Tape change.</i> <i>Oh. Okay, how's that? You getting what you need?</i> <i>It's fantastic.</i> <i>Good. Good. Thank you.</i> <i>Excuse me. One moment, sir.</i> <i>NIXON: Yeah, sure. Take your time.</i> <i>What are you doing, David? You've got to stop him rambling.</i> <i>It's all right. These are just introductory exchanges.</i> <i>But this session only lasts two hours.</i> <i>Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?</i> The moment that he made the decision to resign, <i>we should be scoring points with that stuff.</i> Want me to switch to Vietnam? <i>No. No. We've got to get something</i> <i>out of that resignation night. All right?</i> <i>That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck. On his knees?</i> <i>Praying with Kissinger? Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.</i> Listen, was that okay? <i>Perfect, sir.</i> <i>It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?</i> <i>Not at all. You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.</i> <i>Good.</i> <i>Now continue exactly the same way.</i> <i>Long answers. Control the space.</i> <i>Don't let him in.</i> <i>Okay, got you.</i> <i>DAVIS: Set. And roll.</i> <i>We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and.</i> Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came <i>in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.</i> Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career? <i>RESTON: Good, good. NIXON: Yes.</i> <i>I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.</i> <i>Except, well, you know, it's hard to say</i> what is the most emotional moment, <i>because each is different.</i> <i>I remember the day Eisenhower died.</i> <i>For God's sake.</i> <i>And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.</i> And the day during the impeachment hearings <i>when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office,</i> <i>she threw her arms around me, she kissed me. She cried, you know?</i> <i>And she so seldom cries.</i> <i>She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."</i> <i>"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?</i> <i>"And whatever you do, I will support you.</i> <i>"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."</i> <i>This is beautiful.</i> So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce <i>about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.</i> There was China, the Soviet Union, <i>the peace settlement in Vietnam.</i> <i>Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.</i> <i>Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make.</i> <i>Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.</i> <i>I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.</i> <i>"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker. You're a Jew.</i> <i>"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,</i> <i>"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way</i> <i>"has a deep religious sensitivity.</i> <i>"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"</i> <i>So we knelt down. Now, this was in front of that table where</i> <i>Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.</i> <i>And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says.</i> <i>Is there. I'm sorry.</i> Is there a problem? <i>That's time.</i> <i>We're over two hours.</i> Really? So soon? <i>Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.</i> <i>Gee, now, that's a pity.</i> <i>You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.</i> <i>That was terrific, both of you.</i> <i>We're getting some great material.</i> <i>You know, it's so funny, too,</i> <i>because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.</i> <i>And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?</i> <i>Yes, so did I.</i> <i>I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.</i> <i>Indeed.</i> So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right? <i>Yes, indeed.</i> <i>I look forward to it. Bye-bye.</i> <i>There's no need to say anything.</i> <i>REPORTER 1 : Mr. President! REPORTER 2: Mr. President!</i> (REPORTERS CLAMORING) <i>REPORTER 3: Mr. President!</i> <i>REPORTER 4: Mr. President, please!</i> (WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him? <i>I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.</i> <i>He's gotta be able to shut him up. Shh.</i> <i>David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think.</i> <i>Don't worry, Bob. I'm on it.</i> <i>We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.</i> <i>Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later.</i> <i>Look, I'm disappointed, too.</i> But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now? <i>I don't mean to minimize it. It's just I've got to get back to LA</i> <i>to meet some people from Weed Eater.</i> Thanks, everyone! Great work! <i>Marv, Lloyd, great day. Bye, David.</i> <i>I'll see you soon. God bless!</i> What the hell is Weed Eater? <i>It's a horticultural mechanism.</i> <i>One of our sponsors.</i> What happened to Xerox? What about General Motors or IBM? <i>I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.</i> <i>We do have Alpo.</i> Dog food? <i>(STUTTERING) Wait, John. We're already taping.</i> <i>So we're close, right? We're very close?</i> <i>That's probably a question you should ask David.</i> Are we close, John? <i>I believe we're at 30%.</i> To go? Or 30% sold? <i>Again, that's probably a question you should.</i> <i>Sold, 30% sold.</i> <i>Jesus.</i> <i>I thought we were practically fully financed.</i> <i>We were. But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales,</i> <i>and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.</i> Well, why have they fallen apart? Based on what? <i>Credibility of the project. What else are advertising sales based on?</i> <i>Listen, I understand your concern.</i> But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, <i>bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?</i> <i>'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.</i> <i>So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.</i> <i>And we're not?</i> <i>FROST: You seemed very confident last time.</i> <i>I don't understand. Why this sudden change of heart?</i> <i>All right, this is just madness. It's Richard Nixon.</i> <i>These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.</i> <i>Jimmy! Yes. Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.</i> Look, I hate to do this to a friend, <i>and I know you're already in for more than I asked for,</i> <i>but I need you to dig a little deeper.</i> <i>I'm right up against it now.</i> <i>So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.</i> And? <i>Honestly? Far too soft, David.</i> <i>Go on. Beat me, John. Beat me with a stick.</i> <i>Look. No, I'm serious.</i> <i>You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.</i> <i>You can start by sitting forward. You've gotta attack more.</i> If he starts tailing off, bang, <i>jump in with another question.</i> <i>Don't trade generalizations.</i> <i>Be specific.</i> <i>And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.</i> <i>Right. And keep your distance</i> <i>before the tape starts running.</i> <i>He was toying with you yesterday.</i> <i>All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.</i> <i>Those are mind games. Don't engage.</i> <i>Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.</i> <i>Got it.</i> (NIXON CLEARS THROAT) <i>Ah.</i> The Grand Inquisitor! <i>No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.</i> (GLASS SMASHING) <i>It's okay. We just blew a bulb.</i> <i>NIXON: This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.</i> <i>There's nothing to worry about.</i> <i>As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.</i> <i>DAVIS: Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.</i> <i>(WHISPERING) Focus, sir. Yeah.</i> <i>Okay, we are back. Okay, take it on my count.</i> <i>Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.</i> <i>DAVIS: Settling.</i> You have a pleasant evening last night? <i>Yes, thank you.</i> Did you do any fornicating? <i>David, we're starting with camera two in four,</i> (CLEARS THROAT) <i>three, two and.</i> <i>Mr. President, you came to office promising peace,</i> but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged <i>with calamitous consequences.</i> <i>Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?</i> <i>Well, Vietnam was not my war.</i> <i>It was my inheritance.</i> <i>And it looked to me. Jump in.</i> <i>.as if the reason for our being there</i> <i>had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.</i> <i>It seemed to me they hadn't realized</i> <i>how important a test this was of American credibility.</i> The whole world was watching to see <i>if we have the character to see it through.</i> <i>Now, look, I could have bugged out. I could have.</i> <i>I could have blamed it on my predecessors.</i> I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won <i>some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.</i> <i>But I believed in the cause.</i> <i>And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.</i> <i>You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.</i> <i>Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.</i> <i>Come on, David, Cambodia.</i> <i>And Cambodia? An invasion which everybody advised you against.</i> <i>All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.</i> So why did you do it? Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles, <i>15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.</i> <i>That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese,</i> which would only otherwise have been directed <i>right onto American soldiers.</i> But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of <i>the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"</i> <i>a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.</i> <i>No, no. Wait a minute there. No, I was. And by sending.</i> And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment <i>and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge</i> <i>that would lead to civil war.</i> <i>All right! .and genocide.</i> <i>Yes, good, good, good. There it is.</i> <i>Okay, run VT.</i> <i>Roll tape.</i> <i>Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree,</i> <i>some pretty stirring images there.</i> <i>Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians. That's the enemy's way.</i> <i>Well, I'm not suggesting.</i> <i>And if you're asking the question</i> <i>do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.</i> <i>Let me tell you something. It can just wear you down.</i> <i>Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who.</i> But whenever I have had my doubts, I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me <i>and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.</i> <i>"If you'd gone in earlier,</i> <i>"you might have captured the gun</i> <i>"that killed my boy three months ago."</i> <i>So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?</i> <i>No! I don't. You know what?</i> <i>I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.</i> <i>SAWYER: Got him. Safe!</i> <i>It was horrifying. It was horrifying. And he was so confident.</i> (REPORTERS CLAMORING) REPORTER: What are you gonna say about Watergate? Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know? Better? <i>It was. Unquestionably better.</i> <i>What's next?</i> <i>Foreign policy.</i> <i>Great. Russia, China, the big power stuff.</i> Yeah, so? So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, <i>imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.</i> (RESTON LAUGHS) <i>It ain't gonna be pretty.</i> <i>The answer was grow by six inches.</i> <i>It was agony to watch.</i> <i>Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.</i> <i>You see, he and Mao didn't get along,</i> and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman <i>would talk to me, no one else.</i> <i>You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.</i> When David tried to lay a finger on him, <i>Nixon made mincemeat out of him.</i> <i>ZELNICK: What "revolution," David?</i> You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution? <i>What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?</i> <i>That's not how I remember it.</i> What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War! <i>That's what I remember. Music off, please. Off.</i> <i>By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes</i> <i>was beginning to sound like a rational response.</i> <i>Well, I'm sorry you feel this way,</i> <i>but I simply cannot share your view.</i> About what exactly? About any of it, frankly! <i>I thought today was a huge improvement.</i> Are you nuts? <i>Let me tell you how bad things were today.</i> After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, <i>but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.</i> <i>You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!</i> <i>And forget about the trivia, David.</i> Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled? I do! <i>Well, it's irrelevant!</i> <i>And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk.</i> A what? <i>Go on. No, say it.</i> <i>What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?</i> <i>Yeah. Yeah, I was.</i> <i>All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.</i> <i>Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.</i> And this ridiculous self-flagellation, <i>in my view, is just depressing.</i> No! <i>And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.</i> <i>Look. If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail,</i> they better leave now, <i>or it'll infect everyone else.</i> No one? <i>Right.</i> <i>Good.</i> Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, <i>we all go our separate ways over Easter.</i> But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner <i>at Patrick Terrail's new place.</i> Celebrate? Celebrate what, David? <i>The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?</i> <i>What are we celebrating? It's my birthday, Bob!</i> <i>I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.</i> (PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE) Look, is that Neil Diamond? <i>(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon</i> And is that Sammy Cahn? <i>Go together like Prancer and Vixen</i> David, did you hear that? <i>Soaring through the airwaves</i> <i>Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.</i> <i>Oh, my God.</i> <i>Hoping for several hefty paydays</i> <i>Yeah, I think it is. With Michael York.</i> <i>That's gotta be Bunnies.</i> Those are Bunnies? Those are real Bunnies? <i>Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon</i> <i>Go together like Mason and Dixon</i> <i>David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.</i> <i>Frost lines up with Dicky.</i> <i>No one else could have done that.</i> And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations <i>of academics and political historians.</i> That bad? <i>He saved it</i> <i>He wrote a book Now here's the hook</i> David! <i>Patrick.</i> <i>He's not a crook He's paid by David</i> (GUESTS APPLAUDING) (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) <i>My, what a festive atmosphere. Please, don't get up.</i> I take it from this that the interviews have gone well? <i>Better than that, ma'am. It's a shutout.</i> <i>The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.</i> <i>Really? Well. Yeah.</i> <i>Well, that is most gratifying.</i> <i>I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.</i> <i>(SIGHS) I see.</i> Is there nothing we can do? Really? <i>(SIGHING) Right. Well, thanks for letting me know.</i> <i>It's true. They've dropped the Australian show.</i> <i>Oh, no, David.</i> <i>They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.</i> <i>Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.</i> <i>I'm in this for everything I've got,</i> <i>and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.</i> <i>What have I done? What was I thinking? Why didn't anyone stop me?</i> They should have physically stopped me! <i>No, no, no. Shh.</i> <i>Look, we don't have to go out tonight. Why don't we stay in?</i> Hmm? <i>I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.</i> Steak or fish? David? <i>Don't worry. I'll call from the restaurant.</i> (DOOR CLOSES) (TELEPHONE RINGING) <i>I'll have a cheeseburger.</i> <i>NIXON: Mmm. That sounds good. I used to love cheeseburgers,</i> <i>but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.</i> <i>He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.</i> He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, <i>but they don't taste like burgers at all.</i> <i>They taste like Styrofoam.</i> <i>I hope I'm not disturbing.</i> <i>No.</i> <i>It's a Friday night.</i> <i>You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.</i> <i>No.</i> Well, then what are you doing? <i>A handsome young fellow,</i> <i>an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.</i> <i>If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.</i> <i>The all-important final session.</i> <i>Yes. Watergate.</i> <i>'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine</i> <i>whether these interviews are a success or a failure.</i> Should I be nervous? <i>Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.</i> <i>Quite right. No holds barred. No holds barred.</i> <i>You know, it's strange.</i> Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, <i>and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.</i> One of my people, as part of the preparation <i>for this interview, she did a profile on you.</i> <i>And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.</i> <i>There's some interesting stuff in there.</i> Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, <i>and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.</i> What was it? Oxford? <i>Cambridge.</i> Did the snobs there look down on you, too? (CHUCKLES) <i>Of course they did. That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?</i> <i>No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.</i> <i>I really don't know what you're talking about.</i> <i>Yes, you do.</i> <i>Now, come on. No matter how many awards</i> or column inches are written about you <i>or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.</i> We still feel like the little man, <i>the loser they told us we were a hundred times.</i> The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, <i>the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.</i> <i>And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch,</i> <i>scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?</i> <i>If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment,</i> if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, <i>isn't that why we're here now? The two of us?</i> Looking for a way back into the sun, <i>into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.</i> <i>Because we could feel it slipping away.</i> We were headed, both of us, for the dirt! <i>A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.</i> <i>Face in the dust.</i> <i>Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.</i> Well, to hell with that! <i>We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.</i> <i>We're gonna show those bums.</i> <i>We're gonna make them choke on our continued success,</i> our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory! We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke! Am I right? <i>You are. Except only one of us can win.</i> <i>Yes.</i> <i>And I shall be your fiercest adversary.</i> I shall come at you with everything I got, <i>because the limelight can only shine on one of us.</i> <i>And for the other, it'll be the wilderness,</i> with nothing and no one for company <i>but those voices ringing in our head.</i> <i>You can probably tell I've had a drink.</i> <i>It's not too many. Just one or two.</i> But you believe me, <i>when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.</i> <i>Good night, Mr. Frost.</i> <i>Good night,</i> <i>Mr. President.</i> <i>So with or without cheese? I brought burgers.</i> David? <i>I've got to work.</i> <i>NIXON ON TAPE: Well, who was the asshole that did?</i> <i>Jesus, is that Liddy?</i> <i>He must be a little nuts.</i> <i>HALDEMAN: Yeah, he is.</i> <i>NIXON: I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?</i> <i>Isn't that the problem?</i> <i>Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.</i> <i>But no more sucking around. From now on, they come to me.</i> <i>There is one thing that I want done,</i> <i>and I don't want any argument about it.</i> <i>I want you to direct the most trusted person you have</i> <i>in the Immigration Service</i> <i>that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.</i> <i>All, underlined. And they are to send their teams in to see</i> <i>whether they are violating the wetback thing.</i> <i>Is that clear? MITCHELL: Yes, sir.</i> (TAPE REWINDING) <i>NIXON: You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that</i> <i>we just feel that it would be very detrimental</i> <i>to have this thing go any further.</i> (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? <i>Jim, it's David.</i> <i>Hey. What time is it?</i> <i>How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?</i> <i>Tuesday. Till Tuesday.</i> <i>Great. Well, you remember you mentioned</i> going to the Federal Courthouse library? (BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please? Yes, for the Colson stuff? <i>Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end,</i> <i>and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting</i> <i>between Nixon and Colson?</i> <i>Uh-huh. What are you thinking?</i> (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING CONTINUES) <i>Hey. Hey.</i> <i>Good morning.</i> And? <i>(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)</i> <i>Excuse me, sir.</i> <i>It's 8:30. Bob, have you seen David?</i> <i>No. No Frost, no Reston.</i> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) <i>Morning. Good morning. Come on, let's go.</i> <i>What's that about?</i> <i>BIRT: First time he's late.</i> <i>REPORTER: Mr. President!</i> (CROWD CLAMORING) <i>Morning.</i> (DOOR OPENS) (INDISTINCT) <i>Mr. President.</i> <i>Mr. Frost.</i> DAVIS: Thirty seconds to tape roll! <i>Thirty seconds. Settling. Settle.</i> <i>Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.</i> What phone call? <i>The phone call to my hotel room.</i> <i>DAVIS: David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and.</i> Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice? <i>No.</i> <i>And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."</i> Now, you perhaps have not read the statute <i>with regard to the obstruction of justice.</i> <i>As it happens, I have.</i> <i>You have, you say? Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.</i> <i>It requires a specific corrupt motive.</i> <i>And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.</i> <i>What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.</i> Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars <i>would have escaped criminal prosecution.</i> Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice? <i>Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost,</i> that far from obstructing justice, <i>I was actively facilitating it.</i> When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6, <i>I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."</i> <i>That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.</i> Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately <i>trying to contain or block the investigation.</i> <i>No, no. Hang on a minute there. I wasn't.</i> <i>No, no. Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice,</i> <i>whether it's for a minute or five minutes,</i> <i>and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.</i> <i>I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.</i> <i>I still tried to rob the bank.</i> <i>Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?</i> <i>There is no evidence of any kind that I was.</i> Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period <i>have mysteriously been erased.</i> <i>That was an unfortunate oversight.</i> And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous <i>and a conscientious note taker.</i> <i>His notes are there for all to see.</i> Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, <i>which I don't think has ever been published.</i> <i>Okay, here we go.</i> <i>It hasn't been published, you say?</i> No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington <i>where it's available to anyone who consults the records.</i> <i>Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.</i> <i>More than seen it, Mr. President.</i> <i>You spoke the actual words.</i> <i>Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.</i> <i>Yeah.</i> But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier <i>clearly shows that to be a falsehood.</i> <i>Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests</i> <i>"unless one of the seven begins to talk.</i> <i>"That's the problem."</i> Well, what do we mean when we say <i>"one of the seven beginning to talk"?</i> Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean <i>on March 21, the following year.</i> In one transcript alone, there in black and white, I picked out, and these are your words, <i>one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.</i> <i>"I know where it could be gotten."</i> <i>Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."</i> <i>Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"</i> <i>Four, "Get the million bucks.</i> <i>"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."</i> <i>Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"</i> <i>Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.</i> <i>"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.</i> <i>"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."</i> <i>Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt</i> <i>"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"</i> <i>Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."</i> <i>And I could go on. Now, it seems to me</i> that someone running a cover-up <i>couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?</i> Look, let me just stop you now right there, <i>because you're doing something here</i> which I am not doing, and I will not do <i>throughout these entire broadcasts.</i> <i>You're quoting me out of context,</i> <i>out of order. And I might add,</i> I have participated in all these interviews <i>without a single note in front of me.</i> <i>Well, it is your life, Mr. President.</i> <i>Now, you've always maintained</i> <i>that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.</i> But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 <i>of hush money to be paid to the burglars.</i> Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that? <i>None. I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.</i> <i>To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.</i> Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, <i>and at airports by people with gloves on.</i> <i>That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?</i> <i>Look, I have made statements to this effect before.</i> <i>All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.</i> <i>I knew nothing. Okay, fine. Fine!</i> <i>You made a conclusion there.</i> <i>I stated my view, now let's move on.</i> <i>Let's get on to the rest of it.</i> <i>No, hold on. No, hold on.</i> <i>No, I don't want to talk.</i> If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, <i>why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?</i> <i>Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?</i> <i>Yeah, maybe I should have done that. Maybe I should have.</i> Just called the feds into my office <i>and said, "Hey, there's the two men.</i> <i>"Haul them down to the dock,</i> <i>"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."</i> <i>I'm not made that way.</i> <i>These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.</i> <i>I knew them since they were just kids.</i> Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming! <i>So I did it. I cut off one arm,</i> <i>then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!</i> And I have always maintained what they were doing, <i>what we were all doing, was not criminal.</i> <i>Look, when you're in office,</i> you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them <i>because they're in the greater interests of the nation!</i> <i>Right. Wait, just so I understand correctly,</i> are you really saying that in certain situations, <i>the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation</i> and then do something illegal? <i>I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.</i> <i>I'm sorry?</i> <i>That's what I believe.</i> <i>Oh, my God.</i> <i>But I realize no one else shares that view.</i> So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law? <i>Oh, my God, we got him. NIXON: I.</i> Shit! (DOOR OPENS) <i>Okay, let's take a break there.</i> What the fuck is going on? <i>Cut it. Cut it.</i> <i>Excuse me? Shut it down.</i> <i>Shut it down now.</i> <i>DAVIS: That's not my call. You're gonna have to talk to the director.</i> <i>He's in that truck out there. BRENNAN: Get him in here.</i> <i>DAVIS: Listen, we have an issue in here.</i> Jack, what are you doing? A break? <i>Change the tapes.</i> David, can I talk to you for a minute, please? What the hell is going on, Jack? <i>He was about to blow and you know it.</i> <i>Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.</i> You realize we could sue you for this? <i>You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.</i> <i>BRENNAN: Look, we're all in this together.</i> <i>I'm sure we can find a solution.</i> <i>ZELNICK: A solution? What the hell are you talking about? It's an interview!</i> <i>KHACHIGIAN: Bob, may I remind you.</i> <i>BIRT: This is a breach of contract. We could sue.</i> (ALL ARGUING) <i>For heaven's sake, Jim. Why don't you give him a week off?</i> Give him a year off! Give him a fucking massage! <i>GANNON: Watch your language, for crying out loud.</i> (ALL ARGUING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) <i>What'd you do? Throw in the towel, Jack?</i> Did you take pity on me? Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment <i>to think it through, sketch it out.</i> I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences <i>unplanned emotional disclosures could have.</i> <i>I know.</i> <i>But to go on and carry on denying it all.</i> <i>I appreciate the gesture.</i> <i>We ought to call it a snafu.</i> (WHISPERING) Jack, are we on? <i>We're on. Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up</i> <i>some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.</i> <i>Listen, it's gonna be fine. Pick up where you left off.</i> <i>Thirty seconds, everyone.</i> <i>DAVIS: Ten seconds.</i> <i>David? Four, three, two, and.</i> <i>Mr. President, we were talking about</i> the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering <i>would you go further than "mistakes"?</i> <i>The word that seems not enough for people to understand.</i> Well, what word would you express? (EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF) <i>My goodness.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>Since you've asked me, I think there are three things</i> <i>that people would like to hear you say.</i> <i>One, that there was probably more than mistakes.</i> <i>There was wrongdoing.</i> <i>And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.</i> <i>Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."</i> <i>And thirdly, "I put the American people</i> <i>"through two years of needless agony,</i> <i>"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is</i> for anyone, especially you, <i>but I think the people need to hear it.</i> And I think that unless you say it, <i>you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.</i> <i>Well, it's true. I made mistakes, horrendous ones,</i> ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence <i>that I always dreamed of as a young boy.</i> <i>But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.</i> I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, <i>a partisan Ervin Committee.</i> But, yes, I will admit there were times I did not fully meet that responsibility <i>and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.</i> <i>And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.</i> <i>No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.</i> Now, <i>if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel.</i> No! Never! <i>I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.</i> <i>They were not mistakes of the head.</i> <i>But they were my mistakes. I don't blame anybody.</i> <i>I brought myself down.</i> I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, <i>and they twisted it with relish.</i> <i>And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.</i> And the American people? <i>I let them down.</i> <i>I let down my friends.</i> <i>I let down the country.</i> And worst of all, <i>I let down our system of government.</i> And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, <i>but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.</i> <i>Yeah.</i> (SIGHS) I let the American people down, <i>and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me</i> <i>for the rest of my life.</i> <i>My political life is over.</i> You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, <i>great, complex ideas, tranches of time.</i> <i>Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.</i> <i>At first, I couldn't understand why</i> Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric <i>as he was after the interviews,</i> <i>or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked</i> <i>and rush into the ocean to celebrate.</i> But that was before I really understood <i>the reductive power of the close-up.</i> Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee <i>or political enemy had managed to get.</i> <i>Richard Nixon's face,</i> <i>swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.</i> <i>The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten,</i> <i>they would totally cease to exist.</i> (CAMERAS CLICKING) (REPORTERS CLAMORING) <i>REPORTER: Who came out on top, Mr. President?</i> Is this what you call a dachshund? <i>Mmm-hmm.</i> <i>Very sweet.</i> (ENGINE STARTING) <i>The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.</i> I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program <i>in the history of American television.</i> <i>David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.</i> <i>And even the political press corps,</i> <i>the hard-bitten political press corps,</i> <i>called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.</i> <i>David, I want to say congratulations.</i> The interviews? <i>No, I didn't watch them. I couldn't.</i> <i>(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)</i> <i>Hey.</i> <i>Hello.</i> <i>I believe David saw the former President just one more time.</i> Before he left California for London again, <i>he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.</i> <i>Hey, Mr. Frost. It's nice to see you.</i> <i>Miss Cushing. Hello.</i> <i>Please excuse my golf outfit.</i> <i>It's the official uniform of the retired.</i> Are you on your way home? <i>Yes.</i> Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh? <i>Well, let's hope so.</i> <i>Good for you.</i> <i>I didn't catch the interviews as they went out,</i> <i>but they tell me that they were a great success.</i> I gather the journalists that were so positive <i>about you weren't so kind to me.</i> <i>Yes, I was sorry to see that.</i> <i>There's no condolences necessary.</i> <i>I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.</i> <i>Yeah.</i> <i>Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.</i> <i>You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"</i> but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, <i>and he hates me to defame animals.</i> Can I get something for somebody? <i>Yes. Would you like some tea or champagne?</i> <i>Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.</i> <i>No, thank you. You sure?</i> <i>Come on. It'll be no trouble at all.</i> <i>No, really, we must be.</i> <i>Okay, fine, fine. Thanks for coming by.</i> <i>You were a worthy opponent.</i> <i>Goodbye, Mr. President.</i> <i>Bye-bye.</i> <i>Goodbye, Mr. President.</i> <i>Goodbye.</i> <i>Oh, God! I almost forgot. I.</i> <i>I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.</i> <i>I brought you a pair.</i> <i>Well, jeez. Thank you.</i> <i>I'm touched. Safe trip, now.</i> Oh! Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute? Do you know those parties of yours? The ones that I read about in all the papers? Do you actually enjoy those? <i>Of course.</i> <i>You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.</i> <i>You know? Liking people, and being liked.</i> <i>Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.</i> <i>I don't have it. I never did.</i> It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life <i>that hinged on being liked.</i> <i>I'm better suited to a life of thought,</i> <i>debate, intellectual discipline.</i> <i>Maybe we got it wrong.</i> Maybe you should have been a politician <i>and I the rigorous interviewer.</i> <i>Maybe.</i> <i>David.</i> Did I really call you that night? <i>Yes.</i> Did we discuss anything important? <i>Cheeseburgers.</i> Cheeseburgers? <i>Goodbye, sir.</i> <i>RESTON: Well, New York, London and Sydney</i> <i>welcomed David back with open arms,</i> <i>as did his friends and investors,</i> <i>who've made a fortune from these interviews.</i> <i>He got back all of his shows.</i> <i>He even got back his table at Sardi's.</i> <i>As for Richard Nixon,</i> <i>well, he certainly never achieved</i> <i>the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.</i> His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing <i>is immediately given the suffix "gate."</i> What happened? The lights went out. Why? This is normal. The lights are out all over the world. The lights are out all over Egypt. Everything is like this it's not just the electricity. Electricity is the least of our problems. And all the little kids in the streets say, "Turn the lights back on man. " Who is the "man"? The man who's responsible for switching the electricity back on. The regime. - Are you recording? - Yes - Really recording? - Yes Ok. Do as you like. Let me tell you how this whole story began. Egypt was living without dignity. Injustice existed everywhere. Before the revolution I lived from one job to the next. I started working when I was 8 years old. In fifth grade, I used to pay my school tuition By selling lemons in the street. There was no hope for a better future in this country. We were tied down by an unjust regime and its dictator. Mubarak was the head of the regime That forced us to live for 30 years under emergency law. I lived my entire life under Mubarak's injustice. The regime always worked against the people. They would torture, electrocute, beat the shit out of people. No one dared to speak about politics. Politics was for the regime only. Oh my God people. <i>"KHALED SAEED, VICTIM OF TORTURE"</i> We want to go to Tahrir Square If we have any dignity and want to live as humans in this country Then we have to go to the streets. We will go down and demand our fundamental human rights. I am going down and I will say "No" to corruption. "No" to this regime. I went to the streets. I found everyone around me Felt just as I did. <i>The people want to end corruption.</i> <i>Peaceful</i> The police tried to divide us with all they had. People got angry And broke their fears. I'm not afraid for myself. I'm afraid for you. And for what the future holds. Everyone is in the streets. Come down for God's sake. Tell those who have been sleeping in shit. For the sake of your kids and family, so you can live. Go ahead Sir. I would like to address Egypt's youth in Tahrir Square. I speak to all of you from the heart, Like a father to his sons and daughters. I take pride in you As a symbol of a new Egyptian generation Determined to achieve changes. Egypt is facing difficult times. I'm afraid for the outcome of this situation And that the youth who are calling for change Will be the first to suffer the consequences. We have taken Tahrir Square! <i>The people demand the fall of the regime.</i> The entire nation erupted at once To battle injustice, corruption, poverty, ignorance All that we endured over the past 30 years. We were all equal. Reflections of each other. <i>Freedom</i> <i>Freedom</i> <i>Freedom</i> I swore to God That I wouldn't leave the Square Until our demands were met. I met Magdy Ashour in the Square. Magdy is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. <i>Your bullets won't hurt us.</i> Khalid Abdalla An Egyptian who was born abroad but came back to Egypt never to leave. Aida <i>Freedom is for everyone.</i> Ramy Essam He became known as the singer of the revolution. <i>Bread, freedom, social justice.</i> I swear I'm staying here with you. We found ourselves loving each other without realizing it. Hey guys! We going home? Hell No! We going home? Hell No! <i>Then it's a sit-in</i> <i>Sit-in</i> <i>Until Mubarak leaves</i> There was no such thing as Muslim or Christian. We were all present. We were one hand. <i>One hand!</i> <i>One hand!</i> <i>One hand!</i> We will fill the world with our poetry. Our words will stand in the Square. And they will be like bullets in this war. <i>Revolution until victory!</i> <i>Revolution on ecery street in Egypt!</i> <i>Leave Mubarak!</i> This is when we realized that people are the true power. Every 5 seconds, thousands join the sit-in. We won't leave the Square until our demands are met. We've never had our rights. Finally we have this piece of land to call our own And to claim our rights on. And now, it's ours. It's not too much to ask for. Tahrir Square is nothing Compared to the thousands of acres they stole. Tea anyone? Tea anyone? I told you we'd have some tea together. You too have some tea. If I were to talk on behalf of some of the Islamists Who's to say who's an example of Islam? The ideas we've adopted since the start of the revolution are beautiful The idea that we're one society. To imagine that one day I would be standing in Tahrir Square In solidarity with all these people I could never have imagined it. God be with you. I am telling you good things are coming. Good things. Thank God. <i>Down with Mubarak!</i> <i>Down with Mubarak!</i> <i>Down with Mubarak!</i> President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak Has decided to give up his position as President, Entrusting the Armed Forces With the management of the nation. We all understand The magnitude of his decision. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces Wholeheartedly salutes The revolutionaries who lost their lives. He stepped down! He stepped down! Oh my God! Oh Egypt! Tahrir Square changed Egypt completely. It moved the whole world. For the first time in our lives, we couldn't be silenced. We reclaimed our freedom. And we dreamed that one day All of Egypt would be like Tahrir Square. Revolution Everyone, clap your hands. Let's celebrate <i>We're all one hand</i> <i>And our demands are one</i> <i>A country by the people</i> <i>By the people</i> <i>By the people</i> <i>By the people</i> The mood here is absolutely extraordinary. I think the really interesting thing here For me, is the fact that Mubarak's leaving Is not enough for the people. <i>My homeland, my homeland, my homeland</i> <i>You have my love and my heart.</i> The most beautiful thing about this revolution Is that we were all united. We forgot our political differences and came together. Soon people will realize that they misunderstood the Muslim Brotherhood. Usually the Muslim Brotherhood is our biggest fear. But everyone inside the Square now is different. We are doing this for our children. Even if I die, it's for the future. So now that Mubarak is gone, we have to take control. The main thing is taking the regime down. Whoever is negotiating with them The regime is already down. If you take out people and put people just like them From the same circle, from the same regime Then you didn't take down the regime. You took down the people. No one is going to kill you. I told you before The Army will sacrifice their last drop of blood Before they fire a single bullet on the people. Never. Now please pack your things and go home. When Mubarak stepped down The Armed Forces took over the country's affairs. They swore to God to meet the people's demands. So people went home. And nothing happened. We didn't put the killers on trial or change the government. There is no new constitution, and the Secret Police are still in power. The regime is not just Mubarak. The regime is all the country's institutions, and they all have to change. So we went back to the Square. We're entering Tahrir Square, the place of pride and dignity Where a tent and a blanket can solve all your problems. <i>We'll keep protesting.</i> <i>We'll keep protesting.</i> <i>We're staying here. We're not going anywhere.</i> <i>We're staying here. We're not going anywhere.</i> <i>We'll continue our revolution.</i> <i>We'll continue our revolution.</i> <i>Our revolution is a people's revolution</i> <i>Our revolution is a people's revolution</i> <i>Not a coalition's recolution Nor a party's revolution.</i> <i>Not a coalition's recolution, nor a party's revolution.</i> For the past 3 or 4 days people would come and threaten us. They asked why we are here. We tried to explain to them The biggest mistake we made Was that we left the Square before the power was in our hands. It takes time to convince people to join us. One person joins Then two and three. I find myself giving a speech to 40 or 50 people every two hours. I speak my heart out. People start to understand. Out of 40 or 50 people, 20 agree with me. And the numbers keep getting bigger. It makes me so happy. Oh my God, look how big that pepper is. Look how big the pepper is, now that the age of Mubarak is over. During his rule, the peppers were tiny. Look how big they are now. There is hope for the future. I don't think I look like a thug. You look like a lovely person And you're talking decently. We just need your I.D. - There is still a revolution. - I know. - And there's a sit-in. - Okay. And problems happen inside. And you are being searched by Ramy Essam, The handsome singer of our revolution. It's a great honor. I hope it's you every day. Tell me, what time do you come? We'll wait for you. Every day at 8 am and 4 pm. I look forward to it. Oh man, this is hard. Security takes skill. This is Egypt State Radio. I'm a General and Military Analyst. No, the title of expert is a very big thing. If people have demands, they should submit them to authorities And assign representatives. And they have the media to complain to. If we and the government don't succeed, Then they have the right to criticize. Protests gather people from all walks of life. Was everyone in Tahrir a protester? Some had nothing to do with the protest. Some went to Tahrir to look like heroes. Today, anyone can pretend that they were heroes of the revolution You were in the Square. You know the type Some people went to get stoned, or to steal, or some were thugs. There are three powers: the secular somehow, The Islamist, and the old regime led by the Army. The Army has won part of this revolution. They wanted to stop Mubarak's son from inheriting power. Once that happened, they wanted people to go back home, And the country to go back to its corrupt ways. The Army are the leaders of the counter-revolution. You've already won a lot, and it is threatened. This is a warning. Leave! Go home. If you don't leave, I will shoot you. Egyptians do not revolt easily. For us to revolt, it means we've had enough. Enough! We'll free our country, no matter what. And we'll take down the regime. The people are determined to continue their revolution. Do whatever you want to us We're staying, this is our Square. The people are the source of authority, not the Army. You are saying that it's a peaceful protest. You think you can do whatever you want And we won't attack you. But we will attack if necessary. That's how it is. That's the end of it. You're imposing a curfew? Yes, God willing. You mean just in the Square? No, everywhere. But, Sir Mister, I'm afraid this won't do. But they told us yesterday, We could continue the sit-in in the Square. - Off you go. Leave. - Yes, sir. Why the Square in particular? We took these barricades from the Police, So we'd be able to stop any attack. We do trust the Army. But there are some leaders in the Army Who are corrupt because they are part of Mubarak's era. Everyone's awake. There might be an attack at any time. - What's going on? - I don't know. Guys, the Police and the Army are standing together. Why do you have a camera? I'm a reporter Come here, I want to talk to you. - No - I won't arrest you, I swear No, I'm sorry Calm down <i>Let him go! Let him go! Don't arrest him!</i> Ok, ok. I'm coming with you. Pull down the barricade. So this is our Army! Look at what they are doing! Don't talk shit about the Army! I can't believe this is happening! We need to go back! Just stop it! They can't get away with this shit! Fine. Go back. We left people behind. Can we speak inside, please? Has anyone been killed? There's no news. Tahrir is symbolic land. If you've got control of it, you have power. It pulls people to you. It wasn't on BBC. It wasn't on CNN. It was nowhere. Ramy Essam? Can you call? Tell me the exact names Ramy Essam, the singer. Do you know Ramy Essam? They arrest people and take them to the museum. Be sure of it before you spread the word. Ramy was taken? He got arrested. A lot of people got arrested. They will fuck him up. How can they fucking do this? They threw me to the ground and took my clothes off. And they cut my hair. They beat me in lots of different ways. We have seen terrible injustice from them. This is from electrocution. The blood freezes and clogs. Every two weeks, the Secret Police used to come and take me away. I didn't know if I would ever return. Many of my friends died inside. They used to come in the middle of the night. They used to take you away violently. You were afraid to dream the wrong dream for fear of punishment. They used to search his computer Looking for anything religious or Islamic. They used to come, and no one could say a word. He was electrocuted and beaten. The battle isn't just the rocks and stones The battle is in the images The battle is in the stories. We decided to create a space which supports Those fighting for the revolution Through video and various types of media. It's what's called "Popular Media" Using web sites like YouTube. If you know anyone who has a digital camera They're not using, tell us. We should film as much as we can. The truth is that things are moving quickly. We don't know when this footage can be used as evidence. If people are being fooled about what is really happening here, We must film everything and show them the truth. As long as there's a camera, the revolution will continue. The problem now with the media Is that they oppose change And turn people against the revolution. So what will you do? Well, I am going to keep exposing them. And they'll keep exposing themselves. Until The corrupt media falls. What are you going to do? Start a television station? Yes, hopefully I will. Well you'll have to put it in Cyprus or else they will destroy it. So you'll need a massive amount of money. Yours Because your people are poor. And who is this democracy and freedom for? The poor and under privileged. The rich don't want freedom. They're already free. Revolution means total change. A government accountable to the people. Be patient. Patient for how long? This is what I thought would happen when we left the Square After Mubarak stepped down, We would run the government And run the Army. Look, our biggest mistake was leaving the Square. We're like someone who did really well in an exam And then forgot to write their name on the exam. So you have no idea who it belongs to. WE YOUR EGYPTIAN ARMED FORCES HAVE NOTHING BUT LOVE AND APPRECIATION FOR EGYPT'S BELOVED PEOPLE AND ITS INNOCENT MARTYRS OF THE REVOLUTION We have nothing against nature, grass, or beauty But this is not our Square. This is the Square they're using to manipulate us In order for them to say "We cleaned up the Square for you. " "And beautified it for you" "And did all what you wanted. " Why do you want to ruin what they did? Move away. They are trying to divide us and distract us. Egypt, mother of the world, my country Where laughter and singing comes Purely from the heart. Six months have passed since the day we started the revolution The Armed Forces said they would hand over power in six months. But what have they done instead? They started arresting us day after day. Sent thousands of revolutionaries to military trials. There is no new constitution. There is no law. Nothing to protect us. So we defied Army orders and took back our Square. <i>Wake up</i> <i>Cicil</i> <i>Peaceful</i> <i>Popular</i> <i>Totally Free!</i> <i>Revolution</i> I'm Egyptian, and I'm sitting-in once again in Tahrir Because I didn't feel any change. Why do they send the revolutionaries to military trials While the corrupt old regime is protected? The Square is what united us all. Even if we disagree with each other, We have to be united once again. I'm Ahmed Hassan, your friend, sitting-in with you in Tahrir Square. During the early days, we agreed to stay united no matter what. When we were united we brought down the dictator. How do we succeed now? We succeed by uniting once again. All political currents, the Brotherhood, Muslims and Christians Any party, we're all Egyptians. We have to go back to being united. God give you strength. THE PEOPLE WANT TO CLEANSE THE NATION - I missed you. - I missed you a lot. - How are you? - Good There's a massive turnout today. - But it's a different crowd today. - Meaning? There's a big presence of Muslim Brotherhood. - More than the last week? - For sure. Yes, the Brotherhood wasn't here last week. All the Muslim Brothers were told to be here today. It's been said that the Muslim Brotherhood made a deal with the Army. This is what's being said. Honestly, I'm upset about their political tactics and games. They should not be here for a political agenda or gains. Some Brotherhood leaders make secret deals with the Army And use their presence in the Square as a negotiating tool. You know I think this is wrong. The Quran is our constitution. Islamic rule! Islamic rule! The Muslim Brotherhood started yelling "Islamic rule, Islamic rule" What do they mean by Islamic? Aren't we Muslims too? The Brotherhood began to use the Square to negotiate with the Army. They're not calling for the people's demands. But for their political demands. The Brotherhood ruined the sit-in. They've created divisions amongst everyone in the Square. They are exhausting everyone with their lies. Thank you - What are you going to eat? - I have some. When the Brotherhood are active, people say they are hijacking the revolution. But the Brotherhood existed long before the revolution. But you change your statements based on where you are. In Cairo, you say you a want secular state. In other areas you say you want a religious one. You are the biggest supporters of the Military Council, standing against us. You speak in the name of religion to get what you want. You contradict your statements all the time. Hold on, look at this I'm very sorry that you were beaten in the past. No, not beaten. We've spent our lives in prison cells. The Muslim Brotherhood has damaged the image of Islam. I am embarrassed of being a Muslim because of you. The Brotherhood has hijacked the revolution, turned people against us And the media blames the revolutionaries for destroying the country! The people who died, they died because of you, And your deals with the Military. Weren't the Brotherhood with you in the Square? Yes, there were some who died next to me But they were defying Brotherhood orders. Sir, if you forget, the Egyptian people do not. Don't try to hijack the revolution. Fine, fine, fine The entire Brotherhood is bullshit. Sir, can I ask you a question? Are the Brotherhood leaving the Square? Yes, they're leaving at 5 The Brotherhood refuse to stay in the sit-in, Because you're calling for a new constitution. Let's cut the bullshit. We made a revolution, we demand a new constitution. Laws, elections, judiciary Everything stems from the constitution. Listen, the Brotherhood will never make radical changes Never the radical change we want. I don't want to follow the news of the sit-in anymore. I'm not supporting this sit-in anymore. Especially when you say it's full of Brotherhood and State Security. No, it's not full of them. But it's a place where it's easy to manipulate things. It's obvious that our presence in the Square pressures the Army. As long as you have a daily commitment to the Square, You will keep going Until you get arrested. I'm not happy with the leaders of the Brotherhood. I disagree with their latest statements That we can't go to the Square because it's hurting the economy And it could put the Brotherhood in a bad position. When our leaders issue an order, we don't argue Because we see them as better judges. - They say. - Don't talk about it? No, "You're there as an individual, not as a Muslim Brother. " They repeat this message at each meeting. Do you know what a 'civil state' is? A 'civil state' represents all different parts of society. - Which mainly includes what? - What? The Islamic religion. No matter what, religion will always be there. But it should be official. Religion does not need to be on paper. Religion is in the heart, - And in the mind. - It should also be on paper. Paper, what paper? You need a paper to know you are Muslim? When the Brotherhood got what they wanted from the Military, They left us alone in the Square, to get beaten up, arrested To die alone. Why are you doing this? You motherfucker! Come back, come back! Asshole. Your permit. Your permit. Ok, where's your film? No, you did. Yeah, yeah. Your ID. Open the camera. Show me the camera. I want to see your ID. Don't step outside. Well, this is why we want to get rid of them as soon as possible And to say that people are not ready to vote Is just very condescending and wrong. Yeah, I know you don't agree. You want Parliamentary elections in two months? Yes, I want people to vote. In two months? Yes, yes. Okay, so what? Yet, people are complaining that the Muslim Brotherhood will win. Fuck this. Between the ex-regime as a major power force And the Brotherhood as a major power force I believe that the millions who made this happen, I believe that the majority of them were not people Who wanted the old regime And were not people who wanted the Brotherhood. I am so fucking scared of the moment, a lieutenant or a brigadier general Enough of this. All the politicians are failures. The Muslim Brothers, the Salafis, the Socialists, The Liberals, they're all failures. I've decided to walk in the middle of the street. The cars can do whatever they want. What can they do? Run me over? They need to curb to the side, not me. I will stand my ground. Go away. Enough walking cautiously on the side. After ten months, everything was against us. The Military Council was against us. The Brotherhood sold us out. The media made people hate us. So much so that a peaceful protest In front of the State Media building Could go so wrong. I never imagined this could happen. Why do these people want to enter the state television building? Imagine if someone went in and announced themselves President Hell could break out. Alright? Those soldiers were on duty. Right? A soldier on duty, what is he supposed to do? Who started attacking first? That's the question. Please accept my condolences. Don't cry. Your son is in heaven. We'll continue his fight. We used to sit together in the Square. He used to sing, "Christians and Muslims are one. " Nothing can ever separate us. Thousands will fight for his rights. Mina is in Heaven. Our voices must be heard. All bodies must be examined and evidence must be kept! <i>We want our autopsy reports!</i> The hospital doesn't want to stamp the autopsy reports. We discovered that the Secret Police infiltrated the hospital Trying to convince the families not to do autopsies. We managed to kick them out And the prosecutors left with them. Now we're waiting for the families to make a decision. Whether they do the autopsies or bury the bodies immediately. Without the autopsy evidence, there'll be a big problem. They'll be able to say "Oh, they died in a stampede. " They have to do autopsies. They have to be filmed. Because there are clear marks that they were run over by tanks. They summarized all you wrote And said he died from a bullet in the chest. Stay here. I'll get you the report. For a year we've been in this mess. In this shit, in this country Because of every time we keep silent. We can't stay silent. We have to keep the pressure on. We might not win this time, but maybe next time. People must know they will be punished And be afraid of that. People can't take it anymore. They're losing their nerves. The Egyptian regime was able to fool both Muslims and Christians. They want to suffocate us. If it remains stuck in our minds That it's a sectarian problem, that will be a crisis. The Army wants this to happen. There is an old saying: - "Divide and Conquer" - Exactly. They want to divide Muslims and Christians. Why Mina? Didn't I tell you not to go to protests? "I won't go. I'll do as you say, Mom. " But you tricked me and went And took your life away from me. "If I died a martyr, Mom? Would you be sad for me, Mom?" I'm not sad for the martyr in you. But losing you hurts, my love. I'm not sad for the martyr in you, my love. I'm not sad for the martyr in you, my love. Our parting hurts, Mina. <i>Our Army is firing at us!</i> <i>A new revolution all ocer again!</i> <i>Live free or die heroes!</i> Our Army has protected you! And protected the revolution! The Army didn't protect the revolution. The Army protected their interests But betrayed the revolution! Betrayed the revolution! Protected the revolution! Betrayed the revolution! Betrayed the revolution! The Army betrayed the revolution! So you are right? And all of us are wrong? Betrayed the revolution! It's shocking that however many people died yesterday The whole country isn't in outrage. Is there still a possibility for enough people to be convinced That action en masse can change the future of the country. And if people are stopping to believe that, then As a revolution we're in trouble. <i>Freedom!</i> <i>Freedom!</i> <i>Freedom!</i> <i>Freedom!</i> <i>Freedom!</i> <i>When you're working hard</i> <i>And worried about your country's future</i> <i>When all your work is for nothing</i> <i>Because only the corrupt get ahead</i> <i>Bow, bow, bow your head down</i> <i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i> <i>When freedom of expression is a crime</i> <i>When you have to hide your beliefs in your heart</i> <i>When I can see shame in your eyes</i> <i>Then join your pain with mine</i> <i>Bow, bow, bow your head down</i> <i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i> <i>When the Army is your "protector"</i> <i>While turning its back on the country</i> <i>Abusing their powers</i> <i>Hiding safely behind their uniform</i> <i>Bow, bow, bow your head down</i> <i>Because your country is a "democracy"</i> <i>The people want the fall of the Military regime</i> <i>The people want the fall of the Military regime</i> <i>The people want the fall of the Military regime</i> Khalid! Get in the car. <i>Stand back. Stand back.</i> The Square was tough. The Square was not normal. No one could understand what was happening. It was a war. A war in the Square. Not a revolution. It was not a revolution. <i>The people demand the fall of the Military regime.</i> They were firing live bullets at us. Firing randomly in every corner of the Square. People were falling one by one Just because they were saying "Down with Military rule. " Revolutionaries The good and free people are being called traitors While the traitors are called heroes. It was too much. Too many bullets. Our Army is killing us. They can't be Egyptians! They forgot Egypt! He's alive, he's alive Death always knocks on my door Knocking on my head. The Brotherhood just called me. They said "Don't go to the Square. " I told them "No one is going to stop me from following my conscience" It is your right to banish me from your group, from your party. Banish me and my whole family, But they have no authority over me. The issue is over. They know Magdy is always in the Square. Magdy the revolutionary? Not Magdy the Muslim Brother? Yes, the revolutionary. I want to tell the Brotherhood that the protestors who are sacrificing now Are the only reason they have any voice in this country. Elections or not, our revolution is still not over. Nothing has been accomplished yet. There's only so much you can handle. We're human after all. There's only so much you can see. At some point I'm going to explode. At some point, I'm going to explode. Watch out, watch out! Are you ok? Hey kiddo, are you ok? Ahmed! Ahmed! Let me pass, let me pass Is it a bullet? A bullet? Is it a bullet? Or a rock? Can I have some bandages? Bandages, bandages Why is there all this blood? Why all this blood? They're gassing the hospital and people are dying. Even the doctors are dying. I think it's nerve gas. You collapse and convulse. Did you film any of this? I filmed but then I fell. You couldn't take it? I was shaking and suffocating. Everyone was. The patients have to be moved, or they will die. General Tantawi denied that any live bullets have been fired. Glorious people of Egypt. What we are witnessing now on the streets and television Are just accusations attempting to smear the image of the Military. The Armed Forces will move forward with Parliamentary elections as planned. Presidential elections will take place before the end of June 2012. It's the first time he dares speak to us! Hi Ahmed How did you know it was me? Of course honey, you're my sweetheart. So quickly you said "Hello Ahmed. " How are you doing? I'm fine, thank God. I prepared dinner for you. Thank you. I'll come home now. Okay Good-bye I can't tell my mother I'm injured. It will make her worry. And while we were dying in the street The Brotherhood had already made a deal with the Military. They won the Parliamentary elections And started preparing for Presidential elections. The Brotherhood are here to celebrate And we're here to continue the revolution. <i>"We're preparing, in God's name"</i> <i>"To fight the final battle"</i> The Muslim Brotherhood buys poor people with oil and sugar. They mobilize people using religion. We've accomplished huge gains. It's a big leap forward that we've taken Parliament. This is the will of the people, the will of the nation. The Brotherhood made this revolution. Listen Sir, this was never about the Brotherhood or the Islamists. This revolution was made by everyday people taking to the streets And the Brotherhood was not there at the beginning. I'm tired of arguing about this. The problem is that we don't tolerate each other. You left us to die in order to take Parliament. All the people who died were because of your betrayals. The Muslim Brotherhood You shook hands with the Military and betrayed us. - Just like this. - So what? - It's our right. - It's your right! I will not respond to this. It's our right. The Brotherhood has the right to ally itself with the Military? The same Military that killed its own people? Talk some sense into your Brotherhood friend. He's saying the Brotherhood must cooperate with the Military. Talk some sense into him. You can have the Square and do whatever you want The revolution is coming no matter what. What do you think? They've come to dance. Who is dancing? I understand what Ahmed is saying. Some are dancing While some are getting screwed. And we've been destined to be the ones getting screwed. The revolution in two words? A revolution that removed a regime, ok? Before the people destroyed it. Did the Army protect the revolution? We didn't protect the revolution, we made it happen. You kids don't know anything. I was beaten with boots and sticks. I'm bruised from being beaten all over my body. I've lived in the military world for 40 years. I am honestly telling you The Armed Forces are not like this. At all You've been entrusted with a nation's security. It's your duty. So, all I'm asking is How can I entrust a nation to those who can't even protect a woman? Even if I am your brother At some point, I must be tough on you. I don't understand why. Why? When the Army first came to the streets people climbed on tanks And hugged the soldiers and clapped for them. What then? Why? What's wrong with you? I swear to you Ghada, one day you'll say you met General Hamdy Bekheit And he told you the following None of the guilty will get away with it. Whatever happens. I promise you. This is a picture of a friend who took a bullet in his leg. This is not an Army bullet. It doesn't look like one. The most beautiful thing about our Square Is that everyone who comes here follows his conscience, Not some political force. And that's what makes us strong. We're here presenting Cinema Tahrir To remind us why we are here And to show the people who ask us why we're still here. Because only we can tell our stories. The revolutionaries who toppled the regime Have died, been injured, or gone to prison. And with no constitution, They want to hold elections stained by revolutionary blood. Supervised by those who killed the revolutionaries. And they made two ballot boxes One for the killer, and one for the traitor. Our voices will keep getting higher and higher, Because the streets are our ballot boxes. I don't want either. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. We'll have to accept whatever happens. Everyone keep your voices down. With 51.73% 13 million, 230 thousand and 131 Listen up The winner of the Egyptian Presidential elections Is Dr. Mohamed Morsi <i>Morsi!</i> Some people are afraid, but they should give Morsi a chance. If I were the president, I'd tell the people to give us one chance. If Morsi isn't able to prove himself, he should leave power. Just give him 100 days. We waited 30 years for this. Give him 100 days. It's still your revolution. It was the worst day of my life The day the Muslim Brotherhood took over. They were the first ones to betray us. And now they're ruling the country. They were the only unified group in the Square. They have a leader telling them what to do. They are highly organized. Our main problem as revolutionaries Most of the time, we only object and say "No" And we never suggest alternatives. Politics is not the same as a revolution. If you want to play politics, you have to compromise. And we're not good at this, at all. - We're terrible at it. - We don't know how to compromise. We're not organized. Even strategically, it was obvious who the real players are It was either the old regime, or the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood wanted Parliament, and they took it. They wanted the upper house, and they took it. Now they took the presidency. - What else is left? - Nothing. Then this is the end of the Brotherhood. How so? That's ridiculous. They're controlling everything now. How can you say we will topple the Brotherhood? The more they control, the more people will hate them. The street is our only way. After 150 days of Muslim Brotherhood rule, We found that Mohamed Morsi, who had promised to achieve the revolution's demands, Was bowing to the demands of the Brotherhood Supreme Leader. He tailored the constitution to the Muslim Brotherhood And gave himself privileges that even Mubarak didn't have. Mohamed Morsi is not a God. Mohamed Morsi is an Egyptian who was elected by 51% of the vote. Morsi and the Brotherhood abused democracy. The Brotherhood creature Has no place in the Square. We made this revolution. Why is he hijacking this Square? If we see a Muslim Brother coming to the Square This idea of a ruling Pharaoh still controlling us Needs to be broken. The Brotherhood stole the revolution During these past months of Morsi's rule, We have the same problems. It's crazy, we made a revolution and no new constitution. We got a president without a constitution. The most important thing is the new constitution And now it's under their control. Religion is the biggest problem we will face in this next phase Because we have a new political power That also claims it's a religious organization, A missionary force, And this is a disaster. Magdy, I love you. But I hate the Brotherhood. They made shitty decisions, and we're in a shitty situation. You elected a president. You need to be patient. For how long? The President is a man who I trust with my religion. Can't I trust him with my politics too? This is the constitution of the Brotherhood. We are Egyptian citizens. We are not Brotherhood citizens. You were against torture, and now you're torturing. Against corruption, and now you're corrupt. Who brought Morsi into power? The people. Because they felt you guys were an oppressed people. This document will allow what happened to you to happen to me. Do you accept that? Of course not. OK, then take this constitution. It doesn't serve me. I hated what they did to you. I went to the streets because of it. Why did we go to the street? Wasn't it to protest against Police brutality? The Secret Police that tortured you? You are allowing the Secret Police to do the same thing to me. And you're saying "yes" to this. <i>The people demand the fall of the regime.</i> This is the third stage of our revolution. We got rid of Mubarak, then the Military Now the focus is on the Brotherhood. It is a bigger challenge, because it will include more blood. When you're fighting your own people, it's different from fighting the regime. Because, after all, even if the regime was extremely violent and vicious And if they used all the weapons they had, It's still not as vicious as when the people fight each other. It's very different. In the name of God, I am directing this to the people Who have resorted to violence. The time has come for the law To judge them and punish them. He's ordering his people to attack us. That's the message behind his speech. Go to the streets and attack the hell out of them. The Brotherhood has been fucking with us for two years. You go to the toilet, And they slip in 40 new articles into the constitution. It's crazy. What's happening here is what happened in Iran. Soon enough, they will wipe us out, and all their opposition. Did you get orders to go to the streets, or not? I was in the streets. You were there? - I went. - You were involved in events? Yeah. With some friends. During the fighting? - Yes during the fight. - At the Palace itself? To remove the tents? You were throwing rocks on me Assem? Throwing rocks at me. Come on. Let me show you this video. <i>What happened is a crime against protestors</i> <i>Committed by the Muslim Brotherhood.</i> <i>They tore their tents apart</i> <i>Why attack peaceful protestors?</i> Oh God. <i>"We'll butcher you, if you don't confess you're with the liberals"</i> - They used weapons? - Yes How can a president bring his people to attack protestors and destroy their sit-in? <i>Morsi, Morsi!</i> I was upset that Assem went to the Palace. Who were you standing against? Khalid? Pierre? I was standing against them? What did you think? You know that one phone call from the Brotherhood and we're all in the streets, right? If they tell us to go to Tahrir it's an order, right? I would never be proud of standing with the Brotherhood to attack others. When this revolution started I told you that it was for you. For your sister and brother. For you to write history. You have to stand as an individual. You can think for yourself. With all due respect to you and the Brotherhood And other Islamists Or any other groups You have a brain. You can think for yourself. We have to ask ourselves "Who created this situation?" Did the revolution create it? No. The person in charge created this. The dictator who has given himself dictatorial powers. Who's ready to kill us To force what he wants and pass this constitution To have complete and total power For eternity. I didn't see you today at all. What did Morsi do wrong? No one has given him a chance. My butcher the other day yelled "God Damn you, Morsi" I asked why. He said "Because it is so hot. " Is this a joke? If there were alternatives, I wouldn't want Morsi Honestly, we don't care about Mubarak or Morsi. We just want a decent man to rule with justice. I don't care if he's a Jew. We're afraid that if Morsi falls, we will be taken back to prisons. Why all the focus on the Brotherhood and how horrible the President is? The revolutionaries were your friends. You lived with them. - There is a fog in the country. - No, Magdy You abandoned one side and chose the other. I didn't abandon I chose the side that I grew up with, that I felt was supporting me. Magdy has five children. How does he provide for them? The Muslim Brotherhood. All the time Magdy was playing revolutionary, being filmed, shot at, jailed What did he gain? Where did that get him? I never thought we'd all be divided Into the Brotherhood and other groups. I'm sad. Nothing has changed for my dad. We haven't gained from the revolution. I still can't get health care. It's okay. It's okay. These are the gains of the revolution She's filled with tears. It's okay. Everything will be alright. Our beloved President May God make June 30th a day of pride for Islam And a day of doom for the hypocrite opposition. May you destroy them all. - Defeat them and make us win. - Amen. - Protect us from their evils. - Amen. President Morsi is a line you don't cross. Meaning? Meaning, if you threaten him, we'll spill your blood. Meaning? Meaning, he's the legitimate elected President But they're going to the streets to take him down. They can go to hell. Why? It's their right. No, It's not their right. <i>Freedom</i> <i>Freedom</i> What is revolution? Revolution is not simply replacing a regime. Revolution is a culture of a people. You give them ownership of their freedom. That's what we gained. We were able to introduce the culture of protesting. Now they can oppose the ruler whoever they are. If we predict what's next, the Army is coming The Army will return, let's not fool each other. But do you think the Army will act in the same way it did? Do you think so? <i>Muslims and Christians are one hand.</i> Now the power is in the hands of the people. Whoever comes next The people will continue to pull rulers out of power Until people reclaim their rights And we build the country ourselves. Isn't that right? <i>The people demand the fall of the regime</i> <i>The people demand the fall of the regime</i> <i>The people demand the fall of the regime</i> I told the Brotherhood once, take the Square, Do what you want But the revolution is coming despite anyone. Millions and millions of people took to the streets To tell him "Leave" Millions more than those who protested against Mubarak, Protested against Morsi. This is the revolution's achievement. Because our revolution's weapon is our voice. For it to sound in every home. If you ask me "What is the revolution's biggest victory?" It's that kids today play a game called "Protest" Where some kids are playing the revolutionaries, And others play Police or Army or Muslim Brothers. <i>"The people demand the fall of the regime"</i> <i>"The people demand chocolate for kids"</i> Children of Egypt, People of Egypt everywhere, Standing in Egypt's squares and streets, If the price to protect my legitimacy is my own blood, Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply - Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply - Cheaply For the sake of this nation For God almighty. Morsi is digging his own grave with his words. I'm going down to the Square. I'm on my way. Of course, there are weapons in the Brotherhood sit-in. Aren't those in the Brotherhood sit-in in grave danger? We're not going to run away, so some came with weapons. Some people think "Kill those who are coming to kill you" I hope nothing bad happens. <i>Power</i> <i>Determination</i> <i>Faith</i> <i>Morsi, Morsi</i> <i>God is great</i> You don't want to see your friends, Khalid and Ahmed? I want to see them, But I'm assigned here now. They told me I need to stay. I don't want to stand with one side against the other, And it could result in death. Understand? Aren't you sad? Of course That your friends are on the opposite side? Who am I attacking? Am I going to attack Khalid Abdalla? Or Pierre who used to host me in his apartment? The President's speech was not satisfactory to the people's demands. Early presidential elections will be held. The head of the constitutional court will be the interim President Until a new president is elected. <i>Long live Egypt!</i> <i>Long live Egypt!</i> Morsi has fallen. So did the Army and Mubarak. We're waiting for the next one. This is our life now, we'll stay in the street. I want to go home and sleep. So tell me Magdy, what are we going to do now? Listen Ahmed, I swear to God, I'm at the Brotherhood sit-in. We may or may not be massacred. It doesn't matter. If you're meant to die, it's going to happen wherever you are. The more they kill, the more we believe in our cause. The pro-Morsi sit-in declared that there have been deaths After they were shot at with live bullets. A massacre by all means. Magdy, as much as I've been violent in words That was just anger speaking. Well, you're putting our religion on the line. You're challenging our belief of an Islamic country. Honestly, I want to come be with you. After all, this revolution was for a principle, not for blood. What I feared has started happening That we're going to fight each other. <i>We're all your soldiers. Morsi!</i> <i>We'll rally beside you. Morsi!</i> <i>We'll rally beside you. Morsi!</i> I don't want you to get hurt or killed. Magdy when I gave you a hard time it was because I was mad. But we still respect each other's opinions. And you and I agree We want the best for our country. You shouldn't come here. - You shouldn't come here. - No, forget it I'm coming. What will they do? Kill me? That's up to God's will. And if I die I'll just blame it on you, Magdy. You know me. I'm not here to die or to kill. You know my intentions. I swear, I know that Magdy May God stop the blood. We've had enough. Please just take care of yourself, Magdy. May peace be with you. The leaders play on top, and the people are on the bottom dying. The people pay the price for everything. The people always pay the price. A Muslim Brother, a Salafi, a Revolutionary, a Secular, a Christian or a Muslim, they're all Egyptians. Egyptians are paying the price. The toughest time of my life was When I was sleeping in my home amongst my family And my children. I would open my eyes and find Secret Police all around me Inside my bedroom. Is this a life? Is this a life? One day you'll call my son And my son might not answer you. His mother will tell you that Magdy is dead and so is his son. Or put in jail. I would prefer death. Prison is hard. Very hard. I have aged, but it was trying to achieve my dreams. We thought the revolution had succeeded. Not really. It's not even close. We won't know if this revolution has succeeded For decades. There is no way in which the goals of this revolution: Bread, Freedom, Social Justice, Dignity There is no way in which those things can be achieved In two years. What you can do is lay the ground for them to actually happen. Because when you don't have your rights, When you're taken for granted, When you're lied to, when you're killed Things become pretty clear. I think what's happening is more powerful than any one individual and than any organization. It's something fundamental inside people that is moving them. I don't know how you kill that. We're not looking for a leader as much as we're looking for a conscience. What is a leader anyway? Are they going to offer solutions from the heavens? They won't do that. The thing is, if we are able to create this conscience within the society, We'll be able to find a good president. We are not looking for a leader to rule us. Because everyone who went to Tahrir is a leader. We are looking for a conscience. <i>Freedom is coming, that's for sure</i> <i>"Liberty" was written in our destiny</i> <i>They said, riots are in our blood</i> <i>And how dare we claim our rights?</i> <i>Freedom</i> <i>Revolution!</i> Oh, the Square Where were you long ago? With you we sung and with you we suffered We've prayed and we've been scared United day and night Nothing is impossible with you The sound of freedom is gathering us And our lives finally have meaning No turning back Our voices are finally heard And the dream is no longer forbidden Oh, the Square Where were you long ago? You've destroyed the walls and let in the light You gathered the broken people around you We've been reborn And our determined dream was born We have our differences, but our intentions are pure Even when the picture wasn't clear Honoring our country and our grandchildren And the rights that have been stolen from our youth Oh, the Square Where were you long ago? With you we felt something for the first time But since then we grew apart We have to change ourselves with our own hands You gave us so much, and now it's our turn Sometimes I fear that you become a memory We grow apart and the whole idea fades away That we forget everything that has happened And you become only a story to be told Oh, the Square Where were you long ago? Our idea is our strength Our unity is our weapon Oh, the square Where were you long ago? What do you want, Rocco? What we all want. To not die young, poor or alone. Manny. These guys, they. I don't give them what they're after, they'll kill me. Hold it, Rocco. We don't fight these guys. Sure, maybe you get that. - Shit. God damn it. - Cut! - Props! - Cut. Sorry, everyone. - We're going again, Eddie. - I don't know what happened. Sorry, Sam. Of course, the one day the author is among us. Among us. Sure as hell ain't one of us. What's my brilliant line, Trumbo? Oh! I've got it right here. "Hold it, Rocco. Now if. If we don't fight these guys, "sure, maybe you get that long, happy life we all want." So, what do you got me fighting for then? Well, peace on Earth. Good will toward men. Well, you can't do that. This is America. All right. How about sex and money? There you go. Two things we all love. Well. One of your little sermons on citizenship. All right, going again. Mayer lined up the A Team. Sam Wood to shoot, Dalton Trumbo for rewrites. I had no crew, I couldn't work. So, good, fingers crossed You wouldn't work. God forbid you cross a picket line for set builders. What the hell do set builders have to do with writing? What writers write, builders build. What they build, you shoot. Now, you make all the money you possibly can. So do I. Why shouldn't they? And why can't we help them? Listen to you, the swimming pool Soviet. Oh, for God's sakes, you won! Sam, the strike is over. And you just might try being a gracious winner! You know, it's never over with you people! Strike after strike after strike! "You people"? Whatever it takes to seek justice! Hey, you know what? - We've all. - Laugh it up. - Why don't we all take six months off? - Oh, come on, Sam! - I'm gonna go on strike. - Good for you. .against people who go on strike. Sam, Sam. And I won't cross your picket line either. Oh, give me that, Trumbo! You're just. - Sam! Sam! - You know what? You know what? I've spent a hell of a long time. What? You're not helping. Eddie. Sam, Sam. We gotta talk about those scenes tomorrow. Disaster. Who the hell wrote that crap? But, uh, first. - Whoa, whoa! - May I have this dance? Eddie. You're spilling my drink. Having fun? Eternally. Miss Hopper. Dateline, Hollywood. The offices of top columnist Hedda Hopper. Greetings from our film capital, where all is sun and fun. Or is it? You see the famous faces here? Danny Kaye, Humphrey Bogart, his dishy bride Lauren Bacall. All of whom have declared solidarity with film crews picketing for higher wages in walkouts that quickly turned violent. Because these strikes were, in fact, the work of dangerous radicals. Here, we see actor Edward G. Robinson, star of Double Indemnity. And this is writer Dalton Trumbo, who is, like many of those strikers and their supporters, a registered communist. Who exactly is behind these walkouts? You actually create something. - And why? - .and they reap all the profits. Now, is that fair? - No! - No! Our elected leaders will find out. Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and his House Un-American Activities Committee. Communism is not some faraway threat. Its most dangerous agents are here, controlling the airwaves and movie screens. Taking over its employees and their unions. They need to be identified as the enemies they are. Communists, their goal: world domination. The frontline of a new kind of war. A cold war. A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values and bring about the overthrow of this nation. Mitzi fell asleep. Hey! That you in the news reel? Yes, it was. Traitor. Oh, my God! Honey. No, I'm all right, I'm all right. No harm done. Are you sure? Oh. Come on. Let's go. - Dad? - Mmm. Are you a communist? I am. Is that against the law? It is not. The lady with the big hat said you were a dangerous radical. Are you? Radical? Maybe. Dangerous. Only to men who fling Cokes. I love our country. And it's a good government. But anything good could be better, don't you think? Is Mom a communist? No. Am I? Well, why don't we give you the official test? Mom makes your favorite lunch. Ham and cheese. Ham and cheese. And at school, you see someone with no lunch at all. What do you do? Share. Share? Well, you don't tell them to just go get a job? No. Oh. You offer them a loan at 6%. Oh, that's very clever. Dad. Ah, then you just ignore them. No. Well, well. You little commie. Trumbo, as usual, you only make sense to you. Now, let them call you a communist, me a Democrat. They're both legitimate parties. Yours is just meaner and duller, but there's nothing illegal about any of it. - Yet. - Hunter. Tell your friend to dial down the paranoia and have a drink. I don't think he's being paranoid enough. Not you too. You're out of ice. Now, I have taken the liberty of drawing up a pamphlet. The subject: Congress unaware of a little thing called the First Amendment. They're aware of it. They just don't give a shit. All they care about is this nice new war of theirs. These guys love war and this is a great one, 'cause it's vague and it's scary and it's expensive. Anybody for it is a hero and anybody against it is a traitor. Exactly, thank you. Arlen, not near the paintings. And if you think this is about the movies, you're an idiot. Which is why I'm going to have a little chat with the other side. You don't mean the Alliance, do you? I do. Are you out of your mind? Eddie, they're all actors and writers and directors, just like us. They're Nazis. They're just too cheap to buy the uniforms. They invited Congress out here. And are they all Sam Woods and Hedda Hoppers? Please, let's not demonize people we don't really know. I say we go for it. And you know who you're gonna be talking to there, don't you? Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Wayne. I wanna say one thing about a place I love. No, not Hollywood. I like Hollywood, but I love America. And when we talk about America, I'm talking about freedom. The kind of freedom we just fought a world war to save. You want to be a communist? Go be a communist. But some friends of mine in Washington think you got some questions to answer. I never knew he was this good. You still want to be a commie. - 'Cause he's not acting. That's him. - .go be one in Russia. But off you go and enjoy the Bolshoi Ballet. Excuse me, sir, would you like to read about the First Amendment? - Sir, a little education. - You know your rights? Pamphlet on the First Amendment. - A little light reading. - Travels well. Well, thank you, Sam. Do svidanya. It costs money to print those. How'd you like to learn about the First Amendment? This is a nightmare. Dalton. Oh, Hedda. Good evening to you. Eddie, darling! Hedda. New hat. Ah, daily, darling, daily. Been to the movies lately, Dalton? Duke. Now, wasn't he magnificent? Just saying what needs saying. Hi, Eddie. Duke. I hear you and your pals got a pamphlet. - Any takers? - Not yet. Uh, would you like one, sir? We're communists. He's a writer. You won't get any takers. Not here, anyway. Oh, why is that? All it says is that Congress has no right to investigate how we vote or where we pray, what we think, say or how we make movies. Hello, I'm Dalton Trumbo. Congress has the right to go after anything they think is a threat. Well, that's where we disagree and that's the point. We both have the right to be wrong. You wanna talk about rights, first tell me whose side you're on. Russia's no friend, not anymore. You'd better wake up. 'Cause it's a new day. A new day! And? And maybe it's not for your kind. My kind? What kind is that? The kind that has no idea why we just won a war. It's curious, that's the second time you mentioned that. See, I was a war correspondent in Okinawa. Hedda's son was stationed in the Philippines. Eddie was in Europe with the Office of War Information. Where did you serve again? You trying to say something? No, Duke, he wasn't. Stay out of it, Eddie. If you're going to talk about World War II as if you personally won it, let's be clear where you were stationed. On a film set, shooting blanks, wearing makeup. And if you're going to hit me, I would like to take off my glasses. Duke, come on. Let's get out of here. Thank you, Dalton. My next column just wrote itself. It's a good thing you didn't want to demonize anybody or else that could have been awkward. Manny wouldn't say "amorous." Hang on one second. Paul, two packs, please. - Here you are. - Thank you. Here you go. Good God, she's everywhere. Your next deal's gonna make you the highest-paid writer in Hollywood. Which will make you the highest-paid writer in the world. You earned it. You don't just write happy endings, you actually believe them. That's what people pay to see. That's why you belong here at MGM. Right, L.B.? I hate to make the wooing too easy for you, but where do I sign? Just one thing. If you're gonna work for me, I never, ever want to see anything like this again. You won't. I promise. Good. Just stop reading Hedda Hopper. So, what did L.B. say then? Jesus, don't. I haven't eaten since. My job's not hard enough? Your job is not hard at all. You think getting Mayer to sign you after those headlines was easy? You have a record-breaking three-year contract to make shit up. You're welcome. Oh, honey, not now. Please, Mom? She really can. - Ask her! - Can what? Cleo, is this true? Watch this. - Trumbo. - Come on. Of course, you realize this means war. Behold! I had a very unusual mother. stage mother. The misspent youth of a child acrobat. My God, how long were you in show business? Till I was 15, but it was more show forced-labor. - Bravo! - Brilliant! Mr. Dalton Trumbo? Yes? I'll see you in Washington. Enjoy your picnic. Let's go, boys. Yes, Mr. Stripling, sir. Nineteen subpoenas have been issued to those we believe have knowledge of the ongoing communist threat in Hollywood. What kind of threat is that? A conspiracy to corrupt democratic values and bring about the overthrow of this nation. Using movies? Any movie in particular or. Movies are the most powerful influence ever created. And they are infested with hidden traitors. The House Un-American Activities Committee has been formed to investigate alleged communists working in Hollywood. The newsreel cameras and an army of newspapermen are on hand. Mr. Reagan, has it been reported to you that certain members of the Screen Actors Guild are communists? There has been a small group more or less following the tactics that we, uh, associate with the Communist Party. And would you refer to them as a disrupting influence? I would say that, at times, they have attempted to be a disruptive influence. Do you believe that the motion picture industry is doing everything it can to rid itself of subversive un-American influences? No. The communists are everywhere. They report directly to Moscow. On numerous occasions, communist agitators have tried hard to steer us into the red river. We had a little too much weight for that. Will you name a few of these agitators? Well, Irving Pichel, Edward Dmytryk, Frank Tuttle. If I had my way about it, they'd all be sent back to Russia or some other unpleasant place. We get our chance to testify in three days. And what we're about to do won't make us too popular. Okay, so we get slandered and then what? You answer every question they ask in your own way. So, don't tell them shit. Beautifully put. Well, you know what they call that? Yes. In all likelihood, we'll be cited for contempt of Congress. There will be a trial. What am I missing here? All I'm hearing is jail. Not necessarily. In a lower court, yes, we'll most likely lose. - But on appeal. - It'll work. The Supreme Court is a five-to-four liberal majority. They think this committee is unconstitutional. They want it killed. Sounds great. I'm out. Niki. Look, I can't afford this stuff you guys are talking about. The Supreme Court and legal fees. You know, Dorothy's not gonna. I mean, things already aren't great, but you know. If I dump all my savings into that, she's gone with the kids. I'll cover you. Expenses, travel, legal fees, everything. You don't even like me. I like you fine. You don't like me. No, you know what it is? I don't trust you. Well, I'd say go on, but I'm afraid you will. Look, I know what I am. Okay? I want this whole country to be different, top to bottom. If I get what I want, nobody gets their own lake. Well, that would be a very dull life, don't you think? Yeah, for you. Not for the guys who built this. If I'm wrong, tell me, but ever since I've known you, you talk like a radical. But you live like a rich guy. That is true. Well, I don't know that you're. I don't think you're willing to lose all of this just to do the right thing. Well, I despise martyrdom and I won't fight for a lost cause. So you're right. I'm not willing to lose it all. Certainly not them. But I am willing to risk it all. That's where the radical and the rich guy make a perfect combination. The radical may fight with the purity of Jesus. But the rich guy wins with the cunning of Satan. Oh, shit. What? Just please shut up. Please. I'll do whatever you want. Just please don't say shit like that anymore. I can't guarantee that. In Washington, 10 of the original 19 subpoenaed began their testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help you God? I do. Sit down, please. Mr. Trumbo, now I shall ask you a series of various questions all of which can be answered with a yes or a no. Well, I shall answer yes or no if I please to answer. I shall answer in my own words. Many questions can be answered yes or no only by a moron or a slave. That's enough! Are you refusing to answer the question? Mr. Chairman, I will refuse to answer none of your questions. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? May I introduce to evidence. No. No! You are out of order! - .my work, my screenplays. - No, no, no, no, no, no. .by which you are making this determination? No, the chair will rule. - It's critical to. - No, just a minute. Your screenplays are too long. I've heard that before. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? Am I accused of a crime? You're not asking the questions. If so, I believe I have the right to be confronted with any evidence that supports this question. Are you refusing to answer the. I should very much like to see what you have. Oh, you would? You will see very soon! Good! The witness is excused. You believe this committee has the right to compel testimony. You are dismissed, sir! Witness is dismissed! To indict opinion, to criminalize thought. Guard, take him out! .but that right does not exist, sir! Order! And the moment it does, God help us all! This is typical communist tactic! This is the beginning of an American concentration camp! Order! Uh, state your name, please. Arlen Hird. I'm a screenwriter. You understand, sir, that if you don't answer my questions, I can hold you in contempt of Congress? I didn't refuse yet, did I? Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? Well, I'd like to answer you, Congressman, but I need to consult with my physician. - Your physician? - Yes. I don't understand. To find out if he can surgically remove my conscience. This is a hostile witness. This is typical communist tactics. Arlen. Arlen, what is it? It's cancer. What? Jesus. How long have you known? - Three months. - Months? Mmm-hmm. Are you receiving treatment? Uh, I don't like the options. It's lung cancer. Bad if you operate, bad if you don't. Well, is there anything I can do for you? No! No, it's cancer. Yeah, but. Jesus. You want to do something? Make sure this plan works. I'm out of options. We were so young. We thought we knew everything. We did. No, not me. No, I didn't realize how much I loved it all until I reached a certain age, and the roles started drying up. I remember thinking, "Now what do you do "when you love something but it stops loving you back?" You fight. No, no, no. You love it more until it surrenders. Hedda, you never left MGM or my heart. How's your boy? Fine. Fine. Still in the navy? Yes, he's First Lieutenant. You raised a real hero. Which is why I would like to tell him that we are doing as much for this country as he is. It's complicated. Trumbo, the others, all have contracts. Oh, L.B., you helped build this business as did I. We're not gonna watch these pissants defile it. I'm running a studio here, Hedda. You think I love every person on my payroll? Grow up. Then how about I make it crystal clear to my 35 million readers exactly who runs Hollywood and won't fire these traitors? How about I name names? Real names. Jacob Warner, Jack Warner. Schmuel Gelbfisz, Sam Goldwyn. And of course, yours. Lazar Meir. You watch what you say to me! Forty years ago, you were starving in some shtetl. The greatest country on Earth takes you in, gives you wealth, power. But the second we need you, you do nothing. And that's exactly what my readers expect from a business run by kikes. Get out! You know, L.B., I am fond of you. Some of my happiest years were spent on this lot. Not in your office, of course. You were always trying to fuck me on the couch. Me, trying to maintain my virtue. Barely. But times change. Now I'd happily fuck you. All studios unanimously agree to discharge the Hollywood Ten without compensation, effective immediately. No studio will ever employ a member of the Communist Party or anyone refusing to cooperate in our struggle with this terrible new menace. He's been loved by film fans for almost 20 years. But have you noticed he hasn't been on-screen much lately? Bad box office? No. Bad politics. Bad news indeed for Mr. Edward G. Robinson. Thank you so much for coming. The Hollywood Ten are going to court for all of us. It'll be long, expensive, so please give as much as you can to the defense fund. Thank you for coming. - Good night, my dear. - Good luck. - Good night, sir. Thank you. - Bye-bye. Well, this little gathering didn't quite have the zip and zing of yesteryear, did it? Where are all the liberals all of a sudden? At their lawyers' or psychiatrists'. Hmm, likely both. For the defense fund. Eddie. Have you been working? Eh. It's a bit slow. You sold one. Oh, the van Gogh. Got a good price. Eddie. Dear God, look at this. Eddie, I can't let you do. I'll be fine, kid, take it. No, it's too much. It's just too much. Take it. Eddie, I. Everything that you have. What he's trying to say is that he loves you. I love him too, the warty son of a bitch. Got a great offer on the Monet if you want to bribe the jury. In the matter of the United States v. Dalton Trumbo, we find the defendant guilty of contempt of Congress. Mr. Trumbo! Mr. Trumbo! I'll meet you in the car. Mr. Trumbo, are you in contempt of Congress? Well, I have total contempt of this Congress. I just thought the jury would see why. The Supreme Court will drop kick this verdict into speeding traffic and end the most shameful chapter in Congressional history. Now, that's it, boys. We have nothing else. No, we're done, we're done. How are you doing for money? Broke as a bankrupt's bastard. Why? Well, you owe me $30,000, and this appeal's gonna be twice that. Well, I'd better get to work. Doing what? You have no talent to do anything else. Hollywood fights back! This is Gregory Peck. A state of near hysteria over so-called communists in this country threatens the freedom of other citizens. So the Un-American Committee bears its tragic fruit. This is Lucille Ball. All of us agree that the Constitution of the United States must be defended. But the way to do this is not by shutting up the man you disagree with. You must fight for his right to speak and be heard. All civil liberties go hand in hand. And when one goes, the others are weakened. Just as a collapse of one pillar in a house would endanger the whole structure. We'll send you home in a couple of days. Well, it sounds like you're going to live. Yeah, they got me just well enough to go to prison. How do you feel? Breathing with one lung, which is half as good as two. Look, Arlen, I heard about Dorothy. Yeah, she took off. Her timing was always amazing. I'm sorry. No, well, I know. I mean, how could you leave all this? How's it going out there? Everyone envies you. Well, why wouldn't they? I got the best room in the joint. You should know. You paid for it. - Congratulations, Buddy. - Thank you, fellas. Who needs the studios? I am strictly independent. Got cans of film, wads of Wall Street dough, and my favorite boss, me. - Cheers. - Cheers. And you, you crazy son of a bitch, you're gonna write all of my movies once this Washington crap clears up. And how will that happen? I'm not political, thank Jesus. If they called me in, accused me, I'd just say, "Yup, did it. Sorry, didn't mean it." So Congress then asks, "Are you now or have you ever been a Democrat?" I am and, God, I just feel awful about it. Then they want the names of other Democrats. Bill and Earl, Nate, Tom. Then I say, "Go to hell." Really? How many banks fund enemies of the state? Your money's gone unless you give the names of your friends here. They'll never work again, but it's the only way you ever will. We all know each other, our families. We're friends. What would you do, Buddy? Only you. Piss on the best day of a guy's life. Only you! Christ's sakes. According to the protocol set forth. And what does she say? What does the princess say? Shit. Shit! Shouldn't be any likeness. It concerns me a little bit. Oh, good morning, Nikola. I thought you weren't allowed to write anymore. Ah. No. No, just not allowed to put my name on it, or get paid. How does that work? Not very well. It's funny. It's breezy and romantic. Who wrote it? You did, old boy. You stick your name on my labor, hand it in to your studio and we're in business. Look, it is just dumb luck that I wasn't subpoenaed and blacklisted myself. The hearings are going to start up again soon. I'm going to get called and canned. Well, then quick, lad. Let's sell this little beauty and split the take, 50-50. Ridiculous. I'll take 10%. You'll take 20. No, 30! And that's my final offer. You're the worst businessman ever. Mmm. I hate the title. Me too. Really? What's wrong with it? - The Princess and the Peasant. - Yes. God, please, Trumbo, it sounds like a puppet show. Well, then, change it. I did. Really? You think this title's better? Roman Holiday. I like it. Who invited you? I did. She's my favorite Trumbo. I'm introducing legislation so in the event of a national emergency, all communists will be sent to internment camps. And the president supports this? He better. Parnell, I need to speak to you privately about your employees. Excuse me, gentlemen. As I said, Bob, these are legitimate salaried employees from my home state. What you didn't tell me is that every one of them is a relative. Which is completely legal. Except that none of them pay taxes. Don't say anything else without a lawyer. - No. - Mrs. Trumbo. Mrs. Trumbo! Hi. Jeff. Ma'am, I gotta get paid. Oh. I'm so sorry. I got men with families. My husband hasn't been able to get any work. We owe everyone. - Ma'am, please. - I'm so. Cleo, we're rich! There you are, Jeffrey. You people sure live exciting lives. Well, I thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Betty! We did it, Cleo! We sold Roman Holiday! Paramount. Our beloved Ian is just. Why, what's the matter? Judge Rutledge died. No, no, that was Judge Murphy who died last month. And Rutledge. Last night. Mmm. Oh, now. Everything will be all right. You'll see. Without a liberal majority on the court, our appeal's gonna be denied. Meaning we should all be prepared to go to prison. I wouldn't change anything going back. Not one thing. Let's ask each other in a year. Will you do me a favor? Hold on to this while I'm gone. Thank you, dear. Your mother needs to laugh at least once a day. Deal? Okay. Where's that little pumpkin seed? - To the Hollywood Ten! - Thank you. To the Hollywood Ten! You're heroes! 28 cents. Gold lighter. Wallet. Cigarette case. Raise your hands. Open your mouth. Wider. Turn your head to the right. To the left. Tilt your head back. Spread your legs. Grab your sack and skin it back. Turn around. Spread your cheeks. Squat. Cough. Turn around. Move out. Next! So the warden says I gotta do right. Boy want a better job? I put him in charge of the whole goddamn supply room. 'Cause I know something the warden don't. Truck's unloaded. Driver needs a signature. Actually, uh, he needs it right here. You know, if, uh. If you need any help, I used to run shipping at a. At a bakery. Heard you's a writer. Well, that too. And a commie. What the fuck is wrong with you people? This is a great country. Agreed. You type? Stop. Well, now, if only I could read it. "Protocol as to return of goods. "There shall be triplicate copies of Form 14-A filed "with Supply, Shipping and Office of the Warden." You think you're gonna teach me the alphabet and I'm gonna shake your hand all grateful and say, "Thank you, Mr. Trumbo. You done change my life, sir. "I'll never forget you." I got 20 years for killing me a white man who tried to rob my bar. I did it and I'd do it again. You look down on me and I will fuck you up like you've never been fucked up in your whole bullshit Beverly Hills life. Now I'm here trying to build my time and make parole. You wanna help make that happen? Welcome to fucking Supply, Comrade. Dear Cleo, I don't count the days or hours. I count the seconds. Sometimes I think I'll die of boredom. Other times, fear. Not of this place. So far, its challenges are all surmountable. Augmented by days of lovely boredom. So flat and calm in the wake of all that churning ugly luckless battle. No, my fear is for what will happen when I get out. To our family and our country. Not all the news is worrisome. Some reminds me that what the imagination can't conjure reality delivers with a shrug. And reality has delivered in all its beatific wonder to the federal penal system, J. Parnell Thomas, convicted of tax evasion. Well, look at us. Just a couple of jailbirds. Except you actually committed a crime. Yet in all this, I know I'm the luckiest unlucky man ever to live, because you and the children warm, feed, clothe, pacify, and rejuvenate me by never leaving my heart. Love, Prisoner Number 7551. We're not gonna take that hill from the Japs with bullets, bombs or fists. Yeah! We're gonna take it with blood. Whoever spills more, loses. And we don't lose. Do we? No! You lose. That's what I thought. You know John Wayne? I do. What's he like? You'd love each other. Isn't he beautiful? Okay. - Mom, I got a new one. - Huh? Okay, wait. Come on, you're gonna scare the horse. Mom, you'd better come quick! Edward Robinson, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? I'm not now, sir, nor have I ever been a member of that party. I have always been a Liberal Democrat. But in your home over the years, there have been political meetings attended by those that we now know to be communists. Yes, sir. Yes, that has now been made clear to me. There were tremendous activities - and fundraisers. - Shit. .that went on in my house during the war. I did not know then all of their true affiliations or the work that they were up to. It never entered my mind that any of these people were communists. I was duped and used. I was lied to. But who used you? Well, um. These sinister forces who probably ran these organizations. Oh, tell us the individuals that you have reference to. Mr. Robinson? Well, uh, you had Albert Maltz. Um. I knew Frank Tuttle and that other fellow. That top fellow who they say is the, uh, commissar out there. Um. Arlen Hird? Yes, yes, Arlen Hird. I didn't know Dmytryk at all. I'm a commissar now. Ian McLellan Hunter and, uh, Dalton Trumbo. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions. Snitch like that in here, you end up fucking dead. Eddie ought to go back to work. He did what he had to. No, no, he did what he was forced to do. Well, the point is, he did it. Brave men and boys are fighting this battle against communism. They are sacrificing in ways we can't even imagine. And you wanna talk about some asshole's movie career? I'd see Eddie Robinson and everyone like him dead if it'd bring back one boy from Korea. Just one. So what are you saying? Guys like Eddie cooperate and get nothing? That isn't right. Careful, Duke. Or what, Hedda? If I'm not careful, what? I had no idea you were such a softie. That's me all right. All cuddles. Proud of ya, Eddie. Wasn't easy, I know. But you did good. Thanks, Duke. I'm gonna call the studios. The offers will pour in. Sure. Thanks. One of the greatest peacetime spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax, as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are sentenced to death for revealing atomic secrets to Soviet Russia. The junior senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, is ramping up his investigation into alleged communists he believes are infiltrating our government, our military, and our schools. .because the enemy has been able to get the traitors and dupes to do his work within our government. One communist on the faculty of one university is one communist too many. A man is either loyal or he's disloyal. Thank you, Billy. They're here! They're here! Dad! Dad! They're home! I'm being attacked by giants! Ah! What have you beautiful creatures done with my little ones? Oh, Dad, we missed you. - Christopher. Mitzi. - Hi, Dad. My goodness. Nikola, look at you. She got real tall. Oh, is that lipstick? Dad. Oh, I've missed you so much. All of you. Let's go inside. I wanna hear everything. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Oh, Buddy! Well, how are you? I got nothing to say to you. Looks like prison has given us the plague. Yeah, well, that Buddy Ross, he was always an asshole. Yeah. He's in trouble too. - Three movies, three flops. - Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. Look at him. He's trying to sell his soul, but he can't find it. I just hope he stays afloat long enough to get the shit sued out of him. Oh, really? By whom? By me and you and all of us. Jeez. We use their capitalist system against them. In civil court. We go after their money. - No. No. No. - For what they did to us! We make them swear under oath. No, no, no. Christ! Haven't you spent enough time in court? I know I have. Jesus Christ. Well, what else are we supposed to do? We do the one thing everyone says we can't. Look, you're a great writer. We make shit. I don't see it. Mr. King, I'm a screenwriter. If I couldn't write shit, I'd starve. Trumbo, we can't afford you. Well, how much did you pay for the script of that? Bad Men of Tombstone $1,200. All right. I'll write you a movie for $1,200, then. And you don't want your name on it? No, you don't want my name on it. You got that right. Especially if you're still, you know, up to stuff. Are you? Perpetually. Jesus. You got any ideas? Well, I just got out of prison. What about crime? A story of a gangster, his rise and fall. I've seen that a few times. Because it always makes money. All right, when do I get my goods? Three days. A 100-page screenplay in three days? Are you trying to fuck me? 'Cause if you fuck me, I will fuck you. Mr. King, I've heard this speech. It was better in jail. "No, boss. "He." Are you kidding me with this? Hymie, get out here! Hymie, pay the man! He's a genius. Beautiful. Wait a minute, look. We got Killer in the Swamp. The best character's the swamp. Oh, oh. Women in Prison. Dames fighting in their underwear. It's perfect, except it stinks. What else, Hymie? Pirates. Can't afford the ocean. That's it. Fix them all. You want more, we got more. Oh, baby! So, what do you think of the new neighborhood? - I like it. - Yeah, this is nice. - Yeah, Dad. - Well. It's gonna be good being in town. Whoa, look at that! - I brought you some lemonade. - Thank you. Hard work. You holding up okay? - Pretty good. - All right, thank you. We forgot the towels! Oh, shoot! Wait for me. Wait for me. Mitzi. Shh! Well, there are many angry and ignorant people in the world. They seem to be breeding in record numbers. Now, all we can do as a family is stick together and remain vigilant. The Mouth of Truth. Legend is that if you're given to lying, and you put your hand in there, it'll be bitten off. Oh, what a horrid idea! Let's see you do it. Let's see you do it. Sure. Hello. You beast! It's a huge hit. Great reviews. I haven't worked in nine months. You? Well, there aren't quite enough zeros in a King Brothers' salary to survive, but they need scripts like an army needs toilet paper. Quality minimum, quantity maximum. You'd think that when the artistic ambitions of a movie are non-existent, the work would be tossed off in a week. But consistently pleasing two former pinball salesmen turns out to be a high hurdle indeed. And I've become a stranger in my own house. Every workweek is seven days. Every day is 18 hours. Every minute, I'm further behind. They need five of you. Okay, the only question is, can these pinkos write? Well, the dapper gentleman in the gray suit is Ian McLellan Hunter. Guy who wrote Roman Holiday. Guy who just got subpoenaed. Guy who just got nominated for an Academy Award. Everyone at that table's been nominated. There's Alvah Bessie, and Adrian Scott. Arlen Hird. And Ring Lardner, Jr. and Albert Maltz and. Um. It'll be like this. I'll find the writer and work with him. He'll deliver the script to me. If it's good, I'll give it to you. If it needs work, I'll fix it. No one gets paid until you're happy. And these writers, they're. They're all. I mean, they're all black. Blacklisted. Jesus, you're such a chicken-shit. You know, we're at war with the communists. - No we're not. - It's a new kind of war. Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new. What about the Rosenbergs? They stole the atom bomb. They didn't steal it off a fucking camera truck. So look, we bought a gorilla suit. We gotta use it. Oh. Well. So, you had five jobs. Mmm-hmm. And now we got them and now you got none? Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers. And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on. To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business. Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad. So who wants to write a gorilla movie? Who doesn't? We now work at midnight in thick fog among strangers. Not literally. We're running a family business. We'll be adding new phone lines, and when answering, never say, "Trumbo residence." I'll be writing for various producers under different names. Whomever they ask for, you come find me. Or take a message. Hello? Is John Abbott there? No, sir, may I take a message? The door must be answered at all hours. Got a pickup for Sally Stubblefield. Can I get your mom to sign? Thank you. Dictation, shorthand and typing will be learned. Those of legal age will have one of the most important jobs imaginable. Courier. Scripts must be delivered to producers without raising suspicion. Any questions? Concerns? - Yes, Nikola. - Is there a schedule? A what? I need to know when I can do homework. And I'm part of a fundraising committee for Negro voting rights. Plus, every other Friday, we have meetings for Student Council. I'm. I have to. Niki, we'll figure something out, sweetheart. Won't we? And protests continued as the Supreme Court may soon take up the issue of racial segregation. Negros in Southern towns and cities have taken to the streets in large numbers. All under close scrutiny by local law enforcement. There have been unconfirmed reports of disturbances and rioting. But it is not clear if the violence was initiated by protesters. Nikola! .or white vigilante groups. Beyond the South, through the nation. Now, there you go. A few mistakes, not many. All right. .all top-salaried government officials should make a full public statement of their income. This concludes our program scheduled for today. Which one is Graham Tauper? Nympho Nun. Oh. Great job. Uh, Elwood Carr, Murder at the Circus. It needs work. I knew the clown did it. It's always the clown. So you are The Alien and the Farm Girl. Yeah. So you wrote the alien talking about the rights of the worker. The pathology of capitalism. The complacency of the bourgeoisie. I don't even know what it is and I fucking hate it. Well, the idea was to use the. I paid you to write a script about a guy with a giant bug head shtupping a girl in a hayloft. And you write shit that's gonna get me subpoenaed, and stinks! Fix it! Well, fuck Frank King. I said, until he's happy, I'd rewrite. So you're gonna stay up with that all night, for that crap? For what? To get it to his high literary and political standards? Well, it shouldn't be to anyone's political standards. It's The Alien and the Farm Girl, for Christ's sake. What the hell were you thinking? I was thinking. That's why I'm a writer. To say things that matter. Remember that? I was a reporter. I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I fought in Spain, and I know Ernest Hemingway. - I actually. I know him. - Oh, bullshit. And he knows me. If I walked into a bar in Paris, he. Maybe not my name, but he'll. I'll get a wave. Yeah. You. You won the National fucking Book Award. I mean, what are we doing? Okay, so the alien. The alien impregnates the farm girl. - Right. - Why? Because he wants to inseminate her and propagate a new species - on Earth and take over? - No. Because she reminds him of the girl he left behind. But he's got a bug head. His girlfriend's probably got a bug head back home. You don't get hung up on the looks of someone. He's falling in love with her. Uh, okay. You're over-thinking. - Are you all right? - Yeah. You want to do this later? No. Go, please. All right. I mean, do you ever miss writing something. Forget great, just good? I mean, you must have ideas still, right? I've got a few. There's one that won't go away. Cleo and I are in Mexico at a bullfight years ago. And the bull dies. And, uh, thousands of people are just cheering. Three weren't. Cleo, me and this young boy down front, crying. Always wondered why. Well, you write it and you'll know. But please promise me, not for Frank fucking King. Please. To present the writing awards, here is an actor who also reads. Mr. Kirk Douglas. Niki, hurry! Who's doing it? Kirk Douglas! I'm coming, I'm coming! The envelope. And the Oscar goes to Roman Holiday by Ian McLellan Hunter. Yes! That's you, Dad, that's you! Dad, that is fantastic! This is accepted on behalf of Ian McLellan Hunter. So do we get to be happy now? I don't want it. Well, I don't want it. Your name's on it. You wrote it. They gave it to you. And it's done me wonders. Here's the gorilla script. Huh. - Hey, Dad. - Ah? Phone for you. For which name? No, you. Some guy named Buddy Ross. Huh. So, is the rumor true? You wrote Roman Holiday? What can I do for you, Buddy? My movies have all bombed. Dug me into a hole. I finally got something going. Classy. Three big stars. The script. What script? There is no script. I got 11 writers who fucked me and now the actors are gonna pull out. And if they do, I lose everything. When do you shoot? Ten days. Is there anything? There'd be no credit, obviously. I can't pay you till we start shooting. I wouldn't blame you if you spit in my face. But we did good stuff back then. We really did. Please. I owe the King Brothers a rewrite. And I can't do both. Here it is. I need you to take over. So you can help that great guy, Buddy Ross. Mmm-mmm. So we can keep tearing down the blacklist. Oh, Jesus, here we go. This is going to be a very big movie, and if Buddy gets a good script. Which you're gonna give him. No, which I am going to sell him. For money, 'cause that's why we did all of this, right? Was for the money. Why can you not see this? If we get one big movie, we can get all the big movies. And then this whole rotten thing could collapse on the sheer irony that every unemployable writer is employed. Jesus Christ, do you have to say everything like it's going to be chiseled into a rock? I'm not gonna help you help Buddy Ross! God's sake! - You are against every. - No, I. - .solid idea that comes up. - Let's do something! These fuckers did things! We should be suing that cockroach into the ground - along with those congressmen. - There's an idea. - Yes, and the producers! - Very good one. - Yes, and the studios! - That'll be better. - We should sue them! - Oh, yes, brilliant! Keep losing. Give all of your money away to lawyers! I'd rather lose for the right reasons. Why? It's still losing. You lose. I lose. We all lose! Don't you see that? And the whole goddamn country stays scared and dead. Well, you really think you can go on living like this forever? Well, I'm not gonna have to. Arlen, we can do this. We can beat them. We can win! - I don't care if I win. - Bullshit! Everybody wants to win. No, you want to win. I want to change things. - I want to win so that I can change things. - No, you don't! You want to win so that you can get an Oscar with your name on it this time. And so you can get more money that you burn through, writing shit for idiots! Why do I have to explain everything to you like you're a fucking child? You don't have to. - You really don't have to. - Piss off! You know, you do what you do and that's fine for you. But don't pretend that you getting your career back is part of some great crusade for mankind. Okay? I'm doing this for everyone. Arlen. Fucking idiot. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Nikola Happy birthday to you Make a wish. Ah. I got it. Sweet 16! Get together with your sister. Chris, get in there. Ah. Thank you. Are you sure we shouldn't go knock? I'm sure. He can't take five minutes? Nope. Two minutes? Niki. One minute. Chris, would you please get the good plates? - Yes, Mom. - Thank you. Dad! - Dad! - Go away! We're having birthday cake. When you hear me working, you don't knock! But it's my birthday. You don't knock! Ever! So the house is on fire, you don't want to know? I work in a bathtub, surrounded by water. So I'm fairly certain that even if the whole goddamn country was on fire, that I could still function as this family's personal slave. And all I ask is to not be interrupted for every little slice of fucking birthday cake! What? It's ridiculous! Now I've lost my place. Christ's sake! .sure, maybe you, uh, get that long, happy life we all want. But your eyes never really close again. 'Cause you spend that life scared of every noise in the dark. We both do. I can't let you do this, Rocco. I'll just have to convince you I'm right. After all, kid, what are friends for? Don't defend him, okay? He knows he's wrong. He hasn't even apologized. I think you surprised him. He's not used to seeing another adult in the house. He has to be right all the time. How do you stand it? Well, it's challenging sometimes, especially lately. Hey, why don't you come downstairs with me? I wanna show you something. You see my gloves? Thank you. Do you imagine that's his head? No. But you can. Niki, is that the script already? Fantastic. Ah. Tell your dad that. Oh, hello. Um, I'm looking for Arlen Hird. Mr. Trumbo, it's Andrew. Good God! Look. Look at you! Wow. Well, I'm certain your father has told you some nasty things about me, but I want to assure you, they're all true. Is, uh. Is he home? I'm sorry. I thought you knew. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you so much. Andrew. Joshua. My dad left something for you. It's a record. Money that he owed you and some other people. I'm sorry. I wish we could pay you back. Andrew, no. I owed him. The debts are all mine. Thank you. Well. Hello, Eddie. This is a bit of a surprise. What can I do for you? Arlen died. I heard. I was on location. This is the money you gave us for the defense fund. It's everything that we owe you. Arlen included. No, now, that was a gift. We'd like it off our books. What is this supposed to be? Some kind of message? What you and Arlen and the great Hollywood Ten all think of me. Fine. Fine. But first you're gonna listen. After you went to jail, I didn't work for a year. No offers, not even an audition. People would see me, cross the street. People I loved. People I made rich. I sat in front of that committee. Why? I didn't do anything. None of us did anything. We were all stupid babies. With no business in any of it. I just wanted my life back. They had every name. Yours, Arlen's, everybody's. I didn't give them anything they didn't already have. I ended it, is all. I just. I ended it! Oh, Eddie, you don't end something like this. By giving them what they have no right to ask. You're gonna tell me how I should have handled it? Like you handled Congress? So you're saying that you're proud of what you did? Proud? Who the hell gets to be proud? You. You do. You with your fake names and your fronts. You've got all the work you want. I gotta go out in the world every day. This is my work. I've got nobody else to be. I did what I had to. You did what you wanted, Eddie. And you did it for more. More movies, more money, more dead bullshit on your walls. What I did, I did, but did you ever wonder how many years you hacked off Arlen's life? To show the world what a rebel genius you are. You live with that! Drinking alone? Preferably. And what are you up to these days? You know, Hedda, another one of these and I just may tell you. Oh, then I'm buying. Usual. Same again. Yes, Miss Hopper. Oh, come on, I hear the rumors. Show me you're still in the game, fighting the good fight. Come on, rub my face in it. Whisper a movie you've written in secret. Maybe I've even heard of it. Maybe you have. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm filming. It's crazy. Buddy, do you know Dalton Trumbo? Yes, I believe we have worked together before. What was it? Was it MGM? A million years ago. Nice to see you again, Buddy. I hear your new script's in trouble. Maybe you should hire Dalton. He used to be pretty good, and price-wise, he'd be bargain basement. Not that you'd ever do it. Not after Buddy named names. Oh, you didn't know? Word was he had hired someone he shouldn't have. So he got subpoenaed. He had to testify. Closed session. No press. Makes it easier. So, he named you, of course. Now he's been cleared. Gets to make his movie. In a way, thanks to you. Drink, Buddy? You look as if you need one. Can you believe it? Democrats voting for segregation. Oh, the Southern Dixie-crats. We started a petition for total integration. There it is. I already have over 1,000 signatures. Well, I'd be happy to make it 1,001. And this is the new draft that needs to be delivered to Hymie King in Agoura. Wait, Agoura? I thought the Kings were in Hollywood. Oh, no, no, no. These are the rewrites. They're to be shot tonight, so Hymie needs them on the set right away. Agoura's 40 miles. Yes, I'm sure Chris knows that by now. Well, he can't. I'm sorry? He has a date. He's taking her to a movie. Well, all right, then, Nikola, you'll deliver the draft. I have a protest. Since when do protests have hard start times? I'll take it. Nikola will take it. I said I can't. Young lady, you will. This is important. So is this. This is important to me. And the date's important to Chris, so figure something else out. Move on! He needs those now! Oh, honey. She hasn't been gone that long, and it's really not that late. You know, this is a blatant attempt to manipulate worry. Do you know when I realized that I had to leave Hal? Hal? Hal who? My first husband Hal. Jesus, take the wheel! It was my wedding night. My first wedding night with Hal. If we're going to go back in time to that unholy coupling, then I have a medical obligation to drink. I saw this was not a man I could have children with. Now, thank God for that. He'd bully me and them. And that we'd wind up like every miserable family since forever. But you. I knew you would never be like that. That whatever happened out there, all that would matter, really matter, was us. Well, all that matters is us. No. Not anymore. Well. You have no idea what you could lose. Oh, please! My career and the First Amendment, our country. Am I missing anything? Us. - You're losing us. - Oh. Since prison, you don't talk or ask. You just snap and bark. I keep waiting for you to start pounding the dinner table with a gavel. So in addition to being a pariah out in the world, I also have the supreme joy of battling insurrection - in my own home where these. - Battling insurrection? .ten fingers literally clothe and feed and shelter us. This isn't just happening to you! We all hurt! Niki, me, your friends! Friends? What friends? Who the hell has the luxury of friends? I've got allies and enemies. There's no room for anything else. We know. Good. Then this discussion ends. This isn't a discussion. It's a fight. I will not let our children be raised by a bully. Be back. All right. I didn't want to fight in front of my friends, but I'm not going home. I didn't come here to fight. You know, your mother is a quiet person. Normally. The effect of which is that she can actually make me hear myself. It's extraordinary. Lately, it's not a sound I like much. Mostly because what I hear is just how. How afraid I am. Afraid that I'm scarring you. All of you. And what if it's all for nothing? What then? Well, so, I fight. It's all I know how to do anymore. Any. I mean, it's just. Just rage at anyone who gets in my way. But you have never been in my way, Nikola. Not once. It's crazy how mad you make me. Since all I ever wanted was to be just like you. Well, I'm afraid to say that you've succeeded. We know, okay? It's a small town. The gossip's always true. Fire Dalton Trumbo and the rest of them or you got pickets, headlines and boycotts. We will put you right out of business. We? The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. Me and Ronald Reagan, Hedda Hopper, guilds, studio heads, John Wayne. I love John Wayne. Well, I'll introduce you. You guys could do a movie together. Oh, gee, that would be swell. Except I don't think - you and me are gonna be pals. - Hey, Frank! - You wanna keep me from hiring union? - Frank! Frank! I'll go downtown, hire a bunch of winos and hookers! It doesn't matter! - I make garbage! - Frank! You want to call me a pinko in the papers? Do it! None of the people that go to my fucking movies can read! - No, wait. I am in this for the money and the pussy and they're both falling off the trees. Take it away from me. Go ahead. I won't sue you, but this will be the last fucking thing you see before I beat you to death with it. Tiffany! Right here. Fuck you want? Uh. Oh, uh. - New script. - Oh, yeah? Yes, it's a family picture. Something I've been mulling. It's the story of a young Mexican boy and his pet bull. Sounds a little fruity. What's it called? The Brave One. Oh, one problem though. Expensive? Worse. It's good. Ol√©! Ol√©! Who told you? What else did they say? Well. You too. And thank you, Frank. What? The Brave One has been nominated for an Academy Award. Oh. - Really? - Yes, really! That's crazy. I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday. Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday. Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to. There is no Robert Rich. Who gets the thing if it wins? Well, maybe it won't. I mean, it's not that good. No offense. None taken. And now I'd like to say two of the most beautiful words in the motion-picture industry, Deborah Kerr. The nominations for Best Motion Picture Story are, Robert Rich for The Brave One, Leo Katcher for The Eddy Duchin Story, Jean-Paul Sartre for The Proud and the Beautiful, and Cesare Zavattini for Umberto D. The envelope please. The Brave One, Robert Rich! Dad! - You won! - Who's that guy? Mr. Jesse Lasky Jr., Vice President of the screenwriter's branch of the Writers Guild, will accept the award for Mr. Rich. On behalf of Robert Rich and his beautiful story, thank you very much. So weird. We can't find Mr. Rich anywhere. He apparently. Who the hell is Robert Rich? I gotta go. It had better not be who they say. - Mr. Trumbo. - Yes? Are you Robert Rich? Did you write The Brave One? Well, you see, it's my policy not to claim credit for any one movie. That way, it's possible that I had something to do with all of them. Except the stinkers, which were all written by my enemies. What's your position on the blacklist? Well, on it. Along with thousands of others. Are you using this Robert Rich controversy to try and end it? See, The Brave One is a nice little picture. And if rumors of my involvement can help sell tickets, well, then, good. And if the strange circumstances of its authorship raised a few questions, well, even better. - Trumbo? - Yes? - Phone for you. - Well, who is it? Some crazy guy, says he's Kirk Douglas. Really? Huh. Well, thank you, Nikola. Niki? Kirk. Kirk. Dalton. My apologies. We've had more than our share of crank calls lately. - I can imagine. - Please have a seat. May I get you a drink? No. No thank you. All right. - So? - I'm doing a new picture. And I just got the script. That must be seven hours of entertainment there. Not a single page is entertaining. But there's a good story in there somewhere. About one man who tried to take on the whole world. Well, you've got me so far. He was a slave who led a revolt against the Roman Empire. Hmm. Now, what's the title? Spartacus. No, no, no. I can't tell you what I'm working on now, except to say that the blacklist is alive and well and so is the black market. Well, yes, you can quote me on that. Seeing my name in the papers drives certain people out of their minds. Of course. Here he is. - Kirk. - Hedda. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Bob Stripling. House Un-American Activities Committee. Mr. Douglas. Mr. Stripling. Drink? No, thank you. You said it was important. Only if you hired Dalton Trumbo. Who I hire is my business. No, Mr. Douglas. It's ours. Why? 'Cause we have to keep this country safe. And how are you doing that? Well, why don't I show you by putting you on the stand? Hedda, is your friend trying to scare me? He's just trying to show you the way things are. Maybe I don't like the way things are. Kirk, we've known each other a long time. Since when did you become such a bastard? I was always a bastard. You just never noticed. Yes? I wish to see the man who wrote this. Please, come in. Thank you. I am Otto Preminger. The director. Forgive me, I. I've just finished work a few hours ago. I. A copy of which I've read. But how could. I just had that delivered this morning. I am Otto Preminger, the director. Please. Oh, yes, my youngest thinks that I can end the suffering of all broken birds. As can I, with a broiler. Are your duties completed for Mr. Kirk Douglas? No, but I do have two weeks off for Christmas. During which time you will work with me. Will I? If you're as intelligent as your writing. And as greedy as your reputation. Hmm. It is an adaptation of the novel Exodus. You've read it? No. A colossal bestseller. Very nearly a perfect piece of shit. But there's a good story in there somewhere. I have no idea. But I have Paul Newman. We have spoken. He is a little reticent, but I believe, at the right price, he will accept. So you're doing it? Well, I think it's the only way to get him to leave. It's very important. Poor Mr. Preminger. He thinks he's the cat and you're the mouse. Oh, look at that. Perfect. Hey, Mitzi, what's that? A Russian doll? Absolutely perfect. Oh! What is this, Santa? Just a little something for Mrs. Claus. I'll open it later. Christmas is over. Well. Did you read the new scenes? Dreadful. Keep up this level of work, and I will see to it your name is on my movie. To take the blame. Well, there you go. Ooh! Hello. Hi, Sammy. Oh, do you know that Kirk Douglas gave me this bird? It's a distraction. No. No, not at all. I named him Sam Jackson. He wrote Spartacus. Well? - Better. - Thank God. But it simply lacks genius. Otto, if every scene is brilliant, your movie is going to be utterly monotonous. I'll tell you what. You write every scene brilliantly, and I will direct unevenly. What is it, dear? Thank you. Oh, hello, Kirk. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Mitzi. Otto. How are you? I am very well, Kirk. I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt. No, no. No, not at all. Not at all. Otto, would you mind if we had a little chat? Won't be a second. I sort of feel like I walked in on my wife. Do you love him? Oh, it's far more lurid than that. He's paying me for my services. So am I. And you'll get them again, January 2nd, as promised. I just need you a few days on some of the new scenes. Of course, but not until the 2nd. I wouldn't ask, but I've never had a director who's a bigger pain in my ass than Stanley Kubrick. The worst part is, he's right. Well, I wouldn't refuse, but. Well, I really. This should remain between us. Of course. Well. Preminger has declared that. Well, what he said was, "You keep up this level of work, "and I'll see to it that your name is on my movie." - Really? - Oh, yes. Those were his exact words. Be in touch. Very well. Merry Christmas! You too. I suppose he wants you back. Well, no. No, no. He. He just stopped by to talk about a screen credit. On Spartacus? Well, I really shouldn't have said anything. You understand. Five minutes! Back in five minutes, everybody! Kirk, Hedda Hopper just told me the American Legion is going to boycott us unless you get rid of Trumbo. Ed, he's not done with the script. His name will never be on the thing. What's anybody boycotting? Kirk. Just a second. Please. Please. Just give me five seconds, please. Listen. Twenty million Americans are saying loud and clear, they will never buy a ticket to our movie unless you fire one writer. Here's 50! Pick one. Mind if I stick my nose in? Please. He knows. He sees Kirk Douglas coming in and out of here. And Otto Preminger and his Rolls. He's an idiot. But he's not stupid. Has he called the FBI? Congress? No, because everything they can do, they've already done. That Oscar belongs to you. Get it! My God! You're nothing like me. You're worse. For the record, you're Robert Rich? I am. I've been through the whole list, Ed. They're all hacks. And you wrote The Brave One? I did. Ed, let me call you back. Why come forward now? Well, as someone who has been thoroughly investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, I started wondering, why hasn't anyone taken a good long look at them and their work in the movie industry? You see, they were convened to uncover enemy agents, expose communist conspiracies and write anti-sedition laws. Well, here we are, thousands of hours and millions of dollars later. Agents uncovered, zero. Conspiracies exposed, zero. Laws written, zero. You see, all they do is deny people their right to work. And they can't even get that right. Academy Awards, two. And how does that feel? To have so undermined the blacklist that it's almost a joke. A joke? I know the blacklist that produced Robert Rich. I've seen its horror and cruelty. A hideous waste of life as I've walked in the long line of its anonymous. And I cannot invent one more witticism about Robert Rich or the Oscar he can't claim. Because that small, worthless golden statue is covered with the blood of my friends. I'll get it. Hello? Oh, hello, Otto. I've read your last draft. What do you think? My answer is on the front page of today's New York Times. You hated it that much? Merry Christmas, Mr. Trumbo. Ed, have a seat. - Well, why doesn't he kill him? - Kill him. Kill him! - Kill him, you imbecile! - Kill him! Kill him! Great. Great. Marty, have them put up the scene with Varinia and Crassus. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Listen, Kirk, I. - One second. Warren, I'd like you to put out a press release. The screen. One second, Warren. What do you remember when you think about Spartacus? He was a man who began all alone like an animal. Yet on the day he died, thousands and thousands would gladly have died in his place. What was he? Was he a god? He wasn't a god. He was simple man. A slave. I loved him. Warren, the press release will say, "The screenplay for Spartacus was written by Dalton Trumbo." Thank you. Kirk, if you don't get rid of Trumbo, I will. And right after I quit, you can reshoot all my scenes. You see, Ed, for better or worse, I am Spartacus. There's a picture coming out. It's called Spartacus. It's starring Kirk Douglas, and it is written by Dalton Trumbo. If there is some other writer's name on it, don't believe it. We're on to them. - Yes? - Now, listen, Ed. We'll picket every theater that movie is in unless you pull the prints tonight. And you get that traitor's name off it. Hedda, you can't put me in this position. That's expensive and pointless. Then you can kiss your movie, your studio and your miserable ass goodbye. Hollywood turns out in force to hail Ul's new film spectacle, Spartacus, on the premier of the $12-million picture, in the film colony. The protesters also showed up to remind everyone of the political controversy surrounding the making of this film. Cleo? What is it? What's wrong? Oh. It's over, isn't it? Yes. Yes. And we made it. Yes. President Kennedy enjoyed a rare evening off attending the new Kirk Douglas film, Spartacus. We are here live, awaiting the president's comments. Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President! It's a very controversial film. What did you think? Oh, I think it's a fine picture, and I think it's going to be a big hit. The implication of Kennedy's approval of this film are wide ranging. The novel was written by a former communist. The screenplay was adapted by a former communist. And this signifies the blacklist may be over, as Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger have openly hired and credited blacklisted writers. This is a clear repudiation of a decade-long fight by anti-communists. This next award is for the member who has advanced the literature of motion pictures. Occasionally, there appears among us a person whose virtues are so manifest, who so subordinates his own ego to the concerns of others, who lives in such harmony with all the standards of the community, that he is revered and loved by everyone. Such a man, Dalton Trumbo is not. It gives me great pleasure to present the Writers Guild of America Laurel Award to Dalton Trumbo. Congratulations. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Often, when I stand before the film community, there's an elephant in the room. Me. And I thought I would address that. The blacklist was a time of evil. And no one who survived it came through untouched by evil. Caught in a situation that had passed beyond the control of mere individuals. Each person reacted as his nature, his needs, his convictions, and his particular circumstances compelled him to. It was a time of fear. And no one was exempt. Scores of people lost their homes. Their families disintegrated. They lost! And in some. Some even lost their lives. But when you look back upon that dark time, as I think you should every now and then, it will do you no good to search for heroes or villains. There weren't any. There were only victims. Victims, because each of us felt compelled to say or do things that we otherwise would not. To deliver or receive wounds which we truly did not wish to exchange. I look out to my family sitting there, and I realize what I've put them through. And it's unfair. My wife, who somehow kept it all together, amazes me. And so what I say here tonight is not intended to be hurtful to anyone. It is intended to heal the hurt. To repair the wounds which, for years, have been inflicted upon each other. And most egregiously, upon ourselves. Thank you. Thank you kindly. If you receive the Oscar, what do you intend to do with it? I have. I have a daughter, 13 years old. I've been blacklisted since she was three. She's known the title of every motion picture I've written in this study. And she's kept that title secret till now. A soldier. When her friends say to her, as children do, "My father does so-and-so. What does your father do?" This has confronted her with a very real problem. It confronts her with the problem, and has since she was three, of who her father really is. And what her father really does. I, uh, think I will give this Oscar, if I get it, to that girl. I think I will tell her, "Well, here is one secret "you no longer need to be burdened with." I'll tell her we have our names back again. l hear they broke the bed!

C.</i> <i>the Roman legions,</i> <i>like a scourge of locusts.</i> <i>poured through the east.</i> <i>laying waste the land of Canaan</i> <i>and the Kingdom of Judea.</i> <i>Rome's lmperial Armies,</i> <i>a tumult in the hills.</i> <i>struck Jerusalem's walls</i> <i>in a three-month siege.</i> <i>Breaching the gates, these legions laid</i> <i>the dust of battle with a shower of blood.</i> <i>Under the eye of General Pompey,</i> <i>the Holy City fell.</i> <i>her people strewn</i> <i>like wheat in the harvest time of Rome.</i> <i>While Pompey, triumphant.</i> <i>dared take the last high place.</i> <i>the still-living heart of the city.</i> <i>the Temple.</i> <i>Here, on this most sacred ground</i> <i>in all Jerusalem.</i> <i>now Pompey's horse took its way.</i> <i>Where no pagan had ever set foot,</i> <i>in the court of the priests.</i> <i>most irreverent Pompey</i> <i>stood himself down.</i> <i>At last, here was the fruit of the harvest.</i> <i>Here, it was said,</i> <i>lay the treasure house of Jehovah.</i> <i>great statues of gold,</i> <i>as bright as the sun in this ancient land.</i> <i>So Pompey,</i> <i>burning for the touch of precious metals.</i> <i>entered the sanctuary.</i> <i>But entering, Pompey found</i> <i>only a scroll of parchment.</i> <i>a covenant with the one God,</i> <i>handed down by Moses.</i> <i>and venerated through the years.</i> <i>Thus, for more than 50 years</i> <i>after Pompey's invasion.</i> <i>the history of Judea could be read</i> <i>by the light of burning towns.</i> <i>If gold was not the harvest.</i> <i>there was a richness of people</i> <i>to be gathered.</i> <i>The battalions of Caesar Augustus</i> <i>brought in the crop.</i> <i>Like sheep from their own green fields.</i> <i>the Jews went to the slaughter.</i> <i>They went from the stone quarries</i> <i>to build Rome's triumphal arches.</i> <i>But Caesar could find no Jew</i> <i>to press Rome's laws.</i> <i>on this fallen land.</i> <i>So Caesar named one Herod the Great,</i> <i>an Arab of the Bedouin tribe.</i> <i>as the new, false,</i> <i>and maleficent King of the Jews.</i> <i>But from the dust at Herod's feet,</i> <i>rebellions of Jews rose up.</i> <i>And Herod, in reply, planted evil seeds.</i> <i>from which forests of Roman crosses</i> <i>grew high on Jerusalem's hills.</i> <i>And Herod the Great, passing pleased.</i> <i>bade the forest multiply.</i> <i>Yet, trapped in this darkness,</i> <i>the Jews survived.</i> <i>by one promise:</i> <i>God would send the Messiah</i> <i>to deliver them forth.</i> <i>And it came to pass in those days.</i> <i>that a decree went out</i> <i>from Caesar Augustus.</i> <i>that all the world should be taxed.</i> <i>And all went to be taxed,</i> <i>everyone into his own city.</i> <i>So it was that Joseph, a carpenter.</i> <i>went up from Galilee, unto Bethlehem.</i> <i>to be taxed</i> <i>with his espoused wife, Mary.</i> <i>who was with Holy Child.</i> <i>He found his own city</i> <i>much corrupted by Rome.</i> Are you the innkeeper? There is no room. No room, not even for a fly to squeeze in. Please, it's not for me. It's for my wife. She's expecting a child. You can find a place in the street! She's expecting her child tonight. Maybe I can give you a stall in the stable. We will have to spend the night in the stable. <i>Now, when this Holy Child was born</i> <i>in Bethlehem of Judea.</i> <i>three wise men came from the east.</i> <i>These were Caspar,</i> <i>Melchior and Balthazar.</i> <i>of Mesopotamia, Persia and Ethiopia.</i> A King of Judea, born in a stable? What kind of mockery is this? Herod is the only King in Judea. Who is this pretender? Is there something in your scriptures. about a new Messiah being born at this time? False messiahs are born under every cloud, Your Majesty. What shall we do, my son? You are my king, Father. It is for you to command. Lucius. order all newborn male children in that town put to the sword. That is my command, Lucius. I am a Roman soldier. I do not murder children. You are in my service by command of Caesar. Dare you disobey Caesar? Mary. while I slept, I heard a voice saying: "Take the child and his mother, flee into Egypt. "and stay there until you are told to return." Then we will go. <i>And so, when Joseph and Mary</i> <i>fled into Egypt.</i> <i>Herod's men, seeking all newborn sons.</i> <i>did slaughter the innocents of Bethlehem.</i> Not my son! Help me! <i>I.</i> I cannot breathe. Help me to my throne. A king who cannot walk to his own throne is no longer a king, Father. Put me on my throne. I will not die on my knees. <i>So Herod the Great,</i> <i>crushed by his many murders.</i> <i>self-crucified, fell dead.</i> <i>And Herod Antipas</i> <i>took murder for his crown.</i> <i>And so it was that with Herod's death.</i> <i>Joseph brought his family out of Egypt,</i> <i>and he took them to Nazareth.</i> <i>where the years passed, numbering 12.</i> - You are Joseph, the carpenter? - Yes. My camel litter needs repair. I'll look at it. - Peace be to you. - And to you. - Refresh yourself. - Thank you. - Your son? - Yes. And does he like being a carpenter? Yes, he does. There's a big world outside this garden, do you want him to see it? He will see it soon enough. Let me take him with me. I'll pay you well. I could use a lad like that to help me with my caravan. No. Someday he will leave me. but someone else will call him. And who will that be? My son will know him when he comes. I can mend it by tomorrow. Good. Have no fear. We're simply checking the census against the tax rolls. Now, you are. Joseph. - And you live here with your wife, Mary. - That is so. Who's this boy? My son, Jesus. I have no record of his birth. When was he born? Twelve years ago. - Where? - In Bethlehem. Bethlehem. Count those in the next house. See that the boy is registered before the year is out. <i>Thus, Joseph's family</i> <i>were once more forgotten.</i> <i>Twenty years passed.</i> <i>And Pontius Pilate,</i> <i>new governor of Judea.</i> <i>brought fresh armies south and east.</i> <i>But in the hills,</i> <i>10,000 rebel Jews lay hidden.</i> <i>Their leader, Barabbas,</i> <i>wanted as criminal and killer.</i> <i>now baited his traps</i> <i>for the Roman wolves.</i> There's too many of them, Barabbas. We will divide them. - There's a water sign on the hill. - Make sure it's safe. There's fresh water ahead, sir. - Shall I give the men a rest? - Not too long. Take one column to the waterhole. Column one, follow me. Columns, rest! Give me some wine. How much farther is Jerusalem? Another day's journey. You should drink water, my husband. Wine only increases the thirst. I enjoy it. Judea. A fine wedding present your father gave me. My dear Pontius. it is said whoever can govern Jerusalem can govern anywhere, even Rome. Do you think Tiberius really has me in mind as his successor in Rome? I wish I knew my father's mind. as well as I know my husband's ambition. <i>And Herod Antipas</i> <i>rode out to meet Pontius Pilate.</i> <i>and show him the way to Jerusalem.</i> Another troublemaker. Who is this one? This one is called John the Baptist. He preaches to the people to repent before the coming of the Messiah. I baptize you with water. But one mightier than I shall come after me. And he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. One more messiah on the way. Will these Jews never tire of inventing deliverers? I have heard that name, John the Baptist. I hear he speaks evil things of me wherever he goes. His heart should be ripped from his body. Your daughter, Herodias, grows more like her mother day by day. Do I not please you? My step-daughter pleases me very much, Salome. Lucius, keep your eye on this man. One day you'll have to arrest him. - On what grounds? - On my orders. I'm bound only to take orders from the Roman governor when he arrives. Tell me, Lucius, what manner of man is Pontius Pilate? How should I treat him? What is his weakness? The same as any man: Vanity. Call the others to return! Legions, all stand! Barabbas! Barabbas! Who are these men? Bandits? - They call themselves patriots. - A man named Barabbas leads them. Have you captured him? This land is full of caves and hidden valleys. It'd take half the legions of Rome to ferret them out. I want him in chains before the end of the year. Putting him in chains would be easy. but putting our hands on him. that's what's difficult! I baptize you with water. But one mightier than I shall come. And he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Are you Elijah? No, I am not. Are you the Messiah? No, I am not! I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. The Messiah is one who will come after me. You are welcome. Peace be on this house. What would you have of me? I seek your son. My son has gone into the desert. Why did he come to the river? For you to baptize him. He is without sin. How could I baptize him? I preach in the wilderness. but the Word must be brought to Jerusalem. Yet I know I am not the one to deliver it. Only he can. When his time comes. he will be there. You say that with sadness. And joy! <i>And Jesus, baptized.</i> <i>returned from Jordan,</i> <i>and went into the wilderness.</i> <i>And with the baptism,</i> <i>the Holy Spirit came upon him.</i> <i>and a voice said to Jesus:</i> <i>"Thou art my beloved Son,</i> <i>in thee I am well pleased. " <i>And Jesus knew the wilderness.</i> <i>its day of heat.</i> <i>its night of cold and solitude.</i> <i>And stayed himself there</i> <i>to commune with God.</i> <i>and strengthen himself</i> <i>for the times to come.</i> <i>And ate nothing and hungered.</i> <i>And brought his soul forth in the light.</i> <i>to be seen of himself and known.</i> <i>And was 40 days tempted of the devil.</i> Behold! I am here! Come! I command you! Come! Be tried and found wanting! If you are the Son of God, command these stones that they be turned to bread. Man does not live by bread alone. but by every word of God. Behold! I show you all the kingdoms of the world, in a moment of time. All this will I give you, and the glory of them. If you will worship me, all shall be yours. Lo! Come to this high place. If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here. For will not His angels save you from falling and prevent your death? Come to the high place. Be gone! I worship the Lord my God. and only to Him do I do service. Come! Come, if you will. but I shall not call upon the Lord my God to stop you. You shall not force me to put the Lord my God to the proof. <i>And when the devil had ended</i> <i>all his temptations, he departed away.</i> <i>And Jesus came out of the wilderness,</i> <i>and was seen by men.</i> There is your new rabbi. He is the Lamb of God. <i>And Jesus called those of his choice.</i> <i>And two of the chosen</i> <i>were John and Andrew.</i> <i>and they followed where he led.</i> <i>And Jesus took himself down</i> <i>by the Sea of Galilee.</i> <i>And there did name his third apostle,</i> <i>and summon him forth on land.</i> Simon! You have been chosen! You are Simon. You shall be called Peter, the rock. upon which I will build. What will you have me do, Rabbi? I am just a fisherman. Come with me. and I will make you a fisher of men. Attention. I have just made a tour of the city. I found no statues, no banners. no emblems of Caesar anywhere. Where are they? The Jews have only one god. Their law forbids the presence of any image. Where are the chests I brought from Rome? Open them. A good likeness of Tiberius, is it not? Surely they dare not object to the Emperor's image. These people can. Their law is their religion. Place them on the pillars of their Temple. Behold! The sign of the pagan! As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. so shall He send hosts to destroy the idol-worshipers. The day is coming when the sword shall descend upon her legions. Her mighty kings and princes shall grow feeble. Her stolen treasures made worthless. Her cities shall crumble into dust. We shall raise our voice. and be heard. Take down the plaques! <i>When He comes,</i> <i>He will clear the threshing floor.</i> <i>and gather the grain into His barns.</i> <i>But the chaff.</i> <i>He will burn with unquenchable fire.</i> <i>The shepherds</i> <i>who lead their flocks astray.</i> <i>shall be cast out.</i> <i>The high shall fall.</i> Make him stop. <i>And the fallen shall rise.</i> Draw the curtains. <i>The cry of the wicked shall fall upon.</i> It's a very strange voice. Who is that man? Just another prophet. An agitator. Must he agitate beneath your palace window? Send him away. The harangue is directed against you. for mounting graven images on our Temple walls. - The incidents in Caesarea were bad. - The plaques stay. Do something about this man. He is harmless. He gives the people the type of entertainment they want. It is not wise to molest him. My husband is afraid of that madman. He thinks he's a holy man. A holy man who speaks words of treason. Caiaphas! You are the High Priest in that man's House of God. Do you not punish such conduct? Punishment does not dampen their ardor, rather it increases their wrath. We have found it wiser to ignore the ravings of these false prophets. than to persecute them. In my opinion, this man seeks martyrdom. I will put a stop to his voice tomorrow. Tomorrow! You've been saying that ever since he came from Jerusalem. I have given my word. The word of a king or a puppet? <i>And strip the clothes of the slaves,</i> <i>and make them go naked.</i> <i>Men groan.</i> <i>and the souls of the oppressed.</i> Go away, you vile man! Daughter of adultery. there is but one that can save you. Go seek Him out. Kneel at His feet and ask forgiveness for the sins of your mother. That man is no prophet. He wears the rags of a beggar. - It is best to ignore him. - Ignore him? There is only one way to deal with a beggar. You! You, there! Speaker! Step forward! You have your alms. Now, be gone! Bring the beggar in. When Pompey's legions invaded our land, they slew all the priests in the Temples. Since then, we have received our priesthood appointments from Rome. The people have little love for any man appointed by your emperor. At night the thief goes out. in darkness he digs under the <i>house.</i> Stop! Hold your peace. - Come with me. - Take me. but you cannot stop him who comes after me. We will worry about that when it happens. Come, you foolish man. Tell me, what is your occupation? I do the bidding of the Lord, my God. Judging from your appearance. your God seems to be a rather unprofitable master to serve. I do not seek my reward in the world you live in. Nevertheless, you will find one here. Yes, we do live in a very wicked world. You frighten me, you angry man. Salome, come back! This beast amuses me. Make him dance. on a bed of hot coals. It were better to cut his vicious tongue from its roots. Woman. is not your cup of abominations full enough? You dare to say that to my face? Get down on your knees and beg my forgiveness! You, woman? Who has given herself to the captains of Assyria? To the young men of Egypt? Who has deserted her first husband's bed to live in incestuous lust with his brother? Is there blood in your veins. or poison? Lucius, break his skin with your sword. I want to see. Our supper grows cold. Do you intend to do nothing with this man? Herod, Pilate has asked you a question. Lucius. take this man to the dungeon. Would you like me to come and visit you in your new cave? You are the seed of evildoers. the child of corruption. Leave this house of darkness. Find your way into the light while there is yet time. <i>But if some were imprisoned in this day.</i> <i>yet many another was set free</i> <i>from the illness of their bodies.</i> <i>It was the time of miracles,</i> <i>and Jesus put forth his hand.</i> <i>and cleansed those who were vexed</i> <i>with unclean spirits.</i> <i>For there went virtue out of him,</i> <i>and healed them all.</i> I thought you would leave me here to starve. What took you so long? A new prophet has come to Jerusalem. He has the same first name as yourself: Jesus. We need more fighters and fewer prophets. except for John the Baptist. If I had that man on my side. I could wake up the people, and we would rid ourselves. of Antipas and the Romans. This man is greater than John the Baptist. In what way? I talked with one of his disciples. This Jesus. was proclaimed by John the Baptist as the man he was waiting for. I need a prophet to help me win over the people. Can we convince this man? His disciple says he speaks only of peace. Peace? There'll be no peace in Jerusalem, unless it is won by the sword. It's not safe for you on the street. I must speak with this man. What does a man profit, if he shall gain the whole world. and lose his own soul? Could you explain the parable of the tares of the fields? He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man. And the field is the world. We are strangers in your city. We seek one called John the Baptist. Can you tell us where to find him? She's evil. Stone her! - Stone her! - She's a harlot. She must die! She's evil. Stone her! - Let her be stoned. She must die. - She's an adulteress. What has this woman done? She's been caught in adultery, and she must be stoned according to the law. She's a harlot. She must die! - Let her be stoned! - She must die! She's a harlot. She must die! Then let him who is without sin amongst you cast the first stone. Woman, where are they now who condemned you? Then neither will I condemn you. Go and sin no more. If you would find John the Baptist, he lies in the palace dungeon. - What was his crime? - He told the truth. He may be the one we have waited for. I must speak with him. <i>And, Barabbas, so near to Jesus.</i> <i>now turned and fled</i> <i>from the Roman guards.</i> <i>Leaving behind a man</i> <i>seeking answers from one stone.</i> <i>whether to run with Barabbas,</i> <i>the messiah of war.</i> <i>or walk with Jesus,</i> <i>the new Messiah of peace.</i> What is it? Another one wants to see John the Baptist. - Send him away. - He will not go. I mean, I do not know how to send this one away. Show him in. The prisoner, John, is not allowed visitors. If you wish to send him a message, leave it with the guard. I would see John. Why? I come to free John. And just how do you propose to break him free from his cell? I come to free him within his cell. Freedom? Behind stone walls? You are free to come and go as you please. and yet you are still a prisoner because you place faith in nothing but your sword. Who are you? Where do you come from? My name is Jesus. I come from Nazareth. Nazareth? I have not been there for many years. yet your face is familiar. You once came to our house and spoke to my mother. The house of the carpenter? For some reason unknown to me, I have favored your mother once before. I will give you a moment with the prisoner, John. But remember this: As you have your duty to your God, so do I to my emperor. Break Caesar's law. and you shall find in me the most merciless of all men. Ichebious! Let him take a look at the baptizer. John. Give me your blessing! <i>The name of Jesus</i> <i>moved through the land.</i> <i>and yet others came to walk with him.</i> <i>And they were Philip and Bartholomew.</i> <i>And one more joined them near the city.</i> Take me with you, Rabbi. Come! What is your name? Judas. - And yours? - John. - He's mad! - He's a madman! Madman! You are his mother? Yes. Who has sent you? I have journeyed from Jerusalem to see where he lives. Come, I will show you. I am alone, now. Share my table. I am a woman of sin. You will share my table. I have done much evil. Child, God knows evil exists, as well as good. Just as there is light and darkness. Evil exists that we may be the better for it. Will you speak to your son for me? Intercede. Has not my son said: "What man having 100 sheep, if he lose one of them. "does not leave the 99 in the wilderness. "and go after that which is lost, until he find it? "And when he has found it, he lays it upon his shoulders, rejoicing. "And when he comes home, he calls his friends and neighbors together. "and sayeth unto them: "'Rejoice. "'for I have found the sheep. "'which I lost."' You would not have sought out this house if God had not wanted you to. Come. Share my table. "Noble Pilate, the day before the ides of April. "the man Jesus left Jerusalem, accompanied by five of his disciples: "Peter, Andrew, John, Philip. <i>''.and</i> Nathaniel. "Outside the walls of the city. "they were joined by a sixth disciple. "a man called Judas Iscariot. They traveled north. "The fourth day after the nones of May. "the man Jesus and his disciples entered the town of Capernaum. "There Jesus laid hands on a madman and cast out the demon in him. "The same evening, the man Jesus brought a dying child back to health. "Two miracles in one day! " But, <i>Lucius.</i> These <i>things.</i> Can they really be true? I do not know, my lady. I, myself, have never seen a miracle. There are no such things as miracles. Only fools who believe in them. Continue. "The day after the nones of June. "at the crossroads. "a Roman tax collector by the name of Matthew saw Jesus pass. "and promptly left his tax collecting duties. "and has joined up with the man Jesus and become the seventh disciple. "A harlot from Jerusalem by the name of Magdalene. "is also residing in the same house." Tax collectors and harlots! "The day before the nones of July. "the man Jesus spoke to a crowd of over 5,000 people at the foot of Mount Tabor. "near Lake Galilee. "Lt is reported that with a basket containing. "two fish and five loaves of bread. "the man Jesus fed the entire multitude." I never heard such absolute nonsense! "The day after the ides of July, Jesus was seen to walk on the water of Lake Galilee." Ridiculous! "That evening a storm ravaged the lake, threatening the lives of fishermen. "The man Jesus raised his arm. - Does our Lucius mock me? - <i>''.the</i> wind died, the storm ceased." So it is reported. <i>Then Lucius, thinking on Nazareth,</i> <i>the long years.</i> <i>the mother, the child, and the miracles.</i> <i>did go to see John the Baptist.</i> You have treated me well. I should like to ask just one more kindness. Ask! Before I leave this world. I would send a message to Jesus. What is the message? Ask of him, in these words: "Was it your coming that was foretold. <i>''.or</i> are we to expect another? " You doubt him? I do not doubt him. But I would like to hear it from his own lips. You are always looking at her. You are sick with jealousy. Dance for me, Salome! Salome. Drink a little wine! Taste it. so that I may drain the cup. I am not thirsty. Come and sit next to me. I will give you the throne of your mother. You are not enough of a king. You keep the man who reviled my mother in a dungeon. when he should have died months ago. Why do you let him live? I have had talks with him. John is a very great prophet. He's a madman, and you are afraid of him. I am afraid of no man! Salome, dance for me. I command you to dance! I will not dance. You cannot refuse me. Salome will now dance for us! I do refuse! Salome, I beg of you. I will give you anything you want. - Anything? - Even unto the half of my kingdom. Do you swear? By my life, by my crown, and before the Governor of Judea. Whatever it is you want, I will give it to you. even if it is the throne of your mother. You have given your word. I'm the slave of my word. and my word is the word of a king. Anything I want? Now, Salome, what would you have for your dance? I want. on a silver <i>platter.</i> What on a silver platter? A ruby? A diamond? A pearl? I want the head of John the Baptist. Have you gone mad? What can you want with the head of a man? I want to look at it. Salome, listen to me. I have jewels hidden in this palace. jewels that thy mother even has never seen. Jewels that are marvelous to look at. Great topazes! Opals that burn with a fire as cold as ice! Give me the head of John the Baptist. or let it be known to everyone here. that the word of the king is worthless. Give her what she asks. <i>John the Baptist</i> <i>has sent a message to ask me:</i> <i>"Is it your coming that was foretold,</i> <i>or are we to expect another?"</i> <i>My answer to John is your testimony.</i> <i>What you people here have witnessed:</i> <i>How the blind see once more.</i> <i>How the lame walk.</i> <i>The lepers are made clean.</i> <i>The deaf now hear.</i> <i>I say to John,</i> <i>"What was it you expected to see.</i> <i>"when you went out into the desert?"</i> <i>Was it a reed trembling in the wind?</i> <i>No, that is not what you expected to see.</i> <i>Was it a man, clad in fine garments?</i> <i>No! You must look in king's palaces for</i> <i>proudly-dressed men who live in luxury.</i> <i>Why, then, did he go out?</i> <i>To see a prophet?</i> <i>I say to John the Baptist:</i> <i>"Blessed is he who keeps his faith."</i> <i>And I further say to all of you:</i> <i>"God has raised up</i> <i>no greater son of woman.</i> <i>"than John the Baptist."</i> All over Galilee the disciples of Jesus are calling for a gathering to hear him speak. This new prophet, Jesus, he speaks like John the Baptist. How do we know it's not the same man? Perhaps John has risen from the dead. Why did I do it? I am not an evil man. Why did I do it? You should've done it the day you imprisoned him. He's John the Baptist. He's come back as Jesus. Superstition! Tell him it is not true! I knew John the Baptist and I have met Jesus. They are not the same man. Stop him. Call your soldiers. Arrest him! And start a rebellion? All Rome wants is peace and taxes. I don't intend to spend all my life in this miserable country. Where is this gathering taking place, Lucius? A mount in the hills of Galilee. Have you any suggestion? Not until I hear what the man speaks. Go to this meeting, Lucius. Let the man talk. Listen to him. If he utters a single word treasonable to Rome. you'll have to act. I tell you, it is John the Baptist rising again! <i>And so much was the fame</i> <i>that went abroad of Jesus.</i> <i>that there was a gathering of people,</i> <i>like flocks from the hills.</i> <i>Great multitudes came</i> <i>out of all Judea and Jerusalem.</i> <i>and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon.</i> <i>which came to hear him, and to be healed.</i> My lady, it is not safe for Pilate's wife to be here. I must hear this man. Will you stay with me, Lucius? They have all gathered, and are awaiting your word. Blessed are you who are poor. for yours is the kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are you who do hunger and thirst after righteousness. for you shall be filled. Blessed are those who are merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. And blessed are those who are mourners, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are those who are pure in heart. for they shall see God. And blessed are you who are the peacemakers. for you shall be called the children of God. And blessed are you who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven. Give us a sign from Heaven! Prove to us who you are. Blessed are you when men shall curse you. and separate you from their company, and reproach you. and cast out your name as evil. for the Son of Man's sake. When? When is the Kingdom of God coming? Watch as you may, you will not see it come. No one will say, "Here it is," or, "There it is." For the Kingdom of God is within you. Rabbi! What must I do to inherit eternal life? What is written in the law: To love the Lord, your God, with all your heart. with all your soul. with all your power and all your mind. And love your neighbor as you love yourself. Do that and you shall live eternally. I'm a camel driver. Who can I call neighbor? He to whom you show mercy and compassion. whether you know him or not. Are you the Messiah? I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. Do you speak against the law of the prophets? I come not to destroy the law or the prophets. but to fulfill them. For I say unto you: Love your enemies, bless them who curse you. and pray for those who despise and persecute you. For if you love only those who love you. what reward shall you have? If you are a holy man. why do you eat and drink with sinners and tax collectors? The healthy have no need of a physician, but the sick do. I come not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance. I am a tax collector. I worship in the Temple every day, yet they despise me. What can I do? No man can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other. or cling to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon. And I say unto you: Be not anxious for your life. for the food you eat. or for your body or the clothes you wear. for is not life greater than food? And your bodies more than the clothing? Behold the birds of the sky. They neither sow nor reap, nor take their harvest to the barns. And yet God feeds them. How much more are you than they? Consider the lilies of the field and how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin. And can anyone of you, by worrying. add a moment to your years? My wife and I believe in you, but we are poor. We have nothing to give. How can we show you our faith? You have, by what you have said. Come to me, all of you who labor and are heavy-laden. and I will refresh you. Rabbi! Rabbi, I believe you're the Messiah. How can I serve you? The Son of Man comes to serve, not to be served. Whoever among you who would be great must be a servant. And whoever will be first must be the slave of all. We have heard the voices of false messiahs before. How do we know you are not sent by Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, the kingdom cannot stand. If Satan also be divided against himself, how then can his kingdom stand? How can Satan cast out Satan? I see before me flesh and blood. You are only a man. Why do you make yourself out to be the Son of God? If I am not doing the deeds of my Father, do not believe me. But if I am doing them and you will still not believe in me. believe in the work I do. If you can do miracles, call upon God to send hosts. to destroy the Romans and free our people from bondage. Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God. The Romans are conquerors. To conquer them would make you no different than they. Rabbi, what is faith? If you have faith that is no greater than this grain of mustard seed. and say to the mountain, "You shall <i>move''.</i> the mountain will move. Nothing is impossible. How judge a transgressor? Judge not, lest you be judged. For you will be judged by the standards you yourself shall apply. Why do you note the speck in your brother's eye. and take no notice of the beam in your own eye? You hypocrites, first remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's. Give not that which is holy to dogs. Neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet. and then turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, and you shall receive. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you. For everyone who asks receives. And every seeker finds. And to all those who knock, the door is opened. Is there a man among you. who would hand his son a stone if he asked for bread? Or a serpent if he asked for fish? Lf, then, you who are evil. know how to give your children what is good. think how much more your heavenly Father. will give good things to those who ask Him? Therefore, treat your fellow man as you would have him treat you. For this is the law of the prophets. Teach us to pray. Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom. and the power, and the glory. for ever and ever. Amen. Words. The Rabbi is calling you. Your friend is one of those who did not understand. What did the man say? He spoke of peace. Iove. and the brotherhood of man. Is that all? That is all. What is the matter? The look on Lucius' face. He had a long journey. He looked tired. He looked more than tired to my eyes. Good night, Caiaphas. - Do you believe in him? - I do. Self-appointed saviors like your Jesus. might stir the people up against the Romans. - But he is a good man. - You are a fool, Nicodemus. Good or bad, he's a threat. If Pilate could use Jesus and his followers as an excuse. he would massacre our people. What do you intend to do, Caiaphas? For the present, we will bide our time. <i>Then Jesus called unto him his disciples,</i> <i>the chosen 12.</i> <i>whom he also named Apostles.</i> <i>and led them into the wilderness.</i> <i>And these were Simon, called Peter,</i> <i>and Andrew.</i> <i>James and John, the sons of Zebedee.</i> <i>Philip and Bartholomew,</i> <i>Matthew and Thomas.</i> <i>And James, the son of Alphaeus.</i> <i>Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite.</i> <i>And among them, Judas Iscariot.</i> <i>Now, none of these chosen</i> <i>were most learned.</i> <i>None was a teacher of great truths.</i> <i>None was rich and powerful.</i> <i>They but knew the waters of Galilee,</i> <i>the shores and fields beyond.</i> <i>But knowing this,</i> <i>they were most rare, simple and precious.</i> <i>For they were the pure in heart</i> <i>and but needed instruction.</i> <i>For Jesus saw his own disciples</i> <i>doubt him.</i> <i>Awed by his miracles, faithful to him.</i> <i>Still they wondered why the Messiah.</i> <i>could not raise up miraculous armies</i> <i>to strike Judea free.</i> <i>Could simple love and brotherhood</i> <i>be weapons against Rome?</i> <i>For the disciples, like the multitudes.</i> <i>were troubled</i> <i>by the Sermon on the Mount.</i> <i>They had come seeking</i> <i>earthquakes and whirlwinds.</i> <i>the word of Jesus to smite the heavens.</i> <i>drop fiery swords in their upraised hands.</i> <i>drown Caesar's chariots in the sea.</i> <i>This, then, was Jesus' task:</i> <i>To keep his disciples</i> <i>from the doubting cities.</i> <i>To give them fresh wisdom wherewith</i> <i>to cleanse themselves, as with water.</i> <i>To make them men of God.</i> <i>Peace and love he taught them,</i> <i>in many tongues.</i> <i>And the days passed,</i> <i>and the time of teaching was at an end.</i> And those we help, how shall they reward us? You receive without payment, give without payment. Take neither gold, nor silver, nor copper under your belts. Nor staffs. You send us out sheep among wolves. Then be as wise as the serpent, and as harmless as the dove. And at the appointed time, I will join you in Jerusalem. <i>And he blessed them and</i> <i>sent them two by two before his face.</i> <i>into every city and place to heal the sick,</i> <i>to preach the Kingdom of God.</i> <i>and to have authority over evil.</i> Yes, there is rust. And the water is too warm. It can only mean one thing: Someone is forging weapons. Blacksmiths can operate only in the western end of the city. These waters come from the underground cellar in the eastern end. Can you locate this cellar? The eastern end is honeycombed with cellars. Some we could never find. You should not have killed this man. You should have saved him for questioning. Go on! Make more weapons to kill more people. That is what I intend. But while the metal cools, think! - You saw Jesus, you heard him speak. - He speaks only of peace! I am fire. He is water. How can we ever meet? The day after the next Sabbath, Jesus comes here to join his disciples. - Here, in Jerusalem? - In Jerusalem. To preach at the greatest Temple in all the land! Such crowds will gather, the Romans will not dare touch him. Then, Barabbas, is the time. Move your men to stand by Jesus, but keep their swords sheathed. Let your strength be known, but silent. Let Jesus speak. When his message of peace sweeps the city. let the people proclaim him King of Judea. How can he refuse? If he can free the Jews without spilling blood. he deserves the crown. I'll shape the crown myself, and place it on his brow. You will stand beside him in the Temple, then? You will give him time to speak? Yes. That will be a day to be remembered. - It will be remembered. - Barabbas! Judas dreams. And all dreamers are fools! This is the hour that we have waited for. Yes! Jesus comes to the Temple. Let him! He brings us our audience. We'll borrow them. We'll run them through the streets to the fortress. This way, and that. - Your people, Seth, will storm the gates! - Yes. - Yours, Enoch, will breach the north wall. - Right. I will scale the wall to the south. Quickly done and over, we will lend the crowd back to Jesus. - Is that fair or not? - Yes, fair! No one but Barabbas would attempt such a thing! You speak of Barabbas with respect? I always respect the enemy. Men like Lucius keep our empire together. Your tour of duty in Jerusalem ended years ago, Lucius. - Why do you stay here? - Where else would I go? But Rome is brilliant. I seem to have a talent for surviving small wars. Politics and brilliant society would destroy me. Personally, I suspect you found our Roman gods too cruel. Are you also awaiting the coming of the local Messiah? To believe in the Messiah, one must believe in God. What I've witnessed in my years on earth is proof enough that there can be no God. How many followers has he? Who? God? Jesus? Or Barabbas? Barabbas. How many dissatisfied Jews are there in Jerusalem? Have you considered the possibility of Jesus' and Barabbas' followers. joining forces? I have. Where would it happen? Since we are here, here. <i>And for many months</i> <i>Jesus preached through Judea.</i> <i>and angered the scribes</i> <i>and the Pharisees.</i> <i>who thought how they might kill him,</i> <i>and numbered his days.</i> <i>Knowing the sum thereof.</i> <i>Jesus came to spend time</i> <i>with his mother.</i> Blessings on this house! Welcome, Peter, John. We have done all you asked. It is time we leave for Jerusalem. The chair will have to wait until I return. The chair will never be mended. I am going with you! <i>Now the Jewish Passover was near.</i> <i>and many went from the country</i> <i>to Jerusalem.</i> <i>to purify themselves and make holiday.</i> He's coming! <i>And Jesus, come from Bethany</i> <i>and the Mount of Olives.</i> <i>did enter Jerusalem on that day</i> <i>to preach in the Temple.</i> <i>for the Temple was Judea.</i> <i>His words, spoken here.</i> <i>would echo in</i> <i>Tiberias, Samaria and Caesarea.</i> <i>From here he might speak to the world,</i> <i>if the world might listen.</i> <i>and the waves be still.</i> <i>As the city prepared</i> <i>for the Passover killing of the lamb.</i> <i>the men of Barabbas</i> <i>planned stranger celebrations.</i> <i>made ready more terrible sacrifices.</i> <i>And Jesus went into the Temple.</i> <i>And the great doors</i> <i>shut up one multitude.</i> <i>and within was peace.</i> <i>while outside</i> <i>was the sea that would not be stilled.</i> <i>The tongue which spoke not peace,</i> <i>but the sword.</i> Long live Judea! Judea! Come. Get back! Now! Come on! Help me. We will never rise again. The glory of Judea is dead. The Romans were waiting for us. We had no chance. So many of us dead, for nothing. We must escape into the desert and hide. It was you who told Barabbas the new rabbi would show us the way. He does nothing but pray in the Temple. The Rabbi will help us. How will he help us? He has the power of miracles. He will not use his power, except to heal the sick. He can call down hosts to destroy the fortress of Pilate. He preaches against violence. He can, with a look, rock the foundations of Herod Antipas' palace. and bring the walls down on the tyrant's head. He has never done these things before. Why will he change now? I will force his hand. Not with us! I will force his hand. Once he feels the Roman sword at his throat. he will strike them down with the wave of one arm. <i>Now came the days of unleavened bread.</i> <i>And Jesus.</i> <i>knowing these to be</i> <i>his final hours on earth.</i> <i>did send to prepare a Passover feast.</i> <i>And there, a last time,</i> <i>stood with and among his disciples.</i> <i>And gathered them in, all 12.</i> Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe. who bids us eat bitter herbs. Tonight, one among you will betray me. What you must do, do quickly. I will be with you for only a short time. Where are you going? Where I go, you cannot go, but you will follow me afterwards. We'll follow you to the ends of the earth. Tonight you will all lose courage and desert me. Impossible. I would not desert you. I would go to prison. I would die first. Believe me, Peter, this night, before the cock crows twice. you will deny knowing me three times. - Never! - No. Impossible! We'd never desert you. Never. My last wish. is that you love one another as I have loved you. The greatest gift a man can give is to lay down his life for his friends. When I am gone you will be grieved. But your grief will turn into joy. A woman in childbirth feels pain. But when her child is born, she does not remember the pain. For a child has been born into the world. And one day I will see you again, and when I do. your joy will be such. that no one can take it from you. For you have the faith. And you believe in me and in Him, from whom I was sent. Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe. who brings forth bread from the earth. Take! Eat! For this is my body. Do this in remembrance of me. Blessed are you, O Lord, our God. King of the Universe. who creates the fruit of the vine. Drink! For this is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for you. and for many. for the remission of sins. - I wish to see the High Priest Caiaphas. - It is late. He will see me. <i>So Judas Iscariot went his way.</i> <i>to betray Jesus</i> <i>to the chief priests and the captains.</i> <i>to say how Jesus and Barabbas.</i> <i>were the left and the right hands</i> <i>of the same body.</i> <i>Thus Judas thought</i> <i>to test and prove forever.</i> <i>the divine power of the Messiah.</i> <i>Then Jesus went forth</i> <i>to the Mount of Olives.</i> <i>and the garden called Gethsemane.</i> <i>there to await the dark night ahead.</i> <i>there to consider the dark days to follow.</i> <i>there to prepare for his trial and his death.</i> Keep watch and pray! Why must we wait? What can I say? "Father, save me from this hour? " It is for this very reason that I am coming to this hour. My Father. My Father. All things are possible to you. Take away this cup from me. And yet. not as I will. but as You will. You were with the man Jesus. You are wrong, woman. I do not know the man Jesus. Are you one of the disciples? No, I am not. - How long will Jesus be in there? - I don't know. You're a disciple. I saw you in the olive grove. I am not. I was not in the olive grove. I could swear you were with this man. I do not know what you are talking about. I am not a follower of this man. You have been interrogated by Caiaphas. They've judged you guilty on two counts: Blasphemy and sedition. This court takes no cognizance of your blasphemy. But the charge of sedition is a major offense. The rules of Roman law will prevail. I, Pontius Pilate, Governor of Judea. by grace of Emperor Tiberius of Rome, will judge your case. No matter what you've done up to now, no matter what others accuse you of. I, and I alone, have the authority. to sentence you to be crucified or flogged. or to set you free. How you conduct yourself here will determine your fate. Do you understand? I am offering you an opportunity to state your defense. Silence can only serve to militate against you. I'm now offering you a second opportunity. In view of the continued and obstinate silence of the accused. the court appoints Lucius Catanus Advocate of the Defense. I wish it emphasized in the record that the accused has representation. I cannot undertake your defense unless you are willing to confide in me. Does the accused desire to confer with his advocate? The trial will proceed. For the benefit of the accused. so that he comprehends the gravity of his case. I request the charge against him be repeated. The defendant is accused of claiming to be a leader sent by their God. to liberate the Hebrew nation. The accused, by neither deed nor word, has ever challenged Rome's jurisdiction. During the past three years, the accused has in acts and speeches. disturbed the people. condemned the payment of tribute, and claimed himself king. And spread the word that his kingdom. has precedence over and above Roman jurisdiction. The defendant has only spoken of the Kingdom of God. He's never attempted to usurp Roman jurisdiction over Judea. The implication is the same. There can be no division of authority in Judea. A nation can have only one master. I repeat, my lord. The defendant's claim to a divine mission. does not challenge the authority of Rome. The performance of miracles is beyond the jurisdiction of this court. The accused does not stand trial for miracles. but for setting up a kingdom. Advocate for the Defense will confine his argument to the issue. The charge is a secular issue. By treaty with Judea, Rome obligated itself. not to interfere in religious matters. The court is fully aware of this evidence. The court is also aware of the unlawful assembly. the accused created with his Sermon on the Mount. I was present at that sermon. I submitted a report of his statements. Not once did he speak a word that would incite violence. On the contrary, he spoke only of peace. The court has also read the report of the sermon. He advised people to dispose their possessions and follow him. How can Rome levy taxes on the people if they follow his teaching? Then the charge should be reduced to one of evading the tax. The charge stands as read. Are you a king? It is your own lips that have called me King. My kingdom is the Kingdom of God. Then you are a king. I was born and came into this world to give testimony to the truth. Whoever believes in the truth will listen to me. What is truth? Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. Different people have different feelings. Can there not be more than one truth? There is only one truth, and it is written in the Commandments: "Be true to God." My lord, the court deviates from the issue. Truth is not on trial here. but a man named Jesus, from Nazareth. Nazareth. You are a Galilean, then? In that case, Herod Antipas has jurisdiction over you. He just returned to Jerusalem. Send him to Herod Antipas. My lord, please. Herod is prejudiced against this man. He could not be tried fairly there. It is so ordered by this court. The trial has ended. Caesar is satisfied. Are you John the Baptist, come back to life? Can you not see he is not John the Baptist? Let him speak for himself! I have heard you are a very great miracle-worker. I'd be very happy to witness a simple demonstration of your power. Here is a vase of clay. It's only a small vase. Turn it into gold. Surely that is not a great feat for a man of your powers. Still made of clay. Perhaps it was too difficult for you. Shall I ask of you something simpler? Make it thunder. Should be very easy for a messiah. Make it thunder. I hear nothing. It seems the great miracle-worker has lost his touch. Do not let it be said Herod does not know how to receive royalty. Does he not look like a king? Take this faker back to Pilate. Tell him Herod was not pleased with his performance. Scourge him! Loosen his tongue. Make him confess. What would you want him to confess, Pilate? - His conspiracy. - What conspiracy? Take the miracles. What is his crime there? He is different and refuses to behave like the others. If he can influence even Caesar's daughter, he is dangerous. What do you want? A king should wear a crown. If only the sun would set quickly. What difference does it make? Passover begins at sunset. They cannot crucify us during the holy days. I would rather get it over with today. How does it feel to be about to die, Barabbas? I only object to the company that I will have to keep. We are only thieves. You're a murderer. It is we who should object to your company. Let him be. So, I have been given the honor of going last? You know the man named Jesus, from Nazareth? I know the man. Does he deserve to die? No more than I. You compare yourself in the same breath? We both seek the same thing. Freedom! Only our methods differ. The freedom he spoke of is not the same you killed for. When is the man Jesus to die? He carries his cross now. Why do you tell me all this? Why don't you take me with him? Get it over with. Go. You're free. The man Jesus is dying in your place. One prisoner is freed each year at this time. Pilate offered that mob a choice. Me? They chose me? Your followers yelled the loudest. Go. Look at him who is dying for you. You. Cyrenaican. Take the cross. Do not weep for me. That man is dying in my place. Why should he do that? I never did anything for him. Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do. If you are the Messiah. then save yourself and us. Have you no fear of God? We are guilty! But this man has done no wrong. Remember me, when we have come into the glory of your kingdom. I promise. you will be with me. this day, in paradise. Woman. behold your son. My God. My God, why have you forsaken me? It is finished. Father. into Your hands I commend my soul. He is truly the Christ. <i>And the body of Jesus</i> <i>was begged from Pilate, and given over.</i> <i>And in the place where he was crucified,</i> <i>there was a garden.</i> <i>And in the garden a new sepulcher,</i> <i>hewn from stone.</i> <i>And Jesus was placed there.</i> Sir! Sir, have you hidden him? Tell me where, and I will take him away. Woman, why do you weep? Because you have taken away my Lord. I know not where. - Magdalene. - Master! Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my disciples. Tell them I ascend to my Father and your Father. To my God and your God. But first, I go before them into Galilee. There shall they see me. He is arisen. <i>And when the tomb was found empty,</i> <i>some days passed.</i> <i>and Christ was seen at Emmaus</i> <i>and in Jerusalem.</i> <i>And those who saw him</i> <i>knew he was the Lord God.</i> <i>And then a final time he came</i> <i>among his disciples.</i> <i>by the shore of Galilee.</i> <i>Do you know and love me?</i> <i>Feed my sheep,</i> <i>for my sheep are in all the nations.</i> <i>Go you into all the world</i> <i>and preach the Gospel.</i> <i>to every creature who hungers.</i> <i>I am with you always.</i> <i>Even until the end of the world.</i> English <i>From all German stations,</i> <i>including those of</i> <i>the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,</i> <i>the General Government,</i> <i>the Brussels Two</i> <i>and Luxemburg stations,</i> <i>and the Paris station.</i> <i>In the Night Concerts series,</i> <i>the Deutsche Rundfunk presents</i> <i>the Seventh Symphony</i> <i>by Ludwig van Beethoven,</i> <i>conducted by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler.</i> Warsaw, early August 1944 DIPLOMACY <i>Europe was consumed by war.</i> <i>We were all going to die.</i> <i>After the Landings,</i> <i>the Allies marched on Paris.</i> <i>The Germans planned to destroy,</i> <i>to raze everything.</i> <i>Especially Paris.</i> <i>Nothing was to be left standing.</i> <i>The F√ºhrer's orders.</i> Paris, the night of August 24-25, 1944 Here's your coffee. You haven't slept all night again. Morning, Maryse. Tell Mayer to bring me my uniform and boots, please. But it's 4 a.m. Do as I ask. Morning, sir. Morning, Mayer. General, you're standing against the light. Not even a child would miss you. Children are asleep at this time. Come inside. Please. What's that, Mayer? Looks like a man taking his dog for a walk. Such arrogance! The Parisians think we're finished. Mayer, pills! Quickly! - Should I call Dr. Fischer? - No. Take long, deep breaths, sir. Are you ready? Yes, sir. Alfred has the car ready. But, General. It's not a favor I'm asking you, it's an order. Take that letter to my wife. Tell her I was only doing my duty. Chocolates. For the children. General, your telegrams. Okay, fine. The enemy broke through our defenses last night. Reinforcements? That's fine, thank you very much. Mr. Lanvin? This way, please. Why that way? The General's orders. They're near Soissons, 3 hours away. The roads are minefields. They'll be here at noon, if there's no more sabotage. The enemy's only 2 hours away. Gentlemen. If Paris falls, all of France falls. And the Americans march on Germany. There's no other choice left to me. The explosion will be heard in Berlin. And 50 years from now, too, I bet. Well, sir? What are you going to do? My duty. You can rely on me. I know. I have faith in you. Thank you, Mayer. But as the French say, you only die once, but you stay dead a long time. Don't delay, get out of the city. Rest assured. I'll be in Baden-Baden tonight. Drop by Caf√© Karl. Eat a pretzel for me. Alfred! For the General's wife. Have a good trip. What is it? - You must leave. - I know. Just a moment. It's pointless. The fun is over. I can't go out without my eyes. Mr. Lanvin. Good morning. Major Ebernach and the French engineer are here. Have them wait a moment. The General's orders are to dig in in Paris. We'll give the enemy hell. We'll fight street by street to the last bullet. That way, we'll hold them up a while. They won't be in Germany anytime soon. - I'll take that. - Fine. What took 40 minutes in Kowel will take longer in Paris, but afterwards there won't be a stone left standing. Sorry for making you use the backstairs. I'd rather not alarm the staff or our troops. Suits me. I won't boast about this. Your expertise will be very useful to us. You know, I regret. Spare me your qualms. I have my own. Of course, he didn't help us voluntarily. But, as he's the expert, I suggest he explains personally. Lanvin, you have the General's attention. All right, then. The bridges. 33 of them, in all. And a dozen more on the outskirts. All rigged with explosives. Except the Pont Neuf, right here. It's the oldest. It will allow you to cross between both banks and to use the island as a stronghold. Blowing up the bridges will cause the Seine to burst its banks, like in the flood of 1910. Rubble will dam the river. All of south-eastern Paris will soon be under water. Le Marais, first. Then, the flooding will spread to Nation and Bastille. Probably 3-4 meters deep in places. That means no electricity, no sewerage, nothing. Buildings and streets will collapse. We don't need explosives in this area. The Seine will do the job for us. Go on, Mr. Lanvin. Five minutes after the bridges, Notre-Dame cathedral. the Louvre. and the Opera will in turn explode. Taking the city center with them. Nothing will be left. And the stations? Of course, the stations. Debris from Orsay Station will help block the Seine. Likewise, the destruction of the other stations, Austerlitz, Lyon, Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est and St. Lazare, will paralyze the right bank. If I'd been told as an Architecture student that one day I'd blow up Paris. Humanity is resilient, Ebernach. Outside Sevastopol, to prepare your attack, I had no hesitation in blowing up the old fort. Ebernach, in Sevastopol, I had to carry out the hardest order of my career, the liquidation of the Jewish population. I obeyed that order and accepted all the consequences. I know. We dug the mass graves. And we filled them in. Today, it's Paris! Three tons of cheddite around Place de la Concorde. Four tons in parliament and the basement of Les Invalides. And 4 submarine torpedoes on each leg of the Eiffel Tower. The Arc de Triomphe will blow with Place de La Concorde to clear a line of fire along the Champs-Elys√©es. That will take 20 minutes. And then, believe me, Paris will be unrecognizable. Good work. The Parisians will remember you. If there are any left. What's your estimation of casualties? It's hard to escape from hell. The current population's around 1.5 million. That's not too bad. Tell your men to be ready. They are. One of my platoons is checking the time-switches. It'll take 15-20 minutes. Then the platoon leader will call you. His name? 1st Lieutenant Hegger. Where is he? I'd rather tell you that in private. Bressensdorf. Keep an eye on Mr. Lanvin. Don't let him go anywhere. Yes, sir. Where is he? At the parliament building, the Assembl√©e nationale. General, my task is complete. I request permission to leave Paris with my unit. What? You want to go? With your permission. 1st Lieutenant Hegger will lead the operation. I've known him since Ukraine. I fully vouch for him. We are needed elsewhere. Immediately after France fell, the F√ºhrer visited Paris, to show his architect, Speer, the city he admired most, especially the Opera, his favorite monument. They went around it twice. So why destroy it? Hitler wanted Berlin to be as beautiful as Paris, and bigger. Now, four years later, Berlin is in ruins, while Paris is as glorious as ever. See? It's unbearable for him. Even if it serves no strategic purpose, Paris must be flattened, especially the Opera. Choltitz. Berlin? I'll hold. I was cut off. Put me through to Berlin, will you? Morning, General. Consul? I'm not interrupting, I hope. I didn't hear you come in. To be honest, I didn't knock. May I? The stairs are pretty steep. I thought you'd left Paris. How did you get in here? Your hotel is admirably located in the heart of the capital but. You have no idea of its history. Of this suite, in particular. What are you trying to say? I didn't come through the lobby. Nor through that door. I know, very rude, and not a habit of mine. I needed to see you unseen. Explain, Mr. Nordling! I hate riddles. In Paris, every hotel has its secrets. The Crillon, Ritz, and the Meurice. When you moved in, you had 200 rooms to choose from. You took the only one with a false bottom. A false bottom? Have you ever heard of Elisabeth Aryet? - Who? - Elisabeth Aryet. And Miss Howard? Never mind. They are one and the same person. Miss Howard was her stage name. It's an old story but still very juicy. Around 1860, she took numerous minor parts in plays, and some evenings, lovers to her bed. One of her lovers lived not very far from here, over the road in the Tuileries Palace. He was Napoleon III. In France, power and affairs of the heart don't mix, especially involving an actress. But he was fond of her, so he moved her in here. And to ensure greater discretion, he issued orders to build this staircase. A bit steep, I grant you. It leads not to the entrance guarded by your men on Rue de Rivoli, but Rue du Mont-Thabor. The Emperor merely had to cross the Tuileries, walk up the stairs and into the arms of. Miss Howard. France was none the worse for it. Hans! You two, go down to Rue du Mont-Thabor. - What number? - There is no number. Where is it? Is this necessary? I doubt Napoleon III will drop in. Where is it? The steel door on the corner of Rue de Castiglione. The corner of Rue de Castiglione. You, follow me. Check this staircase is secure. There are 2-3,000 terrorists out there, who'd happily spit on my corpse. Did I not release all political prisoners? The last were freed yesterday. So, what now? I came to suggest you put an end to all this. Your so-called terrorists are patriots. I respect enemy combatants, but they are Bolshevik criminals, and I will crush every last one of them! Kill one and you create two more. That depends on the resources we deploy. I was sent to Paris to restore order. I shall do much more. What will you do exactly? Nothing special. The stairs lead down to the street. I was cut off. It's urgent, take care of it. - What's going on? - No time. Choltitz isn't finished yet. If you saw him at Kharkov. I was there. You too? To think that barely two weeks ago, Paris was the dream posting for a German soldier. The most docile, disciplined territory in the whole of Nazi Europe. An officer posted here knew he had left the war behind and would want for nothing. The only battles to be fought here were to obtain the best table in a restaurant. The Parisians are cowards, Mr. Nordling. They skulked in their homes for four years. The enemy's Normandy landings brought some out, and now they start to attack us, to defy us, killing dozens of my men. I shall make them pay. With no distinction between terrorists and the others. I advise you to leave the city forthwith. It's not your war. Leave Paris no less? And go where? I have no idea. Back home, I suppose. Back home? This is my home. You can't say the same. Pardon me? We're foreigners. I'm Swedish, you're German, but I was born and lived all my life in Paris. You've been here barely two weeks. So what? I know these men and women. They won't leave you in peace. They've sacrificed theirjobs, comfort and families. They'll die for their cause. Same here, Mr. Nordling. This is war, not a pleasure cruise. Indeed. But you have 2,000 men. And on the other side? 3 million. One day very soon, they'll make short work of you. Who? The French? Short work of us? You claim to know them? You're a diplomat, I'm a soldier. Spare me your advice. 3 million civilians, what's that? Nothing! It's bluster! I'll swat them aside like flies. Governor, two armored divisions strike for Paris, as we speak. Two Allied divisions. We both know it. You must face facts. Two divisions, that's 30-40,000 soldiers you cannot hope to beat, who will enter the city shortly to fight alongside its population. What will you do then? You think the enemy is alone on the road to Paris? Fear not, reinforcements are coming. Four SS Panzer divisions left Denmark six days ago. You mean the 4 divisions stuck since yesterday near Soissons? Surely not. You're expecting others. My time is precious. Come to the point. As you wish. My embassy was contacted last night by the French general whose divisions are headed your way. He told me, or rather asked me, to give you this letter. A letter? From a French general? Interesting. You know this general, then. I've heard of him. Everybody has. - You've never met him? - Not yet. So, why your embassy? I suppose he was told that we'd met frequently in the last few days, that I'd been the go-between for the political prisoners, and that we are on good terms, you and I. On good terms? We are, aren't we? Perhaps he simply thought that representing a neutral nation would make my task easier. That's why you're here? To deliver that letter? Who are you working for, Mr. Nordling? I beg your pardon? Who are you working for? A general you hardly know wakes you one night, and you come running? If I can help create a climate. Naturally. Well, give me the letter. I am not in the habit of corresponding with an enemy general before hostilities have ended. You can take that back. That's exactly what I told him. If I were you, I'd have read it first, if only out of curiosity. Pointless. Tell this jester I do not accept ultimatums. It is exactly that. You're very sharp. No, it's simply usual practice in the circumstances. It's usual practice? I'd no idea. And your duty is to reject it? That's usual practice? No, I have my orders, and I never question an order. Of course. Otherwise, you wouldn't be a general. What if an order is absurd? I have never received such an order. Never? Never. You can't defend Paris with 2,000 men. It's impossible, as you know. General Leclerc guarantees honorable surrender for you and Germany, with only two conditions. One, you surrender without a fight. Two, you return Paris as you found it. In other words, intact. That's all. Think about it, General. Have you finished, Consul? I beg your pardon? Hans! Get me Bressensdorf. I'd ask you to leave now. Don't argue. Leave! What do I tell General Leclerc? Tell him he'll remember today. Ensure Mr. Nordling reaches his embassy safely. Yes, sir. Choltitz. What is it, Lieutenant? What? Hold on. I asked you to leave, Mr. Nordling. Follow me. That's Lt. Hegger, I suppose. Pardon me? I fear he doesn't have good news for you. Here, I'll leave you this, just in case. It's a copy of the letter you ripped up. Wait, Bressensdorf. Yes, Lieutenant, go ahead. The detonator mechanisms have been sabotaged. Sorry? <i>How much damage?</i> I can't say yet. Out, Bressensdorf! Consul Nordling stays with me. Very good, sir. How much time do you need? Do what it takes. You have ten minutes. <i>Not a second longer.</i> What about the Resistance men? Yes, sir. I'll keep you informed. Load. Take aim. Fire! It appears I was letting you go too soon, Consul. There was more. How did you know? Pardon me? That Lt. Hegger would call. I'm a diplomat. I love listening at doors. By the way, Caf√© Karl ran out of. pretzels long ago, you know. Rationing. Corporal Mayer won't be happy. How long were you at that door? Impressive, these chess pieces. They add a dimension to your map. Look at me when I talk to you. What do you know? Who tipped off the terrorists? What terrorists? Don't play dumb now. Lt. Hegger's work was sabotaged. How unfortunate. I haven't a clue. How did you know he'd be delayed? His unit's location was known only to myself and Ebernach. I had no idea. I'd advise you to stop this. In your own best interest, answer me. I thought I was answering you. How long have you spied on me for France? I don't work for France. Who then? Britain? America? You accord me too much importance. My initiative is strictly personal. You think I'm stupid? If I may, I'd rather not answer that. Turn around. I haven't finished. Just a moment, while I bring this up to date. Stand clear of that map! I'll tell you what happened. You did come up those stairs, but not alone. You had an accomplice, one of the terrorists. You both hid behind the door, until you had the information you came for. Then, the other man went to inform your friends. And you entered in order to buy some time. You knew I wouldn't be easily dissuaded, that a minor French general's letter wouldn't change my mind. Unless my operation was sabotaged, leaving me no alternative but to negotiate. Well? Is that it? Admit it. Do you know what we do to men like you? Give them a medal? Yes, on occasion. Posthumously. You forget one thing, Governor. One small detail. Supposing I were in collusion with the Resistance, and with my knowledge of the staircase's existence, do you think you would still be alive? In two weeks, if I'd wanted to bring in armed men, I'd have had no lack of opportunity. Especially, tonight. Sweden is a neutral country, Governor. It has maintained its neutrality throughout two world wars. I have no wish to change that state of affairs. In that case, what are you doing here? I came here for that. So your children see that, too, one day. Dawn over Paris. - Stand back from the balcony. - Sorry? You could signal to your men. - Please! - Stand back. How can I prove to you. Don't argue. Stand back! How old are your children? Leave my children out of this. You can answer without fear of betraying a secret. My girls are 14 and 8, and my boy's 4 months old. Four months? Congratulations! When I was 8, like your younger daughter, I often wondered how a name as simple as Paris could represent all the things visible from your balcony. All these streets, houses, plazas. All the squares, too. I couldn't see how so many things and so many people could fit in a city whose name was so short. Why do you insist on destroying the city? It's none of your business. Wrong. If I hadn't been asked to contact you, I'd be asleep, oblivious, like all these people you'll soon kill. Can you stop your histrionics? They are civilians, caught up in an absurd war, innocent of any action against you. What does a life mean to you? What is a life? Of those about to perish, how many children like yours? Be quiet! You sneak in like a thief and lecture me in morality? Allow me to remind you of something. One year ago, from July-August '43, to be precise, your friends dropped over 10,000 tons of bombs on Hamburg. 10,000 tons! Most were phosphorus bombs. You know what that means? Anybody who wasn't shredded or incinerated died of suffocation with their throat and lungs on fire. They were civilians. Women, children, old folks. None of them had fought in battle. How curious that you never protest when the civilians being killed are ours? You are misinformed, General. My embassy and I have always denounced such actions from all sides. Not with the ardor you display today. Definitely not! By that logic, the Allies destroying a city gives you the right to destroy one, too. Correct? Unless, of course, you are merely looking for excuses. Excuses? I won't believe you have no misgivings? Believe what you want, Mr. Nordling. My conscience is clear. Paris will suffer the same fate as Mannheim, Hamburg and Berlin. We'll all have our martyrs. Now you know. It makes you a criminal. - A criminal? - Absolutely. The pilots who bombed Hamburg, we'll never know their names. But you give the orders. You'll be remembered as the man who destroyed Paris. How does that make me a criminal? The annihilation of a city outside a combat zone is a criminal act. Yes, we agree there. Paris, as far as I know, is not in any combat zone. That's correct. Or it was, until last night. At 03:10 exactly, your general breached our outer line of defense. By attacking our bases, he broke his city's neutrality. He is a direct threat to it. As Governor of Paris, I am sole in charge of our response. You see a crime, Consul? I see only an act of war. The Allied advance allows you to raze the city? It's clearly the best riposte I can give them. With no concern for relations between France and Germany? What relations? The bond between neighboring peoples. Don't delude yourself. By destroying Paris, you demolish any future bilateral relationship. We're not at that stage yet. Of course we are. It's your duty to consider the future. My duty? As a German and human being. You're quite wrong! My duty is to lead my men to victory, by all means possible. Everything else is absolutely irrelevant. Frankly, I don't understand you. You can't let this happen. Paris doesn't belong to you. When will you stop seeing Paris as a French city? If the Parisians had defended it, or even burned it! As the Russians burned Moscow to stop Napoleon. But no! They gave it to us, legs wide open, like a whore. The city is ours. We do with it as we please. Paris belongs to no one. Are you here as Swedish consul or mayor of the city? Neither. Tonight, I am simply Raoul Nordling. Fine. Now listen to me very carefully, Mr. Raoul Nordling. I'll be very clear with you. You won't make me change my mind. I have received orders, I will obey them. - At the cost of thousands of lives? - Absolutely. - And an irreplaceable city? - Yes. Meanwhile, I'll keep you here. Then, I advise you to leave this city as fast as possible. There. I have nothing more to say. I was wrong. I was wrong about you, General. And about myself. I was sure I could dissuade you from doing something so crazy but. I clearly overestimated my capabilities. So, we'll never see that dome again. No more Louvre, no more Place de la Concorde. No more children playing in the parks. No more towers of Notre-Dame. Everything must go. Forever. And you have no remorse? No. What kind of man are you? All for what? You know destroying Paris is pointless. It's gratuitous. Purely gratuitous. Germany has lost the war. You've lost too. What are you talking about now? Don't pretend otherwise. You fought in Russia, Italy, Normandy. You're looking down the barrel. On all fronts. Sooner or later, the Allies will reach Germany and then what? The Red Army is in Poland, headed for Romania and Hungary. You'll be surrounded and it will be all over. Look out there, look at the city, and tell me if it's worth it. It's out of the question. You'd rather not look reality in the eye? Whose reality? Yours or mine? The reality that destroying Paris is absurd. Yours then. Not mine alone. The world is watching you. In the end, you, General Dietrich von Choltitz, will be held responsible. All for what? To delay the Allied attack on Germany for a few weeks? It makes no sense. I understand that you have your orders and must obey them. But surely, at some point, obedience ceases to be a duty. In your whole career, have you never had a doubt or even. a hesitation over the legality of an order? Even if that were the case, I have no right to incite uncertainty among my men through my own insubordination. A general at the front must be a model for his troops. Hans. Wire this to HQ. What about my call to Berlin? The blast should blow the bridge away, like a cyclone. As it's steel, we need to add 30 kg of explosives. Right there and there, where they intersect, okay? - Is the damage fixed? - Changed and checked. Line, please! Communications still down. Shit! I'll try from the roof. You remind me of Abraham. Who? Abraham, in the bible. When God orders him to kill his son, Abraham obeys. He sharpens his knife, builds an altar, raises his arm to stab Isaac, never expecting God to intervene at the last. How can one justify doing that? By claiming he was doing God's will or feared His wrath? But that misses the point, which is, what child would want a father like that? If not for its beauty or people, save Paris for you, your soldiers and Germany! For Germany? Believe me, if you destroy Paris, it will be a disaster for Germany. The repercussions of such a crime go beyond the war. Germany will be made an outcast. Your children and those of the survivors will wear the swastika in their flesh. Just as others currently wear yellow stars. You certainly are a fine talker. Abraham. A Jew. It's an interesting analogy. I no longer believe in God, but I remember the bible well. In fact, you're asking me to betray the oath I took to serve my country. You're asking me to betray my whole upbringing. My father was a soldier. My grandfather was also a soldier. My ancestors fought Napoleon in his Russian campaign. And I have been in two wars. Let me finish. I saw everything in those wars. The intoxication of victory and the humiliation of defeat. I, too, want this one to end, the sooner the better. But I will never capitulate. If Hitler told you to kill your little boy, you wouldn't hesitate? Like Abraham, 4,000 years ago? You're becoming insolent. You hardly leave me any choice. - We're here to see the General. - Follow me. We bring a message from Heinrich Himmler. Very well. I'll inform the General. Where's the. Kitchen? Eat? Nothing left, can't help you. Show us anyway. Your boys, all gone. Show me! What's the plonk? It's the last bottle we have. Cider. Open it up! It's from Normandy. Get it open, I said! Give it here. Gentlemen. We've come from Berlin. Crossed through the lines. An absolute miracle! On an important mission from Himmler. Concerning? The destruction of Paris. You must assign to us a reconnaissance unit. That's the Louvre, is it? Across the street? Himmler wants a few artworks for safekeeping. You came all this way from Berlin? Where'd you get the fuel? What do you care? We commandeered it. From fighting units? From chickens fleeing the enemy. Men you allowed to leave the city, cowards incapable of defending it. The Bayeux Tapestry, some paintings by Rubens, two Caravaggios, rolled up, without frames, so they fit in the trunk. And the Mona Lisa? Himmler only wants those. Gentlemen, I think you have arrived too late. You refuse to obey Himmler. St√ºpnagel, your predecessor, will be hanged today in Berlin, from a meat hook. His wife and children will pay for his crimes also. I bet Paris is full of conspirators like him. The blue blood club. - Any news from Hegger? - No, sir. It must be working now. And get those guys off my back. Lieutenant. Thank you. Gentlemen, Paris is one huge time-bomb. In a few minutes, it will explode. All the bridges, Notre-Dame, Invalides, the Eiffel Tower. My wife wanted a postcard of it. That's all that will be left. May I? Of course. Do you like it in Paris? It's better than Russia. Where were you? In the Kharkov cauldron with General von Choltitz. Do you know what Sippenhaft is? What? Sippenhaft. Do you know what it is? No. It's a law, decreed just before I arrived in Paris. I'm overjoyed. Shall I tell you what the law says? Since two weeks ago, all German officers' families are considered hostages. They answer for our actions. If Paris doesn't blow up, my wife and children will be arrested, incarcerated and executed. You find it hard to believe? Here. The decree signed in person by Adolf Hitler. Germany is scared, Consul. To fight back, it resorts to the worst medieval practices. Blind, unconditional obedience. Enter! Gentlemen. The owner's private stock, from the cellar. Very good. Would you care for a bite to eat? Or a cigarette? We also have a camembert. Thank you. Miss. Gentlemen. I have destroyed a dozen towns in this war, mostly out of strategic objectives. I did so with absolutely no qualms, because it was necessary. I am aware that the destruction of Paris won't win us the war, but I love my children. My surrender sentences them to death and I doubt God will intervene to save them. By obeying orders, I save their lives. Were I to disobey, what child would want a father like me? Allow me to return the question. What would you do in my shoes? Pardon me? What would you do in my shoes? In your shoes? - Well. - Go ahead. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, including women and children. It's a simple question. What would you do in my shoes? You'd sacrifice your wife and loved ones for a city you hardly know? Well? Hold on. I need an answer. I need one now. What would you do in my shoes? Answer me, will you? Answer me! I don't know. Just as I thought. Enter! I've been sent by Colonel Jay. General, listen. Get out. Stand ready. We'll find a way. I told you, I won't surrender. Think of the consequences. The Americans are on the outskirts of Paris. Your wife can surely be. Put me through to Hegger. Yes, Hegger. At the parliament building. We'll find a way to get your family out. Baden-Baden is on the border. They could reach Switzerland via France. I know a group that will be able to help them. Corporal Mayer can drive them to Strasbourg and to the group I know. Tomorrow, they'll be safe. I can't get through to Hegger. The field telephone's dead. With the French engineer to guide you. It's just across the Seine. The parliament building. The parliament building, yes. <i>I must speak with him personally.</i> <i>Take a radio with you.</i> Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Watch out! Sniper! I can get them across the border, at no risk. One word from you and tomorrow they'll be in Switzerland. Why do you think Sippenhaft was decreed the day before I was posted here? A pure coincidence? No. It's a law aimed at me personally. My family can't leave Baden-Baden without the Gestapo after them. They'll be arrested, incarcerated and executed. It could be worse, couldn't it? They could be sent to the camps. Ravensbr√ºck. Are you familiar with that name? Believe me, in some cases, death is preferable. You did your duty by coming this far. Now, let me do mine. If you'd be so kind. The pill bottle. Sorry? The bottle in my desk. In the drawer. - Which one? - Near the phone. Hurry! - How many? - Two. Two pills. Here. Breathe deeply. Long, deep breaths. Come with me. Drink this. Thank you. This is grotesque. I'm sorry. No, not at all. It's this damn asthma that. I've had it for years and with the heat, it. You should keep your pills on you. Thanks. How do you feel? Exhausted. Move! - Which way now? - This way. Can we trust him? You have a better idea? Forget the war a moment. Picture yourself in five years on this balcony. It's one day in the week, just another day. You hear the horns of tugboats coming up the Seine, glaziers and clothes merchants hawking their wares, a newspaper vendor shouting out headlines. You hear the swish of the broom bristles, scraping the sidewalk with a noise like an ocean tide. It's in the bold light of March, or misty November. It is Paris as you've never seen it, nothing like occupied Paris 5 years earlier. You come from Baden-Baden with wife and children and you think, I, General Dietrich von Choltitz, one day in August '44, might have put an end to this. But I didn't. What will you feel, do you think, at that precise moment? Generals often have the power to destroy, rarely the power to edify. Paris would owe its existence to you alone. Is that not worth all the glory due a conqueror? You are a fine advocate, but if I ever return and your capital is still standing, I'll be traveling alone. My wife and children won't be with me to admire your city. Why get me back on my feet? Pardon me? You came to my aid. I'd like to understand why. What's to understand? You could've let me choke to death. I am a diplomat, not a soldier, as you said. Death is not my business. Paris has only one ace in its hand to save it from destruction. You. The Nazis here would blow it up in a flash, but you're not like them. How would you know? You asked me what I'd do in your shoes. I'll tell you. For nothing in the world would I want to be in your shoes. It's not the destruction of a city but of millions of people. Until now, you have managed to keep intact your self-respect. If you carry out the orders of that tyrant, believe me, you'll lose it forever. General, should we get in position? What? The enemy's at the city gates. And Bressensdorf? He hasn't reported back yet. Thank you. Leave us now. Sir, there's only 20 of us here. And so? Should we set up defenses downstairs, on the roof or on this floor? How old are you? Eighteen. All men under 20 must leave the city. We're all under 20, except 3 or 4 of us. They stay with me and you others go. Yes, sir. Thank you. My men are scared. They're kids. It's not their war. It's no longer yours, either. It's that of a man alone, aging, fading, fooling himself and fooling others. A man reduced to blackmail, demanding inhuman obedience of his generals to commit crimes. Hitler. The man had a gift, you know. He had a gift for captivating you, giving you confidence and making you believe in Germany's historic destiny. And today? Today. Your superiors tried to assassinate him. Why? I can't imagine they attempted it for no reason. I played no part in their plot. You must have an idea. You knew them all. They weren't revolutionaries or fanatics. So why try to kill him? They were a step ahead. Sorry? They were in contact with Hitler. I wasn't. Two weeks after the assassination attempt, I was summoned to Rastenburg, Hitler's headquarters. I was ready to renew my trust, to continue to believe we had a chance. But the man I saw was absolutely not the man I once knew. He was slobbering at the mouth. His face was wracked with spasms and. The eyes. Those eyes. When I left Rastenburg, I had made up my mind not to obey his orders to the letter, to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. But since then, there is this ax over my children's heads. Today, I have no other way of saving them. Just one question. If you surrender Paris without resistance, what exactly will happen? Sorry, I wasn't listening. If you don't destroy Paris, what will be the consequences? A debacle? Something like that, yes. The frontline north of the Seine will be shattered, with the Allies free to strike at the Reich. And the immediate repercussions? What happens next? If Paris falls, how will Germany and the army react when they find out? With astonishment, at first. But soon it will be total panic. Panic? So, risk sending your family to Switzerland. The impact of your capitulation means your wife and children won't be Hitler's priority. That will give us a few days to act. If I capitulate, I'll be arrested immediately. How can I do anything then? Leave it all to me. To you? What guarantees do I have? You have two. First, Caporal Mayer. He drives your family from Baden-Baden to Strasbourg, on to Mulhouse, around the Jura, to Annemasse, in Haute-Savoie. Driving all night, they'll be there tomorrow morning. Why not go straight to Basle? It's closer, true, but the border's tightly guarded. From Annemasse, it's quicker and safer. No mountains to climb, the border's a formality. Your family will be in Geneva in no time. And that's where Chantecler is based. That group is your second guarantee. How far is Annemasse from the border? Under a kilometer. Altitude? 400 meters, at most. - No mountains to climb? - None. Your family won't be the first. It's not a difficult route. You'll go with them? Up to the border. I'll wait for confirmation they're in Switzerland. Chantecler? Never heard of that group. Thank God! Or your family wouldn't stand a chance. There's no risk, I promise you. I need to be sure. I require solid proof. I've already used their services twice before. You? To what ends? To help a French family, some time ago. And more recently. My wife. Your wife? I don't understand. My wife is Jewish, Mr. Choltitz. She lives in Lausanne now. In safety. I'd like to help you further but. I cannot put myself in your shoes. Lieutenant Bressensdorf! First Lieutenant Hegger? That's me. Are you ready? Sure. We just need the order. That's why I'm here. Guys, Paris gets its firework display! I need to confirm I'm here. Confirm? It only works up on the roof. To the roof, then. The General too. Fine. The General too. Who's he? My guide. Clear out! Listen carefully. Just a moment. That's my final order. Operation canceled. Paris won't explode. Shit! Dammit! We worked our asses off! 3 days and nights, without eating, shitting or sleeping! All for nothing? Not a chance. 3, 6 and 9, in position. Hegger! Yes, 2nd Lieutenant? Can it! In Annemasse, give her this. Engraved with our wedding date. She'll believe you. My loved ones are in your hands. Nothing will happen to them. I give you my word. Well. My career ends here. Everything will be fine. Being the man who didn't destroy Paris is a real credit to you. Let's have a drink, shall we? You have an excellent whisky tucked away in this cabinet. How do you know? Rest assured, I won't tell the Brits. You like it straight, don't you? You're a funny fellow, Mr. Nordling. Is there anything you don't know? About what, General? About me. You? I must make a confession. The mirror over the fireplace is a two-way mirror. Miss Howard was a flirt and Napoleon III was either as jealous as a tiger or a terrible voyeur, right? I'd say he was a terrible voyeur. And I'd agree with you. To the courtesan who led me to you. You're leaving? I think it's time. Wait! You need a safe-conduct or you'll never reach Annemasse. The German army still holds half of France. Excuse me. Hotel Meurice, yes. The French! A problem? No, it's Parisian humor, I suppose. A man asking to book a room tonight. You think they'll all take turns to call? Another reservation? No, that one wanted to see me dead. I fear he's in the majority. Hurry, you've no time to waste. Thank you, General. Church bells? Who are they burying at this time? I guess Paris is burying the Occupation. The bells announce the Allies' entry into Paris. So, they're tolling for me. Farewell, General. General. Mayer? We were stopped 20 km from here. I'm sorry. An enemy roadblock, impossible to get past. They opened fire on us. You have to get to Baden-Baden! You don't understand. They weren't there by chance. They were French and they were all over us. Without Alfred at the wheel, we'd be dead. The Resistance? Men. One last time, we must fight together. As a soldier among soldiers, I shall be at your side. My compliments. De Gaulle will speak at city hall. He wants you at his side. What's that? Shall we take the car? On a day like this? You're kidding? Let's walk! <i>General Choltitz was taken prisoner</i> <i>by the Allies and released in 1947.</i> <i>Thanks to the German debacle,</i> <i>his family was not arrested.</i> <i>Nordling and Choltitz met one more time.</i> <i>In Paris, in 1955.</i> <i>The diplomat gave the general</i> <i>the medal awarded to him after the war.</i> <i>Specially minted,</i> <i>this unique medal shows.</i> <i>Paris breaking its chains.</i> <i>Adapted from the play</i> <i>Diplomacy by Cyril Gely</i> <i>To the memory of my friend,</i> <i>Richard Holbrooke,</i> <i>whose diplomacy</i> <i>ended another war.</i> Subtitles by Simon John Subtitling: L.V.T. - Paris This film is the result of historical and journalistic research. Because of controversial gray areas in Carlos' life, the film must be viewed as a fiction tracing two decades in the life of a notorious terrorist. His relations with other characters have been fictionalized as well. Inspector Janda here! Attack at OPEC! Hands up! Turn around! You a cop? Youssef! The explosives! Now! Set them off only if I say so! Understood? Khalid! Find Yamani? Not yet. Dr. Hernandez Acosta. You can stand. Oil Minister of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister of Iran In the back, on the left. Faster! No talking! Move it! I don't get it. What is it? Someone's wounded. There are terrorists. Oil Minister of Algeria It's a serious wound. He needs to be operated immediately. Take him to the police. Send him to the hospital. Then come back. Do I have your word? You do. Are you a hostage? Don't move! Austrian Chancellor Home Secretary The terrorists have requested that the Libyan Ambassador mediate. But he's in Prague. The head of the commando shot a Libyan delegate. It seems Qaddafi is furious. The Iraqi charg√© d'affaires has offered to take his place. We have no choice. We must buy time and save lives. A DC9 will be ready at dawn. Keep the other countries informed. I am, but they¬íre at a standstill. The PLO made a statement condemning the raid. Only Algeria is willing to help us. I must speak with President Boumedienne. He's awaiting your call. <i>Know why Carlos is my nom de guerre?</i> No, I don't. For President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez. He nationalized the oil industry as well as the mines. He redistributed wealth to the needy. Considered education the 3rd world's main weapon. He's a revolutionary. His methods are. rather different from yours. Perhaps. I joined the internationalist struggle. But our convictions are the same. He's a man of peace with great respect for human life. So am I. Men of honour have nothing to fear. Only traitors need be afraid. What traitors? You know full well. Venezuela's role in OPEC is very clear. The role of the organization is to help 3rd-world countries in their development. Not to support imperialists in maintaining oppression. Relax. Only Amouzegar for Iran and Yamani for Saudi Arabia will have to pay. The others will be spared. <i>A group calling itself</i> <i>the Armed Wing of the Arab Revolution</i> <i>which is holding the OPEC ministers hostage,</i> <i>has prepared a declaration in French.</i> <i>Austrian radio will now broadcast</i> <i>the full statement released</i> <i>by the Armed Wing of the Arab Revolution</i> <i>of December 21, 1975..</i> <i>"It is now clear for everyone</i> <i>"that the crucial Arab cause</i> <i>"concerning the Palestinian question</i> <i>"and subjected to its consequences</i> <i>"is the object of a major plot</i> <i>"aiming to legitimize</i> <i>Zionist existence on our land</i> <i>"and to consolidate division, weakness</i> <i>"and dissension in the Arab world</i> <i>"and particularly</i> <i>"in the region neighbouring the occupied Palestinian territory</i> <i>"in order to allow the aggressive Zionist state</i> <i>"to execute its expansionist projects.</i> <i>"In addition to these manoeuvres</i> <i>"aimed at forcing Arab and Palestinian recognition</i> <i>"regarding its legality the Zionist state. "</i> Excuse me. I'm not Muslim and I'm famished. Don¬ít you think. what the revolution needs is money and not corpses? What are you saying? Your hostages are more valuable alive than dead. Know what, Dr. Hernandez? Let me be clear. I'm very well paid. I have nothing to gain by sparing these dogs. Understood? Enjoy your sandwich. <i>An agreement has been reached</i> <i>with the hostage-takers.</i> <i>Every Foreign secretary</i> <i>as well as the heads of state</i> <i>whom I personally consulted</i> <i>agrees to the measures we have taken</i> <i>with no restrictions whatsoever</i> <i>and is grateful to Austria.</i> <i>In exchange for the release of all OPEC employees</i> <i>residing in Austria</i> <i>and not only the Austrian citizens,</i> <i>currently held by the terrorists,</i> <i>the commando will be supplied with aDC9.</i> <i>Their destination?</i> Algiers. <i>President Boumedienne has generously offered to mediate</i> <i>in hope</i> <i>of bringing this to a close and saving human lives.</i> <i>We extend our thanks to him.</i> He's in an ambulance. On his way to the airport. We will not leave until he's on board. Understood? If we'd asked for a belly-dance, he'd have done it. Nada! It's ok. Control tower. They want to talk to you. They say we're authorized to land. And to use the President's spot. Excellent. Tell them we're very honoured. The Foreign Secretary, Abdul-Aziz Bouteflika, will negotiate the hostages' release. Nothing to negotiate. We free who we have to, we refuel and we leave. President Boumedienne will meet you in the reception room. He'll make you an offer. Those bastards! Algerian Foreign Secretary Keep away! Watch out the door. Would you really have killed me? I'd have saved you for last. Listen to me. And listen good. We're out of fuel. If we don't land, the safety of the hostages will be at risk. The safety of the hostages will be at risk. Austrian Ambassador to Libya I didn't expect to see you again so soon. I'm sorry to get you out of bed so late. So things didn't go as planned in Tripoli. The Libyans betrayed our cause. I don¬ít think your cause is ours. - Want one? - No, thank you. Castro's personal reserve. Our pilot is exhausted. And the plane cannot reach our destination. Give us a long-haul plane and we're out of your lives. The Saudis are our allies. The Iranians too. We cannot put their ministers' lives in danger. You put them in danger by refusing our conditions. If things go wrong, your life and those of your men are at stake. Touch one hair on Yamani's head on our soil. and you're all dead. Clear enough? Be realistic. The Saudis are too powerful. Not one country would risk helping you. You won't go to Bagdad. What has Tunisia offered? Nothing. What has Libya offered? Nothing. I offer an honourable way out that can even come off as victory. Yesterday I mentioned a certain sum. I'm sure the Saudis would double it. Can your cause, whatever it is, afford to spit on 20 million dollars? What guarantee? Algeria's word. You proved it worthless. Then that of the Bank of Algeria! If you agree, we'll open an account in the name of your group. The money will be wired within hours. My group must not be named. In your name, then. Work it out with Mr. Haddad. We know him well. He's discreet, wary of needless publicity. But definitely not indifferent to money. I'm glad to see you alive. I know what we owe the Algerian government. I'm glad we could help avoid the worst. But I was scared. South Yemen, a few weeks later Angie, shut up in front of Haddad. You know I'm right. We need his support and his money. Be strategic for once. Who are you? Just like anyone else. Is he upset? <i>An incredible operation by Israeli Defence Forces</i> <i>at the Entebbe Airport in Uganda.</i> <i>Just before midnight, 3lsraeliaircraft</i> <i>containing parachutists and soldiers</i> <i>landed on the airstrip where pro-Palestinian militants</i> <i>held the 105passengersandcrew</i> <i>of the Air France Airbus hijacked last week.</i> <i>The surprise attack lasted only an hour.</i> <i>In Entebbe, Israeli forces</i> <i>reportedly killed the entire pro-Palestinian commando.</i> East Berlin, Autumn 1976 Who are you meeting? That guy, Michel. Carlos, right? I don't know. You know the rules. No questions asked. German Revolutionary Cells Can I have a whisky? Angie? Anyone home? Who brought you here? Don't panic. I'm all alone. Why shouldn't I panic? No one knows I'm here. Right, no one. except your friends. Aren't I still a friend? I don't know. It depends. You told comrades from the June 2nd Movement you were starting your own group. To get them off my back. It's not true? They wanted me to buy weapons. That's not what I'm in this for. So join us! Carlos is leaving Haddad. Haddad fired him. Bagdad has a new government. They need us. They're willing to pay. And very well. Iraqi money doesn't interest me. I joined the armed struggle to attack the capitalist system. Not to spread terror. Understand? Not to be hired by the PFLP or Bagdad. The PFLP has been very generous with us. They help our struggle. We help theirs. You can keep believing that crap. I'm through. You know the rules. You must go back to Aden. You must obey the orders they give you. This is war. You're a soldier. You know it. I won't go to Aden. I'm not at war and I'll receive orders from no one. You know too much. Names. Places. Secrets. You could endanger the whole network. I know how it works. I'll stay hidden until I'm forgotten. I doubt Wadie Haddad would risk it. - He'll have you killed. - If that¬ís my fate. Angie! The cops are looking for you! Two people died in Vienna. Your picture was in every fucking paper! You're as good as dead. I'm no rat. I know. But cops have sophisticated methods. Torture. Drugs. If they want you to talk, you'll talk. You say you're my friend. I trust you. But if Haddad says to, you'll kill me with no misgivings. Right? That's why I'm no longer with you. And it's why, once you leave, I'll disappear. You'll never find me again. Check this out. Know what's inside? My revolver. And my resignation from the armed struggle. Do you give names? But I say what I know. About plans to attack 2 Jewish community leaders. If I shut up, I'll never forgive myself! Boni. Boni separated the Jews at Entebbe like in Auschwitz! I'm an enemy of Zionism. I've proved it. But anti-Semitism: count me out. I thought you were alone. Run. Anything to declare? Open the trunk. Two months later Head of KGB As you know, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a loyal ally of the Palestinian cause, of the Third World and of all revolutions. Our coffers are open, our advisors on hand, our soldiers ready to shed their blood. I know all of you. I've worked with some of you. You know me as well. The USSR is a fearsome enemy to those who betray its cause. For them, there is but one sentence: death. The Egyptian president, Anwar El Sadat, has benefited from our generosity for many years. His country has profited from the labours of Soviet workers. But he has turned his back on us. He is ignoring his huge debt toward us. He spits in our faces. He humiliates his country, the entire Arab world, all revolutionaries at war who are dying for our cause. He has bowed down before American imperialism and has become the manservant of the Zionists who occupy your holiest lands. He must pay the price. Today, in three months, in six months, in one year, if necessary. he will be held accountable. Bear in mind, gentlemen, whoever carries out the aforementioned sentence will benefit from our unlimited financial support. Let's hope for the best. There's a woman waiting for you. German Revolutionary Cells East Berlin, November 1978 It was quick. Leukaemia kills quickly. So does poison. <i>OPEC Terrorist Klein Resigns</i> Stasi Headquarters Section XXII of the Stasi Terrorist Group Interface Head of Section XXII Mr. Weinrich. How are you, my boy? Good, thank you. May I? since our last meeting, the situation is even tenser. <i>The Americans.</i> <i>have green-lighted the MX Missile Program.</i> <i>They're forcing the USSR to spend more on defence</i> <i>bleeding the soviet economy dry</i> <i>and creating international tension.</i> Good point, my boy. You're right about the intent of American imperialists, but it will only strengthen Soviet resolve and rally socialist countries, with East Germany at the fore. In our opinion the Eastern Block could use more commandos like ours to wage the fight at the vanguard. We do it for you and for 3rd-world countries. This is why we need your help. <i>We have official contacts and bases set up in Prague,</i> <i>Budapest and Sofia.</i> <i>The soviets let us transit weapons.</i> <i>Now we need you to give us permission</i> to setup a base in East Berlin. On one condition: you take no action in West Germany while transiting to and from base. Is that clear? Of course. I'll think it over. My deputy, Major Voigt, will inform you of my decision. Naturally, you have our sympathy and our friendship. Thank you. We've been informed of a plan to assassinate Sadat. It's not true. If ever you did consider it. I ask that you give up.

Can he sleep in my room? - I don't know if Uncle Ben wants to. Can I put this in the attic? I'll do that. (resistance paper) How is school? - It's closed. The law of the what? The lair of the beast. The lion's den. No, I can't help you. You know where they are. You can't ask me that. I bring a case of ration cards and you want them thrown in the river? You let your own people starve because you have to be neutral! Weakling. Michiel? Can you help me? No time. I have to go to Caesar. Hi Dirk. - Hi. Can I have a word? - No time, he has to go to Caesar. Sucker. Thanks for keeping your mouth shut yesterday. Did you get in trouble? - No, not much. Can you deliver this if I'm not back tonight? - Why shouldn't you be back? If I don't, take this letter to Bertus van Gelder. You can do that. - Not if it goes wrong. What are you going to do? Swear not to tell anyone. No one. We're taking out the ammunition depot at Lagezande. One, two. Let's try it. May I? What is it? - Soup! Can't you taste it? Watch out or I'll shop you to the Germans. Michiel. Come with your mother. Left turn backwards. Dad! Let me look. Now it's my turn. Why do they want the neighbours? You laugh with the Germans. Laugh? Wasn't Dirk here today? Did he say anything? No. He took part in a raid. The Germans were waiting for them. Two dead and Dirk's been arrested. Michiel. No. No, he didn't say anything. What a fuss. Theo's your best friend, isn't he? And do you know his brother Dirk well? It was pretty tough, wasn't it? You know what will happen to him now? If I notice you getting involved in the war, I'll knock your head off. Clear? Hey, Bertus. I have something for you. Dirk Knopper came yesterday. Ah, Michiel. Caesar need a new horseshoe, right front. End of the afternoon. - Can't you do it earlier? End of the afternoon. Schafter was first. Michiel! You heard about Dirk? - He's been arrested? I have to stay with Grandma. Mum thinks it's too dangerous. You're lucky with your dad. They won't harm you. Dagdaler Woods. Old hunting cabin. 60 m. East. He's been arrested. When I come back, I'll whistle this. No, Bertus just ran away. That was stupid. If you run, they're allowed to shoot you? - I mean he didn't have a chance. What shall we do? We can't just let this happen? Who's in the resistance here? - Not again, Ben. I can't help. You don't want to. You'd rather talk to Krauts. I want everyone to survive the war safe. If you know how, go ahead. But not in my village. "Your" village? You have no power. You proved that today. Michiel. Where did you come from? Where did you get that? Rule one in wartime: keep your mouth shut. Not hungry? - It's German. It might be poisoned. Uncle Ben. The Germans at the ferry drink tea every day at 3 o'clock. An acquaintance has to cross tomorrow. - I saiI all day. He has to cross at 3 o'clock. What do you have for me? What do you mean? As long as it's edible. Okay. See you tomorrow. You can have more later. That's Michiel, our youngest. Michiel, this is Aunt Cora and ehm Janneke. Janneke from Amsterdam. Will you cut some firewood? Michiel. Why do I always have to? She never does I'm already busy. You can do something. Michiel. Give me a hand. Hold that leg. I've seen Grandpa do it. But I'm making a mess. Watch this. Right. Hang it for a few days and we have a feast. With grateful thanks to the Nazis. - Meat is meat, Michiel. Or would you rather have soup again? .Jesus Christ and God the father. Great, we lost our room. I never heard of Aunt Cora before. But Hanneke? - Janneke. Hey! MichieI. Erika. Michiel, now I want to know where we're going. To a patient. - Who? I don't have time for your games. Michiel! - The less you know the better. Well. You're a long way from home. We ran out of wood. I'm going back. Look for someone else! Is there water and a bowl here? This is going to hurt. Come on, let's go. Yes. Of course. Does Dad know about this? - No, of course not! But he has to know. What if they find him? - They won't if you keep quiet. Michiel! - I take care of Jack and you shut up. More hot water? What d'you want of me? What are you up to? Hey, what did I tell you? You won't? - I didn't say that. I'll take care of it. What are you doing here? Jack is my patient. Jack is mine! I'll take care of him. - You want him to die? How is he? The fever has dropped. What are you going to do? - None of your business. If I can help. - Get lost, that helps. Come on. Hurry. The ferry leaves at 3 o'clock. "Bastard". - "Bastard"? Your sister is a reaI "bastard". Come on. Hurry. Michiel? Are you okay? Help lay the table. - It's Erica's turn. You can help though. How is Jack? The woods are full of Krauts! Is he safe? Where is Jack? I lost him. Van Beusekom speaking. Yes. Yes. Call me when you know more. They found a dead soldier. Where? - Dagdaler Woods. A German? - Yes. He'd been there for some time. Shot. Now they want the culprit. Michiel. What d'you know about that dead German? Nothing. You will be careful? If there's anything I can do. There's nothing. The package is on its way. We'll go to Zwolle when the Germans leave the woods. Tomorrow or maybe the day after. They found a German in the woods. Dead. What happened? Has he asked about me? What did you talk about? - Just things. I'll help you. Give me the razor. Try it yourself. Carefully. Don't cut yourself. Not too hard. And hold it at an angle. We have to do it differently. Dad. Look after yourself. I have to know. He's my husband! Where's Uncle Ben? There's no time to cry. Do something! - They won't say where he is. Michiel, please. We can't leave him, do something! - We don't know where he is. Vught, Amersfoort. Prison in Deventer. He's at the town hall. Here? In the village? Stay polite Michiel. That helps best. Good morning. I would like to see my husband. Van Beusekom. I'm sorry. I can't let you in. - I have brought clothes and food. Thank you. I'll make sure. - I want to give it to him myself. Please. I'm sorry. I really can't let you in. Stay there. I have to see my husband. - Impossible. He hasn't done anything. He hasn't! I know he hasn't done anything. Don't be so difficult! Johan! Johan! All I ask is to speak to him. Johan! Aha. The mayor's son again. I can't remember inviting you. Get lost! Well? Bomb the town hall. - Dad will like that. Then we have to attack. Come on! What else? We have to do something. We can't just leave him! I'll see what I can do. - I'll go with you. No. Stay with your mother. Look after her. Be careful. Uncle Ben. I'Il do my best. I promise. Uncle Ben. Mum, where is Erica? Mum? Erica! They're not. No. Dad will be free. Uncle Ben will help. All on his own? - Who says he is alone? Let's go home. Mum is alone. No. That's not necessary. You'll get shot. You die. He'll be freed tomorrow. I did all I could. Michiel? Right turn! Order arms. Let go of me. I know who did it. Are you coming? Michiel? Is he coming too? Of course. Then I won't go. - Michiel. It's his fault. It was the Germans. Not Uncle Ben. God save the Queen. Jesus. That's for Jack. He has to be moved, Michiel. I want to ask Uncle Ben. - No. Tomorrow he can take the ferry at 3 o'clock. That's safe. He has to go to Zwolle. Sorry. Michiel. Can we help maybe? Claus, you take the left. Push it under. One, two and push! Come on out. You have to help! He doesn't speak German. Ah! Schafter! Give us a hand! What's wrong with the wheel? - No idea how to fit it. Let me have a go. Lower it slowly. I decide when we go. Come on. Germans shot him. Not you. Sarah! Sarah! Inside, quick. British military, here in the shed? A kid from the RAF? He has to leave as quickly as possible. What's the plan? Michiel? Who's in charge? Me. You didn't involve anyone else? You don't know what you're up to, do you? From now on throw snowballs or bully girls. I'll take over. Erica, Jack's gone. Michiel. There are checks everywhere. Michiel. - What? Go on then! Bastard. Ah, here you are. Fortunately it's nearly all over. Dirk should never have used you. See you later. Okay? I never mentioned Dirk. In the Name of the German People. Michiel! - Bastard. Michiel, put it down. - "Dirk should never have used you. " I never mentioned Dirk. I didn't tell anyone. He told me about the raid. He was arrested. He also talked about Bertus. He was arrested too. Look, he works for the Germans. The Russians will be here soon. Then we'll see who's occupier and who's liberator. Michiel. Can have a cigarette? Where's that resistance of yours? Hey. Michiel. Michiel, I want to make a deaI. Let me go and I'll leave Jack alone. - Oh, just like Dirk and Bertus? Terrible things happen in all wars. - And Dad? I had your father free. Shut up! - Really. I arranged it. They'd take someone else at random. But your father refused. It was his choice. Think about it, Michiel. I'm a bastard, but I'm your uncle. I always protected you. Your father was going to help me. Stand up. Stand up. Germans. Mum! Michiel! Here you are. Why don't you go outside? Why don't you come to the party? You want a go?

You praise him, like these infidels? I have orders: flatter him until he bursts. Join in! I'll give you 5 dinars. Are you joking? This book comes from Baghdad! The Caliph would pay 1 00 dinars for it! He'd bargain with a wretch like you? I'll buy it. If I don't buy it for the Caliph's library, he'll slay me. I need it for my studies. I can barely afford it. For your studies? Then take it. It's yours. I'll let you have it for 7 dinars. All I have is five. You've earned it, wretch. Where can I find Averroes, the High Judge? He's my teacher. I'll take you to him. Wasting such blue eyes on a boy. how unfair! Eat! You're all skin and bones! There's enough for an army! She complains that I'm stingy but she feeds the whole neighborhood. If it weren't for me, you'd all look like him! Our eyes would turn blue? Don't take another bite. Manuela will put a curse on anyone who doesn't taste her biscuits. She's challenging me again? Go get my date bread. Just one bite and she'll turn green with envy. - Take it to her. - I'm no delivery boy! I'm the son of the Caliph! As modest as his father. Tell on me then, Uncle! If I were your father, I'd disown you! I'm going dancing! Unbelievable! The Caliph's son wants to be a dancer! We call this culture? At his age, I could dance for three days straight! Come to the inn, Blue Eyes, or they'll stuff you till you burst. I should stay. I'm warning you. they go to bed when the sun sets. Abdallah, you forgot these. I'll lock you in a dungeon filled with books! Finally. Is Your Highness sick? Do I have to be sick to see you? Let's play. - At this hour? - I can't sleep. I've been back from the war for four days. Where were you? What's wrong? It's my sons, Nasser and Abdallah. They're failures. You're finally thinking about them! They're vulnerable. What do you expect of them? What do you want them to be: thinking men or lackeys? I've run circles around the Spaniards. - We're talking about your sons. - You're obsessed! You're the one who's worried! All that interests Nasser is horses and girls. And Abdallah is beyond all hope. If I lock him in his room, he escapes. I threaten him. I even beat him, but it's hopeless. He slips away. Give him real responsibilities. You treat him like a mere servant. All he's good for is gypsy dancing. If you saw how he danced. Dancing! My son, a dancer! And what if he's happy dancing? When my daughter disagrees with me, she just blurts out: "You're wrong!" Instead of being our children's enemies, Iet's try to persuade them. Childish soul-searching pales in comparison with the reality of Conquest! Checkmate. All the better! You see? I'm unbeatable! Goodnight. Stay and learn to play. If I don't get to bed, I'll collapse. - You're like Abdallah! - We both love life! Don't. I'm scared. No. We want each other. It's simple. Get dressed. Help me to stay chaste. That's ridiculous. I'm hiding our relationship from Manuela. Lying to my own sister! Did you tell anyone? I want to tell the whole world! Abdallah loves Sarah. He's wild about her. Too bad she doesn't. No, I love you too. Terribly. Mere words. If Manuela finds out, she'll kill me. - She trusts me. - And you're betraying her. It's not my fault. It's the Devil. He's a naughty boy. a dirty little rascal. Every time we meet, I feel it's going to be the last. The son of the Caliph and a poor gypsy girl. You may think I'm strange. but that's just the way I am. Soad! At your service. They're staring at Abdallah. When you're a Caliph's son, people stare. You're worried sick, as if he were your own son. I'd take a son like him any day, faults and all! He's sulking. He won't speak to anyone. Get him to dance. He's dying to. The son of the Caliph? You're all out of your minds! He's had too much to drink. Quiet, please! I have a poem. Loving you is a slow death. My heart grieves. And when my torment becomes unbearable, I invoke my woeful heart and shout: "Why pine away for someone who ignores you? "Why care for so uncaring a creature? "You, prisoner of pride and vanity." Such depth in so few words. It's by Abu Nawas. It's amazing! You're so young. and already a genius! Stay with us a while. Share your learning with us. What does "prisoner of pride" mean? It's sort of what happens when your heart is sort of. It comes from deep inside. Sort of. I'm overwhelmed. I'll never attain your level of insight. Only a true thinker can appreciate such verse. You're a born poet. Every word you say is like. A pearl! A string of pearls! A Caliph's son mixing with commoners! You're modesty itself! People like you are rare. God keep you for your people. If only you could spend all night with us. The night is still young. We can wait. Hear me, lovers of life. Hearts are ablaze in the bonfire of love. If the moon hid itself, a thousand other moons would light up the night. They'd open the way for a thousand paths to the impossible. Even if you're late, rosy sunrise, source of life, we know you'll come back. You'll dazzle our eyes and brighten our souls, and you'll make us masters of our destiny. We'll dance as we please. And our dreams will dance deep in our hearts. Jezebel! We defy life with song. We defy life with song. Our hearts keep the beat. Our voices sing the tune. Our feet stomp to the rhythm. Make haste. The road we must travel is long. and we have no other. Every step we take is a burning torch guiding us on our way. We will not go astray. Dawn comes, lighting our way to a shimmering day. Dawn comes, lighting our way to a shimmering day. And if attacked, our dreams fight back. Resist! Fight! And vanquish! We must remain masters of our destiny. - Let's go. - Not without him. The Caliph's son? I have orders. They said: "Don't come back without him." - He'll slip away. - You think so? Here he comes. Poet! - Will you join us? - Why not? You won't be disappointed. Say you're sorry! Say it! How can l? You're gagging me! Hearts are ablaze. Let's go pray so God will forgive us for last night's excesses. What excesses? Dancing? I love dancing. Of course. Dancing is wonderful. You sway your head invoking the name of the Lord. Your soul follows the rhythm. O God, you command us and condemn us to silence. Let us be content with whatever you bestow on us. He who joins us will attain bliss and obtain redemption. He who spurns us will be forever damned. Obeying our Emir is our supreme desire. Obeying our Emir is our supreme desire. Bless us! Emir, bless us! Is anything wrong? No, I'm fine. A lazy fool learns two verses of the Koran and passes himself off as a purveyor of divine truth. Is this man pious? A true understanding of these texts requires years of reflection, research and labor. If we believe these self-proclaimed geniuses, we disregard this Koranic verse: "In the name of Allah the merciful: "The ignorant man, whose vain words lead astray from the way of God "and take it in mockery will be met by a humbling chastisement. "True is the word of Almighty God." No one can claim to know the whole truth. Not even Caliph Mansur? The lmam Malek said, pointing to the Prophet's tomb: "Every man can be questioned except for him who lies here." The lmam EI Chafei said: "A true opinion can seem false "and a false opinion, true." Averroes outsmarted him. Borhan is inept. Be patient. Borhan is craftier than you think. You'll see. The Koran is clear. Are you inciting us to doubt it? The Prophet said: "If your quest leads to truth, you will have two parts. "If it leads to error, one part. All quests are rewarded." "Lord, increase me in knowledge." Knowledge? What about faith? Are you contesting God? He outsmarted him again! Averroes said: "Revelation can be interpreted only by study." We should have answered: "The Text allows no interpretation." If you're so clever, answer him yourself and get your own flock of admirers. We have to silence Averroes. We must coerce the Caliph into forbidding him to teach. There's no use bickering. We'll take the necessary measures. "Be patient as the Messengers possessed of constancy." They leave the mosque one by one, pretending your lesson bores them. It's surely a ruse plotted by an invidious mind. I should "plot" a little song for them. Careful. Your song could cost you your life. What happened? Not now. Everyone, out! A pretty girl like you taking care of the laundry. And not of you? I'm ready and willing to help you discover the pleasures of this world. The nerve of you! Son of a Caliph or not, if you keep at it, I'll slap you! I'll throw you in jail and tickle you to death. Brute! He'll be on his feet in a week or so. For the time being, he needs to rest. Good going, Nasser. Removing the knife would have killed him. Did you see who attacked him? He was about twenty. with a crazed look in his eyes. - Why didn't you catch him? - And leave Marwan? Smart thinking! My horse kicked one of them in the face. I'd recognize the hoof-print. Do something or every philosopher will perish. Marwan, a philosopher? His songs belittle my father. It's your father's fault. He's giving the fanatics free rein. If I were in charge, I'd show you! I can just see you on the throne. Over there. Get off my "throne". Marwan! Shut the gates. I'm looking after my husband now! Understand? The security of the Almohad dynasty has never been so threatened. Where have you been, High Judge Averroes? And you, governor of Cordoba? And you, the crown prince? The country is foundering. After all we've done, who would dare protest? People are exploiting religion and you're letting them. They're the only ones we hear in the mosques. You'd be heard if you were as eloquent as these men of faith. Merchants of faith, if you ask me. Whether they rant on about Arab victories or about religion, they're only defending their interests. Stop philosophizing. We're talking about one man. - It's not. - Nasser! Find the assailant and have him executed. It's not a man, but a movement gnawing away at your authority. No movement in the world can shake my throne. These barbarians are jeopardizing our culture. What are you waiting for? Go execute my sentence. Have the assailant interrogated. He may tell us what's ailing our country. The country isn't ailing. It's in fine shape. The danger is real. They're a menace to the whole realm, not just Andalusia. They've indoctrinated thousands of young people. By magic? I think the assailant was manipulated by conspirators. Let the law decide. Show in the commander of the cavalry. In my opinion. You have opinions now? Opinions, positions. Convictions, too. A lot more than you think. Why not take my throne from me? Turn my people into a dance troupe! If my ideas bore you, I'll go elsewhere. Find a mosque and speak your heart out! Why not? I have a mouth. You do. It's a brain you don't have. God help you. - What? - God bless you. High Judge! Does he deserve to die? The Caliph's moods have replaced our laws. Go kill the boy. Obey your father's orders! His Highness demands blind allegiance. - Maybe I should. - You decide. If I were you, I'd think it over. Think hard. This is only the beginning! My son! My child! Why arrest him? Anyone could have done it! Where are you taking him? Did you attack Marwan because of his poems? - I've never read them. - Why then? If God lets me live, I'll stab him again. He's the enemy of God. - You didn't dress your wound. - It's a sin. Who told you Marwan is an enemy of God? Good Muslims don't sing. He's stark-raving mad. He repeats like a parrot without understanding. How do they kill all feelings in these boys and turn them into criminals? He has a brother who escaped from the sect. He tried to kill him too. I'd like to meet the brother. I'll get him. No. Iet's go to his house. They made my head spin with flattery. I believed them. "You're so smart. so unique. "Every word you speak is a pearl. Show us the way. "Let's go spend a few days in the desert. "If we meditate together, we'll be as one. "Nothing will ever tear us apart." Then they began to wear us down. Praying until dawn, marching through the desert. endlessly. in the burning sun. Not knowing where we were going, or why. Our feet burnt by the sand. "It purifies the soul and strengthens the will." In fact, it shattered our wills. We became slaves to the Emir's will. I was instructed to tell people that they had become impious, that they had to regain the path to Truth. Follow my advice and you'll see the way. Just like our Emir, who sees all, past, present and future. One day, he saw me steal from my mother and stick my finger in her eye. He shouted: "You shall deliver the world from the enemies of God!" He guides my weapon. Every throat I cut takes me one step closer to Paradise. Yesterday he had a vision: I was dressed in white, on my way to Paradise. Everything I'd ever longed for was laid out before me. That can only mean that I'm very close to being delivered. How about me? We chose you, didn't we? I shouldn't tell you this. The Emir had a vision of you ruling over Andalusia with all of us at your feet. We are your true family. Flee those who are in the clutches of the Devil. Open your heart and tell me all about yourself. All right? All right. What does your son do? Nothing at all! Everyone says he's a good-for-nothing! He should find a job! You find him one! You know lots of people. You're an important man. What can he do? He never liked studying. He likes giving orders. Make a soldier out of him! Someone told him: "Learn a few verses and you can order people around." Who wants to keep on being a good-for-nothing? Does murder make you good for something? - Answer me. - Stop harassing him! Has he lost his tongue? He's been silent for a month. When he does talk, he says: "I'll make you rich, you and all the neighbors!" Then he goes back to bed and he sleeps. And sleeps! Once thoroughly exhausted, you're ready to obey any orders. If they say "Kill your father," you do it. And if you get caught, they're the first to turn on you. What do you think, Sheik Riad? Can someone regain his dignity by stabbing a poet? The only right way is the way of the Lord. Had Marwan lost his way? Marwan is old enough to know right from wrong. "Evil is self-evident." Can these three children tell good from evil? It's up to the High Judge to decide. God says: "He who smites shall be smitten." If they are executed, they'll say they're martyrs on the way to Paradise. It's better that they enjoy their lives on earth! "For this world, act as if you were eternal, for the next, as if you must die tomorrow." He's a child! What does he know about death and eternity? Quiet! Listen to the judgement. Revelation is destined only to those endowed with Reason. That is, mankind. Divine law combines Revelation and Reason. It consists in determining causes and effects, means and ends. Revelation encompasses Reason and Reason encompasses Revelation. Certain children confuse religion and ignorance. Certain adults turn ignorance into a religion. Our young defendants were led into perdition. Without realizing it, they were forced astray. In its great equity, lslam refuses to condemn an unsound mind. The High Court abstains from capital punishment and sentences the accused to five years in prison. "God shall not be questioned, but they shall be questioned." He deserved to die. Is our house so terrible? There's plenty to eat and drink. We all help each other. But no. He wants everyone to obey him and call him "Emir". My son, the frog, wants to be a prince. What's the joy in giving orders? The judge won't change his mind, will he? I trust Averroes. From your mouth to God's ears! Long live Averroes! May God illuminate your way with His heavenly light! You're madmen talking about reason! What more do you want? The boys confessed. You flouted my authority by sparing him. The country is going to the dogs! Didn't I order him to be killed? Listen to me, brother. The boy is only eighteen. Fate saved Marwan by averting his knife. Marwan has forgiven him. Marwan? Since when is Marwan a judge? How can I protect you? They weren't responsible for their acts. Sheik Riad says otherwise. So does the Council of Theologians. I decide what's in the country's interest. Not Sheik Riad. Not you. Me. You refuse all advice? The Council agrees with me. They're very unhappy with your verdict. The Sheik is scheming. The same old hallucinations. Maybe. As long as I'm Judge, my conscience will guide me. Even if I lose face? Brother, your dignity is not in question. You've always been merciful. Think of the lives at stake. I won't go back on my word. This time, tragedy struck the sons of your citizens. Next time, it may strike your own sons. - I can protect them. - Lucky for them. But don't forget: Your citizens are your sons too. - Where is Saad? - The brother? I found him a job. If you can't hide him, I will. How beautiful! Our city must be. the envy of the whole world. Why did that idiot Emir of yours send Borhan to my house? One more blunder and I'll cut off his funding. Better yet. his head. - I have a request. - I paid you. Three "suicides". I've had to shut some mouths. I have a favor to ask. I can be of use to you. Speak. I want to become a judge again and regain my lost honor. Averroes branded me a common thief. You were stupid. He caught you accepting bribes. He's alert. I'm not after his position. I just want to be a judge again. Why are you aiming so low? You could take his place. You have a pretty face. Your beard is reason enough for me to give you his job. By resigning, you accuse my father. He's your best friend. You refuse him the benefit of the doubt you give to criminals. How can your father ignore what's going on? Those boys were bound hand and foot and hanged in nooses made of their clothes. It's their custom! When they're caught, they commit suicide! No, they were "suicided" so they can't talk! The sects are all over. Not in my courts! That would be the death of Andalusia. The Caliph is not above the law. He too is accountable for his acts. Decadence is gnawing away at kingdoms everywhere. Lies and corruption have replaced justice and morality. There's more at stake than a few dead boys. Our culture, whose source is lslam, is threatened. My father is protecting it! He built you a library! He had you analyze Aristotle! You wrote your commentaries thanks to him! And thanks to him, my mother had me! Say it! Here's my resignation. You're not through with me yet. I knew it. Averroes would never abandon us and leave Sheik Riad to do as he pleases. He expected a death sentence from you. It was in his interest. And you outfoxed him. - Three boys were killed! - Every cloud has a silver lining. What do you mean? Forget my father. Let's keep an eye on Sheik Riad. Get up. Get up and pray. There's the east. Get up! Die, but die pure. Marwan asked you here because he loves you. He's been waiting for you all week. Why didn't you come? My only duty is to avoid the Demon. Who is the Demon? Me? Marwan? Or his assailant? If you were pure, you'd know who attacked him. Thank God, there are serene people who see clearly. What do these geniuses say? The true culprit is in the palace. Your father? The Caliph doesn't need mercenaries. Are you crazy? Your father! "Darkness swallows up stray souls." Your father? "Abandon all Evil and you shall be saved." God keep you. Abdallah! Manuela, you're the only person I still love. Don't make me hate you. What's gotten into him? He's running away from me. Because I'm pregnant. With Abdallah's child? The Caliph's son? Woe betide us! Sarah's carrying Abdallah's child. That explains his behavior. When his father learns a gypsy will inherit the throne, he'll slit the baby's throat! If he came back, then he loves you. That's all that counts. He's crazy. She'd best forget him. I'll never be able to forget him! Neither will l. We're the ones to blame. We brought them together. It's not Sarah's fault. Or Abdallah's. I'll raise the child myself. No one will know a thing! Are you moving, Joseph? I'm looking for a safe hiding place. You never know. This is his life's work. The house of the High Judge isn't safe enough? You must have a special place where you keep your valuables. You mean my jewels? I've never had any! Averroes is poor? He spends everything on his books and students. Come here. Put them in the cellar. Put them behind the sacks of flour. Take this. Aristotle! Even without gallows. You're driving me crazy with your gallows! One more word about criminals and executioners and I'll send the lamb next door! - I'll let you starve! - Let's talk about happiness. Come sit next to me. Come here, my love. What is happiness? At daybreak, after I prepare your tea, I go back to bed and the rest of the world can go to hell. It's pure bliss. What else? When Salma was born, she didn't even cry. I thought I'd die! Then she started gurgling. I looked at her. She was so pretty. Gorgeous! Salma, here we are! I've brought Marwan! It's been ages! Marwan's back! I'm fine, thank God. It's good to see you all again! You're back on your feet. Manuela is grateful for all you've done. How is my queen doing? Nasser, you behaved like a true hero. Sing your song to your heart's content, for we can still sing. And we'll keep on singing day in, day out, for the rest of our lives. No, come back! Come on. What a catastrophe! - Take shelter! - All my books. destroyed! All your books are here. None are missing. They're all here. Your "Commentary on Aristotle". A little messy, but intact. My "Aristotle". I can't believe it. You're the best! How did you guess? Son of a witch! All this for a bean-pole who saves some books! I save his life and what do I get? Nothing! A book is worth a hundred lives. Maybe not for me. but for Averroes. - This is getting serious. - Maybe Joseph forgot a lamp. No, this is Sheik Riad's doing. Before, he just wanted to distract us. Now he'll use arson and murder to silence us. How evil! A pure man like you cannot imagine that others can stoop so low. You're pure too. Even I have a hard time believing it. Sheik Riad craves power for power's sake. If my suspicions are founded, he should hang ten times. He's the richest man in the land. What more could he want? Power. He'd do anything for it. He's driven by hunger. Does my father know? I sincerely hope so. Sheik Riad is loyal. Don't be ridiculous. He has always stood by my side. You gave him a lot of land in return. Does he want all Andalusia? I need him. People respect him. Let me rule my country. And get rid of Averroes? Sheik Riad, the man you accuse, opposes the fatwa that the Council demands. They want to burn all of Averroes' books. This one above all. "The lncoherence of lncoherence." I've read it. You understand their dismay. So that's why they set fire to his library. They all seem to agree with Ghazali. He's a great thinker and Averroes says he's wrong. What if Averroes is right? He's too sure of himself. He lacks modesty. He insists on calling me "brother". Where did he get that from? Are we related now? I had no idea. Your uncle is his latest dupe. My uncle loves him. That may be our downfall. Do you realize what a fatwa means? The annihilation of all of Averroes' works. As if he never existed. What are you making? A basket. So Sheik Riad's protecting me? From which fatwa? The one he recommended to the Council. - You knew about it? - Of course. And you didn't tell us? It's a sword hanging over our heads. - My father will intervene. - No, he won't. This is all so sad. The two of you were so close. Sheik Riad has spoiled that now. This is the logical consequence of my acts. I have to accept it. This fatwa threatens more than your books. Your life is danger. We all have to die someday. I'd rather die in bed, surrounded by weeping women. Lots of flowers and a stately funeral. But what's the difference if I die in a street? That's suicide! - What's wrong with him? - Nothing! He confronts hardships that would topple a mountain! Only I can understand him. Get back to your work. How many students has he had? He's educated at least one son in every family. He's taught a lot and given much. With one hundred students, we can recopy his work in two weeks. Two copies of each book. Nasser. are there rumors in the palace? - Let's make. - Three copies of each! Manuela, Sarah and I will work day and night. Manuela? This is supposed to be a secret! Manuela outrivals you and your ancestors! She's educated! She swears in 5 languages! I'll take a copy to France. - It's too dangerous! - It's to save my uncle's work. I was thinking that. Is Blue Eyes predicting the future again? Forget France! I'll take them to Marrakesh. Everyone's a relative there. Joseph wants to help and you give him a hard time! I'm starting now. I know his work by heart. I'll dictate. I'll do these with Manuela and Sarah. If you so much as blink, I'll hang you from the minaret. Understood? Uncle, Averroes must know nothing of our voyages. From me? My lips are sealed. Wisdom guides the virtuous theologian in his study of what we call "syllogism". And divine law guides the philosopher in his study of what we call "reason". Reason is the study of divine law. Philosophy is the study of wisdom. Everything that has been deduced from divine law is subject to interpretation. No devout Muslim can doubt this. Reason is the sister of divine law. The supposed conflict between them is a malicious invention. Taste this. Why are you wearing all that? Have you caught cold? Aunt Zeinab, I want you to know. you're like a mother to me. Not now. Taste this. Your blue eyes tell me you're leaving. You're going home? My heart tells me you'll soon be back. I'll put aside a jar of dates for you. I'll be back. I promise. It's safer if you travel by night. It's best if I mix with the crowds. If my father had done that, he'd still be alive. You're like a brother. But. I'm in love with someone else. With Nasser. My country is full of ignorance and misery, but I love it. I have to go pass on to them what I've learned here. Come what may? You really do love Averroes. I'm not the only one. This is a letter for him. That's his most important book. Have a safe trip. Tell your people that what we Arabs respect most is loyalty. And tell your people that what we Christians respect most is honesty. The best moments of my life were those I spent with you. But what can be better than saving books that will enlighten mankind? Your benevolence and kindness have overwhelmed me. After everything I've learned, I couldn't risk your forbidding me to go. This decision comes from deep within me. It is entirely mine. If you won't forgive me, at least be indulgent. You said: "Wherever we are, knowledge is a homeland and ignorance, a foreign place." I promise to return to the land of humanism and of love. Your son, Joseph. Manuela thinks that Abdallah has joined a sect. They've been stalking him. They nabbed him at the inn. He kept going to the desert and coming back covered with sand. He told me to mind my own business. Now he's gone again. Does Marwan know? Marwan was half-dead and Abdallah told him to pray. He told me: "The real culprit is in the palace." I said: "Your father? You're crazy!" And you kept quiet? I thought he was avoiding Sarah. What for? What a bunch of idiots! Marwan, I need to see you. Did you know about Joseph? Yes, I did. He can save your books if he wants. We all can. Stay seated. What would a member of a sect be learning in his third week of training? How to handle arms. Where would that happen? Wait for the water to settle! What are you doing? The more water, the more you see. If he knew you were improving his invention, Alhazen would roll over in his grave. I'm here to find Abdallah. That's all. It won't be easy to get in there. If you see him there, come tell me. Get some rest. We'll keep watch. Are you crazy? Here? Instead of sitting around. Iet's make a baby. If we were able to, Abdallah would worry us less. So then, let's just make love. Say yes and I'll get Abdallah back. It'll help me concentrate. You filthy brute! Worse than the gypsies! You're obsessed. Hands off or I'll scratch out your eyes. And I'll pull out your hair. Get it? Now you try. Wait until you hear someone shout "His Grace!" Then get a good look. He only shows his face once a year. Marwan, get up! Abdallah's there! I saw him! His Grace! An angel. There are a lot of them. Protect the Emir! Have them move back! Get back! I want him on my horse. Can't you hear? Get him on the horse! Abdallah! Tie his hands behind his back. Go join the others. You too. Stand up! We're respecting our agreement with Sheik Riad. We attack in two weeks. We expect Cordoba to be ready. No fighting. No resistance. Everything is in place. Sheik Riad will seem the perfect patriot. I trust him implicitly. Why would he risk losing what he's strived for all these years? The battle will allow us to eliminate Mansur. - And his heirs? - His sons? One babbles with the philosophers, the other eats out of our hands. And the philosophers? By the time they're understood, we'll be in power. - You're well-informed. - With all due modesty. Smuggling books. What decadence! Where were you? The whole palace is looking for you! "The infidels and blasphemers will burn in Hell." Then to hell with all of us! Why were you with those fanatics? You've made a mess of your life. - You have no right to question me. - But I am. Answer me! You want to kill Marwan? Why not kill me? Or our father? Kill him. "They'll suffer shame in this world and a mighty chastisement in the next." Out of my house, you lout! - Madwoman! - Go away! He's the crown prince! Does that allow him to hit his brother? This is my house! I pay the tithe. So get out! Who is he? Just the crown prince. Welcome to our humble home. He's not welcome at all! Why not? He's a brute who hits his brother! Your brother hits you all the time. He's a brute too! - Even your father. Look. - Mother, not now. Stay put or you're dead! He'll stay here until he's back in shape. You may be a son to me, but none of your tricks. Be a good boy. I'll make you some saffron rice. We'll celebrate. He'll sing and dance like before. Averroes was right. Things are never as simple as they seem. Your assailants were like him. He's a criminal too. He should be punished. He's your brother. Where was he hiding all this hate? Those lunatics unleashed it! They're experts at instilling hate. Go ask Averroes. He knows their methods now. And he says to fight hate with hate? The Christians are pushing us into the sea. You're busy playing with the gypsies while I'm here all by myself building the greatest fleet in history. - This time, it's serious. - No more than any other time! Your lack of foresight makes you an unworthy prince and an unworthy human being. And you consider yourself a worthy father? I'll forgive you. They're not your words. Averroes has managed to turn you against me. They kidnapped Abdallah and shattered his will. You told me he joined them willingly. They'll make a man of him. - They'll make a criminal of him. - Keep him under guard. What else can I do for you? Take us seriously. I don't eat the food of sinners. You've become too skinny. - Your heart. - My heart is my business. Stomp on it, if you want. But be careful. I'm in it. God alone is in my heart. But God is love. Our Emir eats only a date a day. But you said he was an angel. You and I are mortals. Or have you become an angel? Eat. You're skin and bones. "To withstand God's ordeals is a virtue." Your brother is right. They've hardened your heart. Bon appetit! Sing your song to your heart's content for we can still sing. And we'll keep on singing day in, day out, for the rest of our lives. And if ever one day they try to break you, stand up tall Iike the proud palm tree reaching up to the sky. Don't let them beat you. Don't let them break you. Don't let them scare you. Be like a dream, blossoming in the desert. Sing your song to your heart's content, for we can still sing. Only dancing can bring him back to us. Your song, resounding amongst mankind, will make the night's heart beat with joy and heal the wounds of the innocent. Will you dance? I will too. Despite myself, I'll dance too. Despite myself. despite myself. I'll dance too. Until your dream is entwined with mine. despite myself, I'll dance too. Soon enough, you'll be dancing in hell! Maybe. But look at you. You've made your hell on earth! Get off your horse. Kneel down and beg for mercy. Perfect. Marwan! All infidels will meet the same fate. We shall purge society of the vile Mansur. The country will now live according to the precepts of God, his Prophet, and his successor. You're faced with the choice of a lifetime. If you want to, take my horse, follow them. I wish it had been you who delivered the mortal blow. To die by your hand. what bliss. He's dead! Murderer! I'm to blame for Marwan's death. How presumptuous! He alone decided to die. For him, saving you was a duty. - I'd never have thought. - Thought? You let others do the thinking for you. If you want a shoulder to cry on, a word of warning: I'm neither Marwan, nor your father. - Marwan wasn't my father. - He chose to be. That's far more noble than giving life. He taught you to love life. And he paid the price. My real father never cared about me. Every man has his limits. Your father can't give what he hasn't got. You're no longer a child. You're responsible for your choices. You're too old to whine: "Mother hit me, Father neglected me "and he preferred my brother. "I hate the whole world so I'll accuse it of being impious." That's too easy. Too easy to justify the laziness, hatred and jealousy you carry within yourself by blaming it on others. Do you aspire to greatness? You'll reach it by doing something for others. What's impious is reveling in your hatred. That's heresy! - I want to spread God's word. - Whose do I spread? The Devil's? You? Spreading God's word? How presumptuous. You're so hollow, you repeat whatever nonsense you're told. Learn a poem and a Koranic verse and you're a poet and scholar? What do you know about medicine and astronomy, about mathematics and chemistry. about philosophy? Do you know enough about love. about truth. about justice. to claim to be able to spread God's word? Answer me! Why do I keep on writing? My ideas don't reach anyone anymore! Why should I wait for them to burn my books? I'll burn them myself! It's every man for himself! Let them burn! Keep out of it! I'm not an animal! Animals have more heart than you and your sect! Do you understand? Zeinab! I was worse with him than they were. God forgive me. You kicked me out of your house. And I'll do it again. Do you want me to leave? Nasser was Marwan's best friend. He's come to console you. You were all so handsome. Three suns which merged into one. Nasser. Joseph. and Marwan. I've come to thank you for the joy you gave him. Thanks to you, not only Marwan, but all of us Iearned about the joy of life. Still here? You're not with your "friends"? Marwan had to die? - Nasser! - How can you allow him here? Marwan always looked after Abdallah like a son. Can't we forget? Can't we forgive? Console him. He's lost his father. Marwan. Sing your song to your heart's content, for we can still sing. Nasser! Don't let yourself be blinded by hate. Saving this one book was worth all the risks. Read me something from it. I'm going back. You're resigning, like a lowly employee? Go, if you want to. No one is indispensable to me. I'll find ten others like you. It's my father who appointed you. I inherited you from him. In that case, I may go. You may not! You're a commoner now. You're subject to my whims. Dismissed! All this fuss over the death of a cockroach. They claim responsibility for Marwan's death and menace their enemies with the same. They undermine justice and your authority. Riad rules the streets. Are you sure it's Sheik Riad who rules the streets? Or is it you? Why not? I'm not interested in power. But you're interested in glory. In immortality. Living on for posterity. Don't worry. Sheik Riad knows his limits. Let's hope so. Show me a man who is not a slave to his pride. His place is in my heart. You hate me. I hate ignorance and vanity. - You think I'm vain? - I think Sheik Riad is. No need to fear. I'm more clever than he is. Sit down. Such is politics. Politics without morality is doomed to failure. Don't you see? The political situation decides for us. Our conscience should decide. If I didn't owe you some respect, I'd destroy you. Destroy me rather than both yourself and the country. I won't write anymore. Then they've won. They've broken you and severed you from Mansur. Had I stayed with him, I'd have ended up hating him or myself. If you could hate him, you wouldn't be grieving. A friend who is spurned seeks revenge. He despises himself for the love he once gave. It's just me and you. I esteem neither your politics nor your company. I'm not thrilled about yours either. Go console your friend in his fall. - Providence is on his side. - And not on mine? I thought no one was indispensable to you. Can we really expect. Can we expect a man to be a great strategist, a great leader and a good, loving father? We ask nothing of your father. He is what he is. We must make our own way. My way is. to Egypt. Tomorrow at dawn. Now that's a decision! You better stick to it. - You agree? - I agree if the decision is yours, if you put your father behind you, if you forgive Abdallah and if you say you love me as I love you. You're in love with Joseph. The day he left, you stared into his eyes from the roof. My mother likes his blue eyes too. I saw you kiss him! He's the one who kissed me. When you leave, I'll go to the roof and stare at you. Will you? Swear to God that you'll marry me. - Another decision! - I'll tell your father. - He knows I love you. - You told him? - My mother did. - She knows? Everyone knows but you. Go. When you come back, my trousseau will be ready. I'll go faster than my shadow. Father will refuse your trip and our marriage. - I demand both. - Or nothing at all. We'll stand up to him. The two of us. together. What are you waiting for? Someone's permission? Joseph would have. Let them burn my books! Someone else can write them! Great thinkers don't grow on trees! Too bad. Such is my destiny and that of the nation. I'm scared, but I'm letting him go. You write books to incite people, to rouse them, to make them think! We have a right to take a stand and share the risks! She sounds just like her father! Thank God she looks like her mother! Quiet! My husband is gorgeous! I have to take responsibility for my decisions. Exactly. Besides, I'm the Caliph's son. I'll make myself respected. No one will be able to stop me. He's already proved his worth. Salma and I are for. He and I are against. Are we? How about me? Salma and Nasser are for. You and Abu Yehia are against. I've always played fair. I'm with them. That makes three against two. Isn't that right? You're always right, my love. Go. No one can deprive the world of wisdom. God keep you. I'll do our children proud. As soon as we have some. Where are they? Here and there. They're approaching Guadalquivir. They're a stone's throw away. Where did we go wrong? After Alarcos, we wasted our fighting forces in futile battles. Our army has suffered. Nothing I do is futile. Sire. The enemy is here and we jabber away. How about the enemies within? They're undermining your power. Your friend Averroes warned you. If you mention his name again, I'll throw you in jail! Go ahead. You're the Caliph. People bow, even when you fart! It's Averroes who divided the nation! He just happens to resign when the enemy attacks. He just happens to send my son God knows where. And the enemy happens to read his books! Do they contain military secrets? Ideas belong to all of mankind. Our kingdom was born of an idea. Ideas will live on Iong after you and I fall into oblivion. I'll win this battle. It's his ideas that will perish. Ideas have wings. No one can stop their flight. I can! I'll have all his books burnt! I'll banish him! It'll be the end of Almohad culture and all of Andalusia. I am Andalusia! Not him! Open the doors! Show Sheik Riad in. Can you rally the people? Of course. How long will it take? A day. a moment. They're waiting for you. Ever since our glorious Saladin - God bless his soul - set Jerusalem free, unifying Arab people the world over, Christians have sought revenge. Their one wish is to destroy our empire which has enlightened the world for over six centuries. They want Andalusia to sink back into misery and ignorance. They'll burn our homes, kill our children. They want our blood. Can we let the enemy take back the land which our forefathers turned into a paragon of civilization? Can we? God has given us a leader even more glorious than Saladin! Our mentor is pure. He is courageous and inspired. Mansur the Victorious! Commander of the believers of Andalusia! We are your soldiers, Victorious One! Glorious believers. The world will soon know that Paradise is for the pure of heart. What happened, Sheik Riad? You left during my speech. It is you who inspires the people. You and you alone. Whatever you say arouses their enthusiasm. They hung upon your every word. There's no use talking about land and honor. Just tell them it's God's will. Every one of them will obey. You're a real saint. And a clever one at that. For foundering in the ocean of illusion and obscuring the people's judgement, the Caliph forbids the following people from teaching in schools and mosques. Furthermore, the Caliph orders that their books be burnt in public and that they be banished. It's Averroes! Are you hurt? Al-Razi, only you can be entrusted with this. I don't always agree with what Averroes says, but under such circumstances it is my duty to save these books. My father has great respect for Averroes, but. He ordered these books burnt and their author banished. It will soon take effect. I learned of this yesterday. Sheik Riad has won. Run back to Averroes. If he sees his books burn without knowing they've been saved, he'd die. "Commentary on Aristotle by Averroes of Andalusia" "The lncoherence of lncoherence" Subjective, conflicting interpretations of divine law which assert their veracity above all others have torn the country apart. We are all to be held responsible for these rifts, for these schisms. Tell her she's wrong! No, your mother is right. Everything stays but the bench. Take the cupboard while you're at it! Remember? Life is so cruel with us. Leaving everything. We've been through worse. As long as we're together. we'll pull through. Tell me. Do you remember this bench? Of course I do. I thought you'd forgotten. Our first night. On the bench. God forgive you! Thank God, you're safe. Nasser's back. I want him docile or I want him dead. Meeting like this is a true blessing. Indeed. I'm going to betray one of Sheik Riad's secrets. The Spaniards want peace. Who wouldn't? "If they incline to peace, incline to it." They want us to reduce the army and give out some gifts to pacify the people and make them amenable. Trade will thrive. We all stand to profit from it. What does the Caliph of Andalusia think? My father is the Caliph of Andalusia. Al-Mansur. He's given enough. He deserves a long rest. I've been trained to kill you. From behind? Go ahead. Won't your hand obey? Do it. I could have if they'd reached my heart. But they only played with my mind. Who's "they"? Those you wish to please by burning his books. Justice is done! Too late. I know your books are safe in Egypt. Of course. Abdallah almost killed me. Sheik Riad has sided with the Spaniards. I was offered your throne. They lost. I'm ready to fight now. So am l. Heaven has answered your prayers, Sheik Riad. Enter. Not thwarting Averroes' plans would have been disastrous. He can do us no more harm. Now that we are unified, we can confront the enemy together. You and your sects will go to the front line. As a shield. An example for those willing to die in the name of lslam. Victory or death. both lead to Paradise. - I'm not a warrior. - Come now! Your eloquence alone gets the masses marching! Have you nothing to say, Sheik Riad? Who'll run the country? No one. It will run itself. - The philosophers can do no more harm. - I'm an old man. Don't underestimate yourself! You're in fine health! I know my dream will come true. I saw you leading the army, charging with the troops, dressed in white, a sword in hand. - I've never held a weapon. - Now's your chance! The mettle of a warrior is apparent only in battle. - Sword against sword. - Take mine. We know that the enemy is gathering near Jaen. Get your men ready. We attack at daybreak. We're attacking them at Jaen? That's what our new "general" will tell them. - We'll attack at Alarcos. - Perfect. Sire. Averroes' books are safe. I took a copy of each to Egypt. Thank God. That was a wise thing to do. Thank you. May I tell him? We set off in an hour. I won't be long. Will you restore him his honors? I accused him of treason. Shall I contradict myself now? What made you fall into your own trap? Vanity. The books! They're safe! Sarah, Manuela, his books are safe in Egypt! That's Aunt Zeinab! Move away! We have to congratulate him! - I'll marry you when I come back. - No, now! Wait. I'll be back. Just a moment. Thank you. Thank you. A thousand thanks. Ideas have wings. No one can stop their flight. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack One Sunday in 1828 a ragged boy was found abandoned in the town of N. He could hardly walk and spoke but one sentence. Later, he told of being locked in a dark cellar from birth. He had never seen another human being, a tree, a house before. To this day no one knows where he came from - or who set him free. Don't you hear that horrible screaming all round you? That screaming men call silence? THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER Writing. Wri - ting! Remember that: writing. If you write nice now, papa'll give you nice horsey. Horsey. Horsey! - Horse. - Horse. Horsey! Repeat after me: I want to be a gallant rider like my father was before me. Say it! I want to be a gallant rider like my father was before me! Gallant rider. Gallant rider like my father. - Father. - Father. - . was before me. - . was before me. Remember that! Remember that! Come on now. Stand here. Hold this letter. The letter. Stay right here. Wait here. Wait for me here! What do you want here? Horsey! I'm asking you what you want here? Like my father was before me! Ah, maybe it's that you don't know your way around here? Can I be of service? Is it that letter there you're wanting to bring? Let's have a look at it. "To the Cavalry Captain of the Fourth Squadron Sixth Schwolische Regiment. " Let's see now, that'll be straight ahead past Augustinergasse, round the corner, that's the Captain's house. Should I take you there? Or have you got other plans? Say, where are from now? Ansbach, Erlangen, Regensburg? Regensburg! Regensburg, good - come along now! The young man here's from Regensburg here's a letter for the Captain. The Captain is not here. He'll be in this evening. Ah, but the young man is very weary. Can't we find a place for him till then? Not in the house, perhaps in the barn. Horsey! Right, with the horses on the straw. There he can give the letter to the Captain. Horsey. - Is that him? - Yes. We've tried everything we could to wake him, without success. Have you ever seen him before? No, never. Here's the letter. He didn't want to let go of it. From the Bavarian border, no place name, dated 1828. "His Excellency the Captain. " "Does it say "His Excellency"? It does, yes! "I'm senden yr Grace a bouye. " Senden yr Grace, hah hah! Should I take that down? Yes, please do. "This here bouye wants to serve his King faithfully. " "The bouye was laid me on. " He says the boy was "laid" him on 7th October, 1812. "I am a poor laborer with 10 children and have enough to do to feed myself and my wife. His mother wanted to raise the boy, but I couldn't ask her to. I didn't tell her the boy was laid on me by the Court. I have not let him take one step out of the house since 1812 so nobody doesn't know a thing about him. You can ask him, but he can't tell you. I teached him reading and riting. and he says he wants to be. ". a gallant rider like his father. " A gallant rider, yes. ". a gallant rider like his father was before him. If he had parents he would have been a smart fellow. " A smart fellow, yes. "You only have to show him something and he can do it. But please do not plie him with questions. " Ply with 'ie'. "He don't know where I am I brought him away by night. I am not signing my name. " No, there's no signature. - Did you get it all down? - Yes. This is very odd. Yes, indeed! Should I report no signature? Yes, and put this in the file. I'll try him again. No, don't. Leave him be. You can see it's no use. He seems to be not quite all right in the head. He's coming around. Your name! Should I report that he refuses to talk? Yes, name unknown. Where are you from? And his passport? Gallant rider. Occupation? Where were you born? He says he comes from Regensburg. From Regensburg. The intelligence of this man is in a state of absolute confusion. There's nothing to be gained by police interrogation. Should I take that down? Nothing to be gained by police interrogation, yes. Refuses to answer. He refuses to answer! Right, and what do we do now? Maybe he's hungry? It's worth a try. Lay him down again! Spits out food! Spat out food. Let's have a look at his feet. I say, those are old boots. Those boots have very old toes! Bleeding of the toes, scabs. Indicates a long period of. Feet extremely tender. Both feet show same indications of extreme tenderness. Aha, vaccination marks! The foundling seems to be of the higher orders! Foundling, yes, get that down. Upper arm injured. What was this injury caused by? By a blunt instrument, I'd say. Blunt instrument, I'd say. The same marks here, and here. Put that down! A prayer book! Entitled "Spiritual Forget-me-nots". Beautiful and Devoted Morning Prayers for Faithful Souls. The other book a printed treatise entitled 'Six Deep and Devotional Prayers'. Put under 'other things'. A four-cornered, folded square of paper, containing yes, a small quantity of gold dust, or gold leaf. Put that with the other things. Then a rosary. rosary. A rosary with a metal cross. With the other things. Under the circumstances, this man should be taken into custody! Put that down, word for word. A pencil! And a sheet of paper. Can he write? Can you write? Kaspar Hauser. The fellow is not as wild as I thought: he came peacefully. He seems harmless enough. I've done all I can. The rest is up to the authorities. Maybe we should place him under oath. He did not impress us as being either mad or depraved. Neither mad nor depraved. It's best we keep him in this tower for criminals and vagabonds. He doesn't look like going berserk. No, but you never can tell. He'll have to sit up to eat, he can't eat on the floor. Julius, take his feet. You hold him back. now forward. Now he's on his feet! Sit him down there. Let's stretch his feet out. I guess he never sat up straight at a table before! He never sat up at all in the tower. Take the bowl away. Hold on to the table there! Come on, let go! Give me your hat, you won't be needing it now. Leave him be, it's all right. Let's start. You've got to eat, come on. You can't eat with your hat! He won't give it to me. There, take the spoon and start eating. Look. look. like this. Do it like me. He'll be all right, it's just that he don't have no manners yet. So, open your mouth. See, I told you so! Oh, my goodness me! Take his bowl away, he's not used to it. Give him bread, he always takes bread when you give it to him. Bread. take the bread. Give him a drop of water, Julius. Look, it's empty, there's nothing more inside. Nothing comes out any more. - Empty! - Empty. Empty! Nothing more inside. All gone. Empty. Empty. No, this jug's not empty, there's beer in it. Look. it's full, it's not empty. That cup there is empty. There's nothing in it. Empty. It'll take time, getting him used to such things. Don't cry, don't cry. Oh my, how my gut is painin' me! Finger, thumb, arm. This is your hand, this is your arm. Arm. nose. mouth. Look, this is your ear. Look, I've even got a mirror! This here is your ear. My gut is killing me. Finger. shoulder arm. No, that's your hand. This is your arm. Hand, hand! This is your arm. Arm, arm, arm. Hand. Hey, what kind of place is this here, anyway? Damn your eyes, ain't there nothin' in this place to drink? Stand up, Kaspar, stand up! You don't have to be ashamed, we're alone here. Only the dear Lord is watching, don't be afraid. Mother, my skin is coming off! Don't worry about it. He hasn't had a bath in years. Lap, lap, lap, I like this milk, Lap, lap, lap as smooth as silk. Good morning, little cat so white. May I sit down by your side? Good morning, little cat so white, May I sit down by your side? Be nice to me little girl so fair, Then you may sit down right there. Lap, lap, lap I like this milk, Lap, lap, lap as smooth as silk. Agnes, that rhyme is too long for him. All he knows are separate words. I just taught him separate words and he can't understand your rhyme yet. It's no use, he doesn't even respond to a feigned thrust. Doesn't respond to feigned thrust. I don't think he's a hard boiled swindler. He's got absolutely no conception of danger! No conception of danger. It didn't even scare him. How about trial by fire? - Is that for the record? - Yes. He's not afraid of the flame. Charmed to meet you! Charmed, I'm sure! Look at him gapin'! He's never seen that before. Look, look. look here! Pick up the baby, Kaspar, go ahead. Mother, I am so far away from everything. I eat with my handses. With your hands! With my handses. With your hands! Have you heard anything? A number of people have testified that the foundling ran away from a group of English circus equestrians. - They were in the Oberpfalz area. - What was that? Other citizens say he is a member of the Baden dynasty who was to be eliminated as most likely heir. The Baden dynasty, however is beyond all reproach. Besides, there are better ways of getting rid of unwanted heirs. I don't believe the story in any case. Just look at him with his coarse, rustic features! There's nothing refined about him at all. She can't walk on two feet! After all, he's beginning to be a burden on the community coffers. He's costing us a pretty penny. Perhaps he should begin contributing to his own upkeep somehow. One could turn the public interest in him to good use. Come right on up, ladies and gentlemen! Parents keep an eye on their children! Now before we present the Four Riddles of the Spheres we have for you an entertaining intermezzo. This wild bear, Kublai Khan, from farthest central Asia came to us somewhere in Mongolia, where the Huns live. With one sweep of his mighty paw he can kill a bull! But here in the temperate zones, dear children he is as tame and cuddly as a little cat. Here our Indian fire-eater, our fakir a living flame, a veritable mountain of fire! He has succeeded, ladies and gentlemen, by will power alone in rejecting every trace of a burn or scorch! Show us your skin, soft as a baby's, not a blemish. What's this, you scoundrel? And now ladies and gentlemen for the very first time in the history of the world. Brought together for you and only for the first time: The Four Riddles of the Spheres! Minors please keep their distance. The gravity of my presentation permits of no childish pranks. And now for the first Riddle: The Little King! Monarch of the Golden Land of Punt of song and legend. The last link of an ancient line of giants! Each king of this line was tinier than the last. Here you see that the last living member of the royal family. Another few centuries, and the Kings of Punt will be invisible. The very last king will be no bigger than a flea! Yes, there he sits, our Little King cowering like an outcast in the corner of his throne. And as the kings have grown tinier, so have their kingdoms. His kingdom is no larger than the spot he is sitting on for neither can he leave his kingdom without outside help nor can he climb it. Our next Riddle, ladies and gentlemen. Our next Riddle of Science - the Young Mozart! One day long ago he fell into a deep trance and asked for nothing more but the music of Mozart. At a tender age he already knew all the scores by heart. Now, still in the trance, he looks for dark holes in the earth because they tried to teach him to read and write at school. Since that day he has lost the power of speech. He was not able to read or write he says because the whiteness of the paper blinded him. Day in, day out, he peers into dark, deep holes in the earth looking for entrances to caves and underground waterways. As you see, there is no way to gain the poor fellow's attention. His mind is completely engrossed in zones of twilight. Our next Riddle, a living specimen of anthropology is Hombrecito. An untamed Indian from the sunny shores of New Spain. This wildman is the sole remaining member in all of Europe of the renowned and legendary Kaffir and Indian Show. He plays his wooden flute night and day, because he believes that if he stops, all the people in town will die. He wears three separate jackets to keep from catching cold and to protect himself from the evil breath of mankind. Hombrecito is a jolly good fellow, and quite tame. He speaks hardly a word of any tongue - except Indian of course. And now to the final and greatest Riddle of all! Kaspar, the Foundling! He has agreed, with the express permission of the authorities to appear in person here every afternoon, and thus.. .to ease the community's financial burden. Thank you, Kaspar! Kaspar Hauser was found in the Town Square of this fine city just as you see him standing before you today. In his right hand, a prayer-book and his left, the Anonymous Letter. Abandoned to his fate in a strange town the boy could neither speak nor walk. He had never seen a living being in his life before! His origin remains in darkness to this day, ladies and gentlemen. Is he a prince? Or possibly the legitimate son of Napoleon? His is and will remain the Riddle of the European Continent! Stop, Hombrecito! Kaspar, come back! Are you mad? I will get you! Stop in the name of the Law! There he is! Come down from there! Stop shaking that branch! If that branch breaks, I'll.! Come down here! Keep searching for Kasper. The beehive! Ah, it's locked. He couldn't be in there. I want to fly like a rider midst the bloody tussle of war! What a fine, what a beautiful report this will make! I shall write a report the likes of which has never been seen! Kaspar, what's wrong? Are you feeling well? It feels strong in my heart. The music feels strong in my heart. I feel so unexpectedly old. You've been such a short time in the world, Kaspar. Why is everything so hard for me? Why can't I play the piano like I can breathe? In the two short years you have been here with me you have learned so much! The people here want to help you make up for lost time. The people are like wolves to me! No, you mustn't say that. Look at Florian, he lives here too. He lost his family in a fire, he is blind, but does he complain? No, he plays the piano the whole day long even though his music sounds a little strange. Oh, how it is! A very big man must have built it. I would like to meet him. A man doesn't have to be as tall as the tower he builds. He can use a scaffold! I'll take you to see a new building. You lived in this tower, where that little window is. That cannot be! Because the room is only a few steps big. I don't understand. Wherever I look in the room to the right, to the left frontwards and backwards - there's only room. But when I look on the tower. At the tower! .and I turn around, the tower is gone! So, the room is bigger than the tower! No, Kaspar, that's not right. Think about it a little more. I still don't understand. How do you mean that? Yes, let's ask him. It's important. Another cup of coffee, Pastor. Yes, please, it's excellent! Another cup of coffee? Yes, please. You're not going to torture him much longer, are you? I wouldn't call it torture! - I'll leave the pot here. - Thanks. Kaspar, what we really want to know is.. .whether a Higher Being didn't occupy your thoughts in prison. I don't understand the question. In my prison I didn't think of anything and I cannot imagine that God created everything out of nothing like you say! If he doesn't understand God, then he'll simply have to have faith! You must have faith! The tenets of faith transcend mortal doubt. First I have to learn to read and write better to understand. No, Kaspar, the articles of faith are more important. And do stop pressing your thumb and finger when you speak! And now, my son, please repeat this prayer after me. Repeat after me! For the peace of God is higher than all mortal coils. Keep our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Please, repeat. Say it! Look, these are last years apples. Big and red, aren't they? And those apples on the tree will look just the same soon. How do they do that? Time does it, Kaspar. And the Lord's plan! Let the apples lie, they're tired and want to sleep. Kaspar, an apple can't be tired. Apples don't have lives of their own - they follow our will. I'm going to roll one down the path, it'll stop where I want it to. The apple didn't stop, it hid in the grass! May I have your help in demonstrating it to him Mr. Fuhrmann? Come here, Kaspar, watch! Stand here where you can see. Now, Mr. Fuhrmann is going to put out his foot and when I roll the apple, it will stop right where we want it to. Smart apple! It jumped over his foot and ran away! Smart apple! What are women good for? Can you tell me that, Katy? Women are not good for anything but sitting still! But Kaspar. Why are women allowed only to knit and cook? You'll have to ask Mr. Daumer that, Kaspar. He'll know a decent answer for you. I already asked Mr. Daumer. Yes, Mr. Daumer is an educated man. I will never learn as much as him. He told me about the Sahara Desert and I can't get it out of my head! Katy, have you been to the Sahara Desert? I'm just a housekeeper, I don't go journeying so much. I was in Erlangen once, but it's a long way from there to the desert! I know a story about the desert, but only the beginning. Yes, Mr. Daumer told me about it. He said you couldn't get past the beginning of your story and that you should wait to tell it until you know the end and not just the beginning. Yes, he takes it seriously, that you should learn to tell a story right. If I. can ask Mister Daumer to read this letter at his pleasure. A few days ago I took some cress seeds and sowed my name with them. And it came up right pretty. And it made me so happy that I can hardly say. And yesterday, when I came back from boating. .. somebody had come into the garden.. .and stepped on my name. I cried for a long time. I am going to sow the name again. It dreamed to me. You had a dream? Tell it to me! Yes, it dreamed to me. You're really coming along, Kaspar. You used to think all your dreams were real. Just a fortnight ago, you said you saw the mayor's wife even though everybody knows she'd gone on a journey. Strange that you didn't dream once during your years in prison! I dreamed of the Caucasus. It just can't be true when you say that your bed is the only place in the world you're really happy in. Don't you like the garden? The gooseberry bushes? Or the onions over there? All so green? Well, it seems to me that my coming into this world was a terribly hard fall! But Kaspar! That. No, that's not. How should I explain it to you? The Professor here has come all this way to ask you a question. He wants to see how well you can think and what you have learned in these two years and whether you can think logically. Will you answer him? - Yes! - Good. Kaspar let's pretend that this is a village. In this village live people who tell only the truth. Here is another village. The people here only tell lies. Two paths run from these villages to where you are standing and you are at the crossroads. A man comes along, and you want to know which village he comes from the village of the truthtellers or the village of the liars. Now in order to solve this problem, to solve it logically you have one question, and only one. What is the question? That's too difficult for him, how can he know that. I admit, the question is thorny. If you ask the man whether he comes from the village of truth and he does, then he will say, truthfully, yes. But if he comes from the village of lies, he will lie and also answer yes! Yet there exists one question which will solve the problem. That's much to hard, too complicated. You have one question, Kaspar and only one, to solve this problem of logic. I wouldn't know either. If you can't think of the question then I shall tell you. If you came from the other village would you answer 'no' if I were to ask you whether you came from the liars' village? By means of a double negative the liar is forced to tell the truth. This construction forces him to reveal his identity, you see. That's what I call logic via argument to the truth! Well, I know another question. You do? There is no other question, by the laws of logic. There isn't? But I do know another question. Let us hear it, then! I should ask the man whether he was a tree-frog. The man from the truth village would say: No, I'm not a tree-frog, because he tells the truth. The man from the liars' village would say: Yes, I'm a tree-frog, because he would tell a lie. So I know where he comes from. No, that's not a proper question. That won't do, I can't accept it as a question. That's no logic; logic is deduction, not description. What you've done is describe something, not deduce it. But I understood his question. Understanding is secondary; the reasoning is the thing. In Logic and Mathematics we do not understand things we reason and deduce: I cannot accept that question.

With gratitude we record the Guardianship Council's petition to all men of generous heart to ease the lot of the poor and destitute among us. Flowers will also be accepted. No, Katy dear, my eyes aren't what they used to be. Would you be so kind as to call on the tailor today? Kaspar will be needing his new coat tomorrow.
