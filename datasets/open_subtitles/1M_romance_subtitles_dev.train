We're joining the ball club in Florida. Goodbye, baby doll. - See you next season - 'Bye. Lucky punch, that's what it was. How many times have I told you to pick on somebody your size? There ain't nobody my size! I could have knocked the big lug for a loop. - But I didn't want to hurt my hands. - Sure. You don't want me to show up at training with a busted hand, do you? You save these pictures, don't you? For the kids at the park, yeah. That's me. I'd sooner have my picture in front of a theatre. You and your show business.

Give me vaudeville anytime. And maybe a musical show. 50 girls. Maybe even 100 girls. Oh, boy! I suppose it would be more fun than playing checkers. You suppose? You know, Denny you're getting old enough to find out. To tell you the truth, Ed lately, I have been thinking a lot about romance and about girls. No! Yeah. - They smiled at us. Let's go talk to them. - We don't even know them. But I feel like talking. I'm a very sociable fellow. Let's go talk to those fellows over there. It ain't the same.

We had time for play. The art shows, the birdwalks, the museums were nice. Tell them about the girls! The quail! The mice! The mice! Yeah, the girls. "I kissed a gal in old Wyoming "She rode a horse in a Wild West show "When I said, 'Baby, I'm bent on roaming' "She cried, 'We just got started' and she sighed, 'We can't be parted' "But I left her broken-hearted at the rodeo "Oh, yes, indeed "Yes, indeedy "Yes, indeed "The boy said, 'No' "Yes, indeed "Yes, indeedy "I left her broken-hearted at the rodeo "I kissed a gal way out in Boise "That's Idaho where potatoes grow "I went away and her sobs were noisy "I said, 'I'll see you later' and I hopped the nearest freighter "Left her holding a potato down in Idaho "Yes, indeed "Yes, indeedy "Yes, indeed The boy said, 'No' "Yes, indeed "Yes, indeedy "She's left with her potatoes down in Idaho "I kissed a gal in old Poughkeepsie "That's where the College of Vassar's found "She couldn't study, love made her tipsy "Her teachers wouldn't pass her so she just turned on the gas "And now the sweetest gal at Vassar's in the cold, cold ground "Yes, indeed "Yes, indeedy "Yes, indeed The boy's a hound "The sweetest gal at Vassar's in the cold, cold ground "I met a gal when we hit Manhattan "A scrumptious babe dressed in silk and lace "Her eyes were stars and her skin were satin "I told her how I'd missed her then she murmured that and this "So I thought I'd try to kiss her, but she slapped my face!

Liars? What the hay? "We're the biggest pair of liars in the USA" Gilhuly! - How are you? - Hiya, Mike. How are you? What's ailing him? I've got some bad news for you. This just came. "From the law office of Hergesheimer, Hergesheimer, Hergesheimer, Herge." Never mind the batting order. "Gentlemen. ".this will inform you that according to the will of Colonel J. B. Newhouse. ".former owner of the baseball club known as the Wolves. ".all rights and interests in said club. ".have been bequeathed to the late Colonel's young and distant relative. ".one K. C. Higgins. ".who will arrive in Florida on the 10th instant to assert ownership. ".and actively participate in the management of said club." - Who's K. C. Higgins? - He'll probably want to pitch. We got to take orders from a dopey kid who never swung a bat? - Looks that way. - Not to me! I don't know about you, but I want us to win the pennant. You don't cop any prize money finishing in last place. This happened to Baltimore once. They had to dig them out of the cellar. - Lf this guy opens his trap, I quit! - So do I! Wait a minute. Quiet. Wait a minute now. How about a little fair play here, boys? You guys don't even know this Higgins. Now here's what I say. He's gonna arrive here Sunday morning. Until then, let's keep an open mind. Above all, let's not judge him too hastily. The little rat! You take the back end. Are you Mr. Higgins? K. C. Higgins? - Higgins? - No. Good. - Are either of you Higgins? - No. - I'm so sorry. - That's all right. I never did have any sense of direction, Miss. - K. C., Miss Higgins. - Thank you. You're welcome. Florida Palms Hotel, please. K. C. Higgins! He's a girl! Miss? Are you looking for someone? Yes, I am. Michael Gilhuly, he's the manager of the Wolves. Could you point him out to me? Lt'd be an awful long point. He's down at the railroad station. He went to meet the 12:10. That's the train I came in on. I must have missed him. I wonder how he missed you. Mike ought to be along very soon. Where are your manners? Give the lady your seat. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - Won't you sit down? One of our very nicest chairs. Go read your funny papers, kid. Mike's in a nasty temper this morning. Boy, is he mad! What seems to be the trouble? He's gone to get the new owner of the club. Is that bad? Bad? On the trip down, you didn't run into a little fathead named Higgins, did you? A little fathead? Some, lamebrain from Providence, Rhode Island. Excuse me, but I'd better. You better wait until Mike cools off. Now, look, baby doll. Just put yourself in my hands. Fast worker, that boy. Just met her, and he's rounding third. It's a sad situation, miss. Picture this. Here we are, the greatest team in baseball, the champs and this little fathead from Providence will come here and teach us the game. - How do you like that? - It's very depressing. Don't ever be a ball player. I'll try and avoid it. Let's talk about you. What are you doing tonight after dinner? I hadn't made any. - After dinner? - Yeah, how about stepping out a little? Just the two of us? Aren't you ball players supposed to be in training? Who, me? - I don't believe in it. - You don't say! What time do you usually get in? We're supposed to be in by 10:00. It's all right for the others, but I usually get in about midnight. Except, of course, when I have an extra special date. Then I get in about 2:00 or 3:00. Tonight I could stay up until 5:00. Really? Won't Mr. Gilhuly get mad? What I always say is, what the boss doesn't know won't hurt me. You get it, sister? I get it, brother. Here he is. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Miss. Higgins. K. C. Higgins. - I'm afraid I missed you at the station. - I'm sorry. That's all right. We've had a very interesting chat Mr. O'Brien and I. Haven't we? We sure have, Miss Higgins. Just call me "Fathead." Take it easy, now, Eddie. Papa! What's bothering you, Ed? You swing like a rusty gate. - He's lost his batting eye. - Yeah. Mr. O'Brien, you're stepping in the bucket. How's that? I said, "You're stepping in the bucket." Thank you. Maybe you'd like show me how to do it. If you don't mind. I'd like to. Slappy, would you get me the water bucket, please? May I? You see, here's what's happening. Instead of stepping into the ball, like this you're stepping over here and into the bucket. Let me get this straight. When I stand at the plate, I'm like this. No, I hold it a little higher. Up here. You see? And while waiting for the pitch, I wiggle a little bit. Like this. Just to get myself set. Yes, I've noticed that. Now, as the ball comes over try stepping into it as you bring the bat back like. I'm so sorry, Mr. O'Brien. Would you try it, please? Pitch to him, would you, Joe? But easy on that arm. Yeah, easy on the arm. Okay. What a poke! That's four bases in any ball park! That's the idea, Eddie, but don't try to kill them all. You know Charlie Davis of Cincinnati only hit 279 but he batted in 102 runs. Why don't you get Charlie Davis? Cut the cracks, Eddie! Mr. Gilhuly, I seem to have taken over your job. Not at all, Miss Higgins. Please forgive me. I'll see you back at the hotel. Let's get busy! Get around there. Come on, Dennis. Look out! Ain't that something? She's the kind of girl I've always dreamed about. Wouldn't it be wonderful to be married to a girl who played baseball? I remember this time last season, we were playing Scranton. Great town! Anyway there's a dame named Maxine that's kind of sweet on me. A very refined, artistic little chick with plenty on the ball. - A kootch dancer from the circus. - That's what I mean. Goldberg, give me the bread. Anyway, this minx is really warm for me. One night, she's walking me home after the show when all of a sudden I hear a flute playing a kootch dance. You know like this. - Good evening, boys. - Good evening. - Evening, Miss Higgins. - Hello, Denny. Sit down. What do you think it is, a formal affair? Is she gonna eat with us, too? Hey, watch your language, fellows, and your table manners, too. She called me Denny. This may not be such a good idea. You're kind of cramping their style. They're not used to eating with skirts. I mean, ladies. The sooner they get used to seeing me around, the better it will be for all of us. Yes, ma'am. Would someone be so kind as to pass me the bread, please? - Yes, indeed. - With pleasure. Thank you very much. Mind your manners! What's the matter? I had my pinky out, didn't I? Temper, Mr. Zalinka. Temper. Have you boys seen the fashion page in this week's <i>Vanity Fair?</i> There's the cutest pair of pants with a peg top and a narrow bottom if you'll pardon the expression, and the sweetest pair of. Look. We're plastered all over the paper. Pretty nice. O'Brien To Ryan To Goldberg What does it say? - Shall we tell them? - Shall we? By all means. "O'Brien - "To Ryan - "To Goldberg "What a great double play! "The other team never can get to score - "In every inning - "We keep them from winning "Each time that they try for a rally "That's when we save the day "Someone's on first and the game is in doubt "The guy up at bat hits a terrible clout "The dust clears away and they're both of them out - "O'Brien - "To Ryan "To Goldberg - "O'Brien - "To Ryan "To Goldberg "Packs them into the park "The crowds in the bleachers Are there at dawn "They treat us royal Gee-whiz, but they're loyal "One game lasted 17 innings "It was way after dark "We couldn't see a darn thing anymore "We thought the crowd had gone home good and sore "Then out of the back came a deafening roar! "O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg! "Who is the guy who scoops up the ball "And whips it to second base? "O'Brien "And who is the guy who stands on the pill "To first at an awful pace? "Ryan "And who is the guy who tags them at first "With a pitying look on his face? "Mrs. Goldberg's baby boy "Goldberg, Goldberg That's the word for us "My mother always wanted me to play the violin "That dainty little instrument just didn't fit my chin "The night of my recital "I played <i>Ich Liebe Dich</i> "When suddenly a voice rang out: "'Throw that cat a fish!

That's for firemen. For ballplayers too, if you know what's good for you. I know what's good for me. Don't lock the door. I'll be in around 2:00. What's the fine for breaking training? $25. Why? Let's make it $50, shall we? The little dears do need their rest, you know. How much money have you got? Well, in round figures, exactly 38 cents. And you? Checkers. I didn't say nothing. - That's a quarter you owe me. - This could go on all season. - What's eating him, anyway? - The call of the wild, junior. Something's got to be done. Something's got to be done. Take a look. Beautiful, isn't she? Not bad for a dame who can field a hot grounder. "'.

This is what we do. First, we. Fellas come here. Come here! There's one way we can break training without getting into a jam. Take her out on a date. We'll get two other girls and we'll go stepping. I've got a hunch that girl is human. Yes, and guess who she's crazy about? You. Me? Personally? You think so? Sure. Denny, this is it. If she's a dame, she wants romance. And she's a dame. Denny, here's your chance. A touch of her hand, a subtle caress a few tender little nothings whispered in the moonlight. Denny, it's up to you. But I don't know any tender little nothings. It's been my experience, the athletic type like Higgins might go for the caveman approach, like this. Come here. Handle her rough, Denny. Rough? No. What do you want me to do? First, go out on that balcony. Let her see you. Then let nature take its course. Be nonchalant. But I don't know about nonchalant and things like that. Sit on the rail, look up at the moon. Look up at the moon! Never mind the moon. Never mind the moon! Make up your mind. Attract her attention. Cough! Softly, you dope. Hello, Denny. Hello, Miss Higgins. Katherine's the name. Hello, Katherine. What do I do next? What did you say, Denny? I said, what do I do. - Talk to her! - Say something! - Go down and talk to her. - How can I get down? - Get down the tree! - The tree? Go down the tree. Go on. Don't stop now! - Hello, Miss Higgins. - Katherine. Katherine. - It's a lovely night, ain't it? - Yes, it is, Denny. And that's a great big moon, ain't it? Yes, it certainly is. It's a lovely moon. How's that? I said, "It's a lovely moon." Just stopped to think that a lovely night like this and a great big moon, and a girl like. The right girl, Denny. Sure. How would you be able to tell, Denny? I could tell. Right away? Right from the very first time. "I'll hear heavenly music "I'll hear bells start to chime "I'll hear thunder "And I'll be struck with wonder "But I won't have to look "A second time "If her voice is a song "And her walk is a dance "And if her laugh "Is warm and free "If I suddenly seem "To be seeing a dream "She's the right girl for me "If the glow in her eyes "And the light in her smile "Could charm a bird "Right off a tree "I'll be charmed as a bird "And I'll know in a word "She's the right girl for me "She'll have a simple, sweet appeal "That wins my affection "She'll be the kind who'll make me feel "She needs my protection "If the sight of her face "And the touch of her hand "Can make me happy as can be "If my heart says, 'Come in "'Darling, where have you been? ' "She's the right girl. ".for me" That was beautiful, Denny. Beautiful! Miss Higgins, you're wonderful! The way you picked up that grounder was just wonderful. The kid's all right. Yes. It's gonna be a gay social season. There's some little red books in my drawer. Get me Volume 3. Volume 3. One, three. Give me that. We'll get two other girls. We'll be a party of six till we get to town. Then it's every man for himself. Let's see now: Alice, Stella. How about Stella? - Nothing. - Nothing? Let me see. Jesse Davis, I think she owned a horse and buggy. I don't think we'll go out tonight. What do you mean? There's the bag. Hit it hard. - You're out. - Got me. See if you can get it. I'll go to second. I got it. Out. - Wonderful. - That's fun, Denny, but it is getting late. I think I'd better be going. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Of all the stupid. He's probably coming back for his baseball bat. What a spot for a pinch hitter. Pinch hitter? No, not me. I'm poison to her. We've got to get out of here. The social season. The little red book. Remember? - That a boy! - Okay. She's wonderful! She's beautiful! Did you see her figure? Did we see her figure? Wait a minute. What are you gonna do? Take it up where you left off. A fine pal he turned out to be! Come on. Quit worrying! He's just gonna fix it up for you. He is? Really? "If I suddenly seem "To be seeing a dream "She's the right girl for me" Who is it? It's me. O'Brien. May I come up? I hope you'll pardon me, Miss Higgins, but I. There's something on my mind and I. Yes? I'd like to apologize for everything that's happened. I've been behaving like an idiot, haven't I? Yes, you have. I just wanted you to know I was sorry. Fine. Was there anything else? - What? - 'Cause it's getting kind of late. Miss Higgins, don't go in yet. Why not? - Don't spoil it! - Spoil what? The whole picture. The moonlight on the ocean and the garden and the night and you on a balcony. Mr. O'Brien, you're very poetic for a shortstop. Call me Edward. Edward. By the way, what'll I call you? Miss K. C. Higgins? No. What does the "K" stand for? Katherine. That's nice. What does the "C" stand for? Catherine. Two Katherines. They couldn't decide which way to spell it, so they named you twice. That's right. - You sure they're talking about me? - Positive. They're laughing, aren't they? Look, Katherine, Catherine, we're wasting time. Why don't we go for a stroll on the beach in the moonlight? - But don't you think it's a little late? - No. Well, I do. How about tomorrow night? Perhaps. But you'd better go now. Okay. The stairs, please. Goodnight. Goodnight and sweet dreams, baby doll. Kissing her hand! The dirty double-crossing rat! Calm down, will you? He's just kissing her for you. Then what? I suppose she'll kiss him and he'll come back and kiss me? I know I won't like it! Edward. Yes? You broke training tonight just to speak to me. You risked a fine. I'd risk my life. You would? Then I'm sure you won't mind. Mind what? It's going to cost you $50 baby doll. Goodnight. - He's only trying to help you. - Looks like he's helping himself! Wise guy, ain't you? Trying to beat my time? Forget it, will you? You climbed the wrong balcony this time, buddy. - Go away. - Put up your dukes! He walked right into it! Hey, what's all this noise about? You guys should be in bed! - What's the matter with him? - Nothing. They were showing me their new vaudeville act. Yeah, the new vaudeville act. "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? "Deny thy father and refuse thy name. "If thou wilt not be, but sworn my love "And I'll no longer be a Capu." Go to bed, Goldberg! And you, too, Juliet! WOLVES START HEAVY PRE-SEASON TRAINING WOLVES HEAD FOR HOME WILL MEET SENATORS IN OPENER TEDDY ROOSEVELT TO ATTEND OPENER All right, boys, that's it. Come on. What's going on out there, Mike? The boys like to do a little clowning. They do it before every game. The fans eat it up. It looks like the Senators to me, at the right odds. - Three to two? - I'll take $2,000 worth. You've got it. - Who's that skinny little runt? - Denny Ryan, the second baseman. He's cute. And so active for a little fellow. Denny! Hiya. Pleased to meet you. My name's Shirley. Didn't you like it? I don't like to mix clowning with baseball. Maybe I ought to give up baseball and stick to clowning. Mr. President, would you mind posing with this "big stick"? Delighted. Get a nice one in there now. - Come on back. Come on back. - Safe! All right. Send him around now, boys. Strike! - Would you like my opinion? - Play ball. Strike! What's the matter? You blind? Keep your eyes open! Watch them, you robber! Cut it out, O'Brien! - Cut what out? - Riding the umpire. Miss Higgins says you're antagonizing him. So what? He's an umpire, ain't he? I guess she's afraid we'll hurt his feelings. Safe! That's the old boy. - He looks like the winning run. - He's a long way from home. - Strike! - What? Why? Lay off the umpire! So sorry. I almost lost my temper, sir. You'll pardon the suggestion, sir, but I have a cousin in the optical trade. He can get you the finest pair of spectacles wholesale, bifocals, too. Play ball! Give that big mouth of yours a rest! I beg your pardon, but I was not addressing you, stupid. Ball! Thank you, sir. Even you could see that. You're out! - I was safe for a mile! - And I say you're out! I say you're a liar! He never even tagged me. Of all decisions, that's the worst I've ever seen! You blind robber! - You going to take that? - You don't belong here. Umpires always know best! You've been calling them wrong all day, you big burglar, you! That's a very libelous remark. I won't listen to that! Get off the field! - You can't put me off! - Yes, you can, can't you? - Get off. And you are fined $50. - I'm not going to pay it, you crook! - You thief! You robber! - Don't start anything. - You burglar! - Make it $100! - And you keep out of this! - Me? What did I say? Play ball! Certainly, sir. Ball! - What! - Shut up, or I'll put you off the field, too! That was right over the plate. I couldn't even reach that with the big stick. You could use it to match that big head of yours! What'd you say? You heard me. Your ears don't lap over. Your nose don't either, but I could arrange it. Play ball! Ryan, come back! Wait. What do you want, to start something, Buddy? Sure. Cut it out! Break it up! Play ball! He's hurt. They'll trample him. You're out! Give him air. There's $3,000. - Better luck next time. - The season's just started. Look who's here. Easy now. There. - The poor kid. He's out cold. - I'll make him come around. I didn't know you was stuck on the guy. Who's stuck on him? I ain't stuck on him. It's just the mother instinct. That's what it is, the mother instinct. Hey, you. Come here. He's a nice-looking little fellow. Bring him over to the café sometime if he ever wakes up. He's waking up now. Mr. Ryan. What happened? Are you all right? Who are you, anyway? - She owns him. - What? She owns me, too. Can you do that? What happened to me? Who are you? She wants to be your mother. She wants to be my. I'll have to take it up with my father.

We're entertaining a bunch of ball players. I don't get it These boys are a cinch to win. You bet a big chunk of dough against them. I like the odds. They're 4-to-1. But they're unbeatable. So was One Round Delgan until he was knocked cold. - That fight was fixed. You yourself. - You don't say! You sure need fattening up. I don't need anything. Bones. She don't feed you enough, that one. - What one? - The one that owns you. She doesn't own me, and she feeds me plenty. Then she ought to change your formula. Is she your girl? Yes. No. I mean, I don't know. If I was your girl, you'd know. Some people just never appreciate. Appreciate what? Just appreciate. You know, come to think of it, she's really not your type of girl at all. Will you do me a favor, and don't think about it? She's wonderful. Sometimes a person thinks a person is his type of person. Suddenly, he meets another person who turns out to be really his type of person. Do you know what I mean? No. And I don't believe you. Besides, when the right one comes along, I'll know. I'll wait. Say, what's with you and Denny, or am I too personal? Yes, you are. Much too. I have a reason for wanting to know. A personal reason. You've been keeping me awake nights. I have? You have. Indirectly, of course. Denny talks about you in his sleep. Keeps waking me up. Last night, for instance. All of a sudden he woke up yelling "slide, Katherine, slide." Denny even dreams baseball. He wasn't dreaming about baseball. How do you know? Because when I leaned over to wake him up, he embraced me like this and then he kissed me, like this. You're right. It couldn't have been about baseball. That's what I said. Okay, Eddie, okay. Boy, I got to hand it to you. You win. Win what, Nat? Nothing, Miss Higgins. Come on, Nat. What is it, tell me? Something personal between us. I bet him $1 that I'd kiss you before the dance was over. You know something, Eddie? Sometimes I don't get you. Sometimes I don't get myself. - Why'd you tell her? - I didn't intend to. Then why did you? Because she's got Denny crazy about her and she doesn't care that much about him. How do you know? From the way she kissed me. You're kind of mixed up, ain't you, fellow? Kind of. - At last. - At last what, Denny? You know, Katherine. You must know. No, Denny, please. Honest, from the minute you picked up that grounder and threw to third I knew it was love. - No. It, it's just that I don't want you to build up any false hopes. I like you very much but, well. You mean, maybe when the season's over? After we win the pennant? - We'll talk about it then. - Good. Will you do me a favor? Sure. Will you kiss me? Right now. Hard. Kiss you now? - Here? Now? - Right here. No kick in it? No. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Sure, it's all right. I understand. Sometimes a person thinks a person is her type of person and all of a sudden, she finds that that person's really not her type, but another one is her type of person. It doesn't always work that way, Denny. It doesn't always work? - What are you doing spying on me? - Who's spying? I was just watching. Some people just never appreciate. Come here, you. Well, come here. Kiss me. Did it have any kick in it? Good. I was beginning to worry a little bit. Hello, Shirley. Hi. Dennis, you shouldn't have kissed me in front of all these people. What's wrong with Mrs. O'Brien's boy, Eddie? Heart trouble. It looks like heart trouble to me. What Irish lad could sit while the fiddlers are fiddling the pipes are piping, the women are smiling like it's a wedding. You should be leaping in the air, knocking your heels, doing a handsome clog. Come on, get with us! Go to it, Michael, my boy. The Gilhulys were the greatest dancers in all Ireland. This is what sent me over Cockney the night of the Big Wind. Now you can see why the O'Briens were the first kings of Ireland. - Good little hoofer, that O'Brien. - Not a bad shortstop, either. That infield wouldn't be much good without him. - Where did you get that hat? - Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that hat? "'Where did you get that hat? ' Folks ask me every day "'lsn't it a nifty one? ' You often hear them say "Put it on, it's funny Can't you see the people smile "It keeps me busy telling them "The history of this tile "It's the hat my dear old father wore "Upon St. Patrick's Day "Now talk about respect With his head erect "As he marched down old Broadway "'Sure not a man in line Looked half as fine' "My dear old mother used to say "'As your father did In his old-time lid "'Upon St. Patrick's Day' "It's the hat my dear old father wore "Upon St. Patrick's Day "Talk about respect With his head erect "As he marched down old Broadway "'Sure not a man in line Looked half as fine' "My dear old mother used to say "'As your father did In his old-time lid "'Upon St. Patrick's Day "'lt's the hat your dear old father wore "'Upon St. Patrick's Day' "Talk about respect With his head erect "As he marched down old Broadway "'Not a man in line Looked half as fine' "Your dear old mother used to say "'As your father did In his old-time lid "'Upon St. Patrick's Day"' What a wonderful clambake! The most wonderful clambake there ever was! Yeah, wonderful. What's eating you? As if I didn't know. I told you, I'm not interested in Katherine. She's not my type. She's not my type, either. Forget it. Sure, I'll forget it. But you can't forget it. Why don't you quit fighting it, Ed? After all, she's beautiful and she's smart. And she's got a great throwing arm. Great throwing arm? You just didn't look any further. Remember the night we saw her swimming in the pool? Remember? No. "No," he says. In that gold bathing suit. You're drooling. Yeah, but Shirley's my type. Yeah. She's kind of timid and sort of shy. You should've seen me sweep her off her feet. That's what they like, the rough stuff. You got to treat them rough. Caveman stuff. They like that caveman stuff. She hits me over the head with her own club slings me over her shoulder, carries me out of the cave into the woods. And what'd you do? I don't know. I was unconscious. You missed the best part of the dream. You think so? - Mr. Lorgan, how are you? - Fine. I'd like to have a chat with you. I'll get a newspaper. I'll be back in a few minutes. Won't you have a chair, Mr. Lorgan? What's on your mind? I liked the way you handled yourself last night at the clambake. Yes, sir, I liked it a lot. Thank you, Mr. Lorgan. What are you leading up to? A job. I'm thinking of opening up a café. Big, swanky place for the carriage trade. You know, I could use you as a show. That's swell, but what about Dennis? He's my partner, you know. - I think we can work that out. - Good. How much will you pay? You've been getting a lot of publicity. I can double your last vaudeville salary. - It's a deal. - Good. When can you start? Not until after the baseball season's over. Not till then? You don't think I could walk out now, do you? We've practically got the pennant cinched. I'm not interested in baseball. I've got a chorus of girls waiting, ready to start to rehearse. Thirty of them. Thirty girls. A bevy of beauties. I'm sorry you can't make it. Wait a minute. Couldn't you hold off for a while? The baseball season's almost over. I'll tell you what I'll do. Are you going to be in town for a while? Sure. The season finishes here. Couldn't you arrange to get away at nights for rehearsals? No. I couldn't do that. Then there's no use of talking any more. - So long, Eddie. - Wait a minute. Look, I'll do it, but. I'll do it, but keep it quiet, will you? Sure. I wouldn't want to get you in a jam. I'll tell you what. I'll call you tomorrow to tell you when we start rehearsals. - So long. - So long. - So long, fellows. - So long. - How do you know it'll work? - With Eddie? It's a cinch. Didn't you see his face when I told him there'd be 30 chorus girls? Look what one dame did to a guy named Samson. Who was he, a fighter? I'm all set. I'll get the act framed. Then when the season's over, you're in. Of course, I'll have to sneak out every night. You'll cover up for me, won't you? What else can I do? I'm your pal. That a boy! You can't rehearse all night and play ball the next day. A few bad breaks, we can lose the pennant! Quit worrying, will you? I can handle it. I'm in great shape. WOLVES DEFENDING PENNANT LEAD AT HOME Wolves Lead Dwindles Wolves Drop Four Straight Pass me the milk, will you, Ray? "Wolves continue slump in game with Chicago. "The Wolves dropped another game today to Chicago. ".who swept to a 6-5 victory aided by a flurry of last inning hits. ".and three startling errors by." By shortstop, Eddie O'Brien. Go ahead, read it. What's got into him, anyway? The kid's lost his pep. No coordination, no zip. He plays like a tired old man. He ain't tired. He's been hitting the hay early every night. In fact, too early. - That's very unusual for O'Brien. - I should say so. Something's eating him. What do the other boys say? Have they got any ideas? No, not exactly. - Come on, what is it? - It's nothing. If O'Brien stays in this slump, we can kiss the pennant goodbye. So if you have any ideas, open up. Come on. Tell her. It's really got two angles, see? You take a race horse. He's going great, winning every out. But, all of a sudden he starts looking around. He's getting restless, see? What has O'Brien got to be restless about? It's like he says, you take that race horse when he starts looking around he's looking at another nag. With a ribbon in her hair. That sounds like a pretty silly reason for losing ball games. But, if O'Brien wants to chase the girls, let him. Who's stopping him? As long as he keeps decent hours. Yes, that other angle. What else is bothering our little race horse? You. Me? You're the other nag. I'm the. Really? You want me to play up to O'Brien, so we'll win the pennant, is that it? Can you think of a better reason? No, of course not. Personally, I'm only interested in his batting average. I can't rehearse all night and play ball in the afternoon. I need some rest. Get someone else. I'm through. You'll have all next week to rest. I don't care about your ball playing. I've got to get this show set. And I got to play baseball. I feel like a heel letting the team down. That pennant means extra dough to those guys. I don't like that kind of talk. Don't threaten me! I'm not coming down, not tonight or any night. I think that boy needs a little talking to. Hello, Eddie. Hiya. What's your hurry? I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the hay. Wait a minute. Let's have a little talk? Just you and me? Come on. If it's about my batting average, there's nothing left to talk about. That's why I want to get some sleep. That's just it. Maybe you're getting too much sleep. That can happen, too, you know. You see, it's this way. You're just like a horse. I mean, a racehorse. You're all nerves. You're too finely trained and all of a sudden, after you win a race, well you start looking around. What am I looking at? Don't you know? It's a long time since I've been a racehorse. Anyway, Eddie, what I'm trying to say is that maybe you're getting restless. You should relax more. Get out and just bust out. You know? I really think it might do you some good. Get yourself a girl, maybe, and just bust out. What girl am I gonna "bust out" with? I don't know, but if you can't find one there's always me. You? You want to go out with me? You're asking me? It's for the team. Sure, the team. Your batting average, you know. Sure, I know. You've been making errors. Am I making one now? You're the prettiest manager in baseball. You're certainly the prettiest shortstop. I've been a foul ball up to now but it's all gonna be different from here in. Goodnight, Miss Higgins. Eddie, wait. Don't you want to bust out? Right now all that counts is winning that pennant. I'll take a rain check on the other. I'm going to lay that pennant right at your feet. But, baby, when I do, we're gonna bust out in every town in this league. Hello, Eddie. I hope I'm not intruding. Good evening, Miss Higgins. Run along. I'll see you tomorrow. This is why you missed the rehearsal tonight? I thought you said you needed a rest. Rehearsal? What's he talking about? Doesn't she know? He's been rehearsing every night for the past couple of weeks. Rehearsing every night? For a show that I'm putting on. The girls are gonna miss you tonight. They need you badly. - The girls? - Listen, I'll explain all this tomorrow. From now on, they can have him. And the team can get along without him for the rest of the season. Personally, I can get along without him for the rest of my life. I guess I can get along without you, too, Eddie, from now on. It's beginning to penetrate my thick skull. You must've bet a lot of money against the Wolves. The little boy's beginning to get smart. So you played me for a sucker. I had to protect my investment. There's no point in giving you the routine about baseball being a great game, and keeping it clean for the kids. - You'd just be wasting your time. - That's what I thought. Come on. Wolves In Slump As O'Brien Shelved PENNANT PLAY-OFF TODAY Come on, folks. Get a program before the game starts. Program. We want O'Brien. We want O'Brien. Louder! We want O'Brien! This is the guy they need. No, he went all to pieces. What do you mean all to pieces? Anybody can have a slump once in a while. Look. We want O'Brien! Louder. We want O'Brien! We want O'Brien! I knew it was you, Eddie. It's O'Brien, fellas. He's sitting right here. Get in there and play! Nobody asked me. We'll carry you if it'll do any good. Holy smoke! Look, it's Eddie! Hey, Eddie! That a boy, Eddie! What are you going to do? There's nothing to be done. It won't hurt to talk to him. Mike, there's nothing to talk about. He's probably in no condition to play. - Put him out there and see. - We have plenty of time before the game. No. You can talk to him if you want to. That a boy, Eddie! Get in there! If he goes in, we can kiss our $20,000 goodbye. You give up too easily. What are you talking about? What $20,000? - Have you boys been betting against them? - Shut up! O'Brien mustn't play today, boys. - That's it. - Okay. A change in the line-up for today's game. O'Brien at shortstop for the Wolves. Denny, come here. - What are you doing here? - They're gonna get him! - Get who? - Eddie. They're out to get him! - What? - I heard Lorgan and his men talking. They've bet a lot of money against the Wolves. They're bad luck! They won't stop at anything! - You've got to tell Eddie not to play. - He'd play anyway. But you've got to stop him from playing! Sure. Stop him from playing. Yeah, I'll stop him. How about giving them the old routine, the gag? - You got the soft ball? - Right there. Come on, let me have it. Hurry up. Let me have it. Fellas, come here. I think he's hurt. Get a doctor! Is there a doctor? - Looks as if our boy was really hurt. - Yeah. What do you know? - I'm Dr. Winston. - Right here, Doc. - Open up, boys. - Here he is, Doctor. Better get him to the locker room. - Get him up. Take it easy. Go ahead. - Take it easy, boys. There ain't nothing left for us to do. Maybe he's stunned for a few minutes. We must keep him out. They don't know you. Pretend you're doctors and keep O'Brien out. He'll be out, Joe. Take it easy now, boys. - Put him right down here. - Careful with him, very careful. - Give me room, boys. I'm Dr. Karl. - I'm Dr. Stevens. - How is he? - It may be a concussion. Concussion? - Get out of here. We'll take care of him. - Boys, back in the field. Come on, Miss Higgins. He'll be all right. I don't suppose you have a stethoscope with you? Just caught me short. Why don't you run along? We don't all have to be here. Thank you very much. I would like to see the game. What is it? It's 2:10. Run along and enjoy the game. That's a nice fellow. - He's a light sleeper, ain't he? - Yeah. Call it. - Heads. - You win. He's safe! He's safe! - How is he? - They say they may have to operate. What? Denny, what's all this about gamblers? - Who told you? - Shirley did. Don't you start that! I know you knocked him out on purpose. Look, I was in a spot. You don't want a dead shortstop, do you? Why didn't you call the cops? I was scared. Why didn't you tell me? How did I know you were gonna bean him with a hard ball? - Have you seen him? - He's still out. The doctors won't let me in. They're gonna operate. Operate! In there? That's impossible! - That's what they're saying. - I'm going in there. Is it that bad? You hit him next time, will you? My knuckles are getting sore. You can't come in here! - Why not? - Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor! This man's been hurt very bad. Shut the door and get out of here! Those two aren't doctors! Come on, quick. You can't come in here! He's safe. Hold it! Hold it! Enough! He's safe! There they are, Officer! Wait a minute. What's the hurry? Stop him somebody! Denny! Stop him! Just a second. I hardly touched him. I guess I don't know my own strength. - Take him away, fellows. - Come on, boys. All right, play ball! Batter up! Get in there and send Goldberg around. Just watch me. - Slappy, is he still out? - Yeah. I don't think he's seriously hurt, Miss Higgins. He's merely stunned. Darling! Darling, please, look at me! Eddie, can you talk? How do you feel? I feel fine. I feel wonderful. Then you just lie right here and don't you move. Who's moving? Darling, I was so worried when Dennis hit you on the head with the ball. Where is he? I'll murder him! I'll kill him! Let me go! He did it on purpose! No, Eddie, he didn't! Wait a minute! Hold it! Let me at him! Let me at him! Get a hit. You can catch him. Yeah! Give me a bat. I can explain the whole thing. Come on, Eddie! Eddie, stop! Eddie, stop! Wait!

Okay. Hold everything for a new front page! We're jimmying the Allenbury yarn. Hey, Mack, hold everything. Wait for a makeover. - What happened, Allen? - Don't load anymore. - Hold it, boys. - Unload all of them. We're trying to kill a story. Have any trucks gone out? - How about it, Joe? - Number 7. Call him back. But he's gone. Times Square and Columbus Circle. Rush a motorcycle after him. Hurry up! We've got to get those papers back. Every one. Pete, get on your machine and stop truck number 7. Okay. Phone all the stands on that route not to sell any papers. Are you ringing Haggerty? All right, all right! Try him again. - Go to Haggerty's apartment. 52nd Street. - I know where he lives. Won't he be at church? Isn't he getting married at noon? You grab a taxi to the church. Bring him here. - I can't ruin his wedding. - Then it'll be our funeral. Step on it! Keep on ringing him. Don't answer it. I've had enough gags pulled on me this morning. Maybe Miss Benton again. I'm afraid. You're afraid? I'm marrying her, and you're afraid. That's loyalty. She say before, "If you're late, she going tear down church." Even that won't stop it. No, Ching, I promised I'd meet her at the altar at the stroke of 12:00. And there'll be no reprieve from the governor this time. - I hope you'll be very happy. - Yes, said the spider to the fly. - Very pretty. - I'm the groom, not the bride. Take my advice, Ching. Don't ever get married. Maybe not so bad, Mr. Haggerty. My mother and father, they get married. You're kidding. Here's to the last mile. A merry marriage and many happy comebacks. Mr. Haggerty! - What's wrong? - You're wanted at the office right away. Good old governor. Good old office! Run to the church and tell Miss Benton I've been delayed. It's awful to bust up your wedding. Never mind the wedding. Something break? - The story they had to kill. - What story? The London correspondent cabled last night. A swell story on the Allenbury girl. Connie Allenbury? What kind of story? She was mixed up in some scrape at a garden party. Tried to steal another girl's husband. - Not Connie Allenbury? - Yes, sir. All right, what happened? Jackson cabled this morning. It was all a mistake. It was somebody else. She wasn't at the party. And we printed the story? Holy mackerel! Come on. Wait. You said not to stop for anything. but you've got to have your pants. Yeah, yeah. I gotta have my pants. Can't I stay away for one day without somebody pulling a boner? You call yourself a newspaperman. Where's your nose? - My nose? - Yes, your nose! That thing fairly reeks of alcohol! Jackson was drunk. You got to smell things like that. You don't need any brains. All you need is a nose! - I knew the boss hated her father. - And her father hates us! He'd blow us up, and you hand him dynamite. The one girl that we should handle with kid gloves. and you spread her name over the front page! What? - What'll we use for a headline? - I don't care. "War threatens Europe!" - Which country? - Flip a nickel! Yes, sir. The boss is here. He wants you right away. Does he want me or my job? Have you got a drink? There's a fresh bottle on your desk. I thought you'd need one. I'll need it, and how. I knew I'd find you with a drink in your hand. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? What? Didn't Ching tell you? Yes, Ching told me, and I told him, and now I'm telling you. I won't stand for it. You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty. Not to me! First it was a fire at sea. Then it was a kidnapping. - What's the gag this time? - Darling, there's no gag. - The newspaper's made a mistake. - So has little Gladys. Engaged to a newspaperman. Joe Simpson never treated me like this. - Then why did you divorce him? - I've asked myself that many times. Gladdie, after all, you got no kick. I haven't? First, you said a trip to Bermuda. - You went to Bermuda. - But alone. Then it was Europe. If I wait another year, it'll be Little America. I won't. - I tell you, I can't get away. - It's not Europe. It's the church. It only takes 20 minutes to get married. - But, Gladdie, the trip. - I'll take Battery Park. I'm going to take you on the greatest trip a girl ever had. just as soon as we settle the suit. Nothing doing. For two years I played second fiddle to this paper! But the boss is waiting for me. The preacher's waiting, too. Get your hat. I can't go. the paper's in a jam! We're facing a libel suit! You're facing a breach of promise suit! If you don't want to marry me, say so! Gladdie, you're getting yourself all upset, darling. - A little drinkie, maybe? - Not today I don't. Today, I get married! - Well, l. - Didn't they say I wanted to see you? Say, what is this? Do I own a paper or a lunatic asylum? - You just took the words out of my mouth. - Mr. Bane, my future wife. Nonsense! I'll be in my office! Get rid of this woman! Take it easy, that's the owner of the paper. I don't care who he is. Nobody talks to me like a house detective. How do you know how a house detective talks? Don't you think I read? Where are you. No, you don't. If you think that you can. Gladdie, darling. Now, you tell the preacher to wait. and I'll phone you just the minute I'm free, and we'll get married today. Now, that's a promise. Tomorrow at this time, you'll be a married woman. I swear to it. Joe, come here. Will you show Miss Benton to a taxi? And this is supposed to be the happiest day of a girl's life. Yes, ma'am. Why doesn't London answer? I want J. B. Allenbury. This is terrible, Haggerty. - A mistake like that can ruin. - What do the lawyers say? An open-and-shut case. Pure libel and slander. We haven't a leg to stand on. And now, I've got to get on my knees to Jim Allenbury. a man I fought for 20 years, never giving an inch. They're ready with London, Mr. Bane. Wait a minute. Let me talk to him. You know how he hates you. I'll take all the blame. You know nothing, not even that I'm phoning. - Then if I fail. - You mustn't. Tell him it was just a mistake. Maybe he doesn't know anything about it. Only 50 of those papers got away. Hello? Hello, London? Yeah, we're ready. Hello? Hello, Mr. Allenbury? This is Warren Haggerty of the <i>New York Evening Star.</i> You know the <i>Star?</i> Well, I'm sorry you feel that way about us, Mr. Allenbury. Yes. I realize that we've fought in the past. but it's always been a good, clean fight. No. Nothing serious. But the early edition of the paper carried a little item about your daughter. Not that the item was serious at all, but I just thought I'd phone you. Yes. Yes, that's it, exactly. The spirit of fair play. I appreciate that spirit of fair play, Mr. Haggerty. but you see, my office cabled me a copy of your little item. What? Yes, indeed. Hardly what I'd call innocent. but typical of Hollis Bane and everything that his newspaper stands for. No, I'm not interested, Mr. Haggerty. You can discuss that with my attorney. Now, hold on a minute. This is Charles Archibald, of Archibald, Davis, and Wingert. We're filing suit immediately through our New York office. - You'll receive the papers tomorrow. - Just a minute, Mr. Archibald. Don't forget to mention the amount we're suing for. That should interest them. By the way, you might inform your Mr. Bane. Miss Allenbury is asking damages for $5 million. $5 million. She's insane, she's mad. There never has been a libel suit for $5 million. There ain't that much money. She's got all the money in the world now. It's not money they're after. It's the paper. It's me. For 20 years, I've fought Allenbury. Kept him out of the senate. And when they wanted to make him ambassador, I stopped it. - $5 million. - Their chance to strike back, and they are. The paper will go. Look what a lawsuit did to <i>New York Daily</i> last year. That's not going to happen to us. We haven't begun to fight yet. We've been sued before, big suits. They were after money and were glad to settle. Allenbury will settle, too, when we get through with her. Remember the Farrell girl? That was open-and-shut, till we got busy on her. You can't do that here. There's never been a word of scandal about Connie Allenbury. Not yet, but she's human and I'm gonna throw a man at her. You're not suggesting a frame? No. But we've got to get to this girl. and I'm gonna bring in the best man we ever had. Who's that? A guy that will beat anybody in the world. from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler. Bill Chandler? Yes. Now, you fired him, the best man we ever had on libel. - You admit it, and you fired him. - Yes, and I'd do it again. He was a vain, double-crossing heel. Tried to run the paper. - Thought he knew more about it than I did. - And was right. He's the only man who can swing this case. Get him! I'll have him here in an hour. Long distance. New York calling Mr. Adams. of <i>The Chronicle</i> at Washington, DC. All right, put Haggerty on. Hello, Haggerty. This is Adams of <i>The Washington Chronicle.</i> Chandler left here over a year ago, headed for Denver. Try <i>The Courier.</i> Sure, I know him. Chandler left Denver four months ago. And the boss's wife almost followed him to San Francisco. That guy is dynamite. He worked here, but he wasn't with <i>The Express</i> two weeks. when he quit and left San Francisco. One of the girls here received a Christmas card from Singapore. Anyone in this great settlement knowing the whereabouts of William Chandler. will please communicate with station ZHM, Singapore. Keep the lines open. If anything comes in, let me know. I'll be here. He left Singapore three months ago. How about Australia? I can try Sydney. He was always crazy about the races. Okay, but rush it. Send another SOS to the syndicated press. and cable London and Berlin. - Do anything, but find him. - Maybe that guy's dead. It would be just like him to die at a time like this. Hello. In case you don't know it, it's 2:00 in the morning, and I've been asleep. What do I do? Put the dress in mothballs for another trip? Change it for a straitjacket and order one for me. - You ought to get some sleep, boss. - No. This coffee will fix me up all right. I press suit up quick. Maybe you try him again this afternoon. - Throw him in the nearest ashcan. - One trail leads to Sydney. The other one to Shanghai. Both report the whereabouts of Bill Chandler unknown. Call up that detective agency, see if they can find him. Chandler? You mean Mr. Chandler. - the fellow who used to work here? - Yes. - I know where he is. - What? Sure, he's a good friend of mine. Just last week, he gave me $10 for my mother. - She's been sick. - What's his address? He's at the Grand Plaza. The Grand. No, that can't be the Chandler we want. Don't you mean Bill Chandler. who was always giving you the raspberry? Yeah! That's the fellow! Tell the cable office we found him. - Right under my nose! - Shall I get him? No, I want to talk to him personally, feel him out a little. So he's living at the Grand Plaza. He must be in the money. Warren Haggerty. From Brooklyn to Bombay. a stab in the back spells Haggerty. I never stabbed you in the back, Chandler, and I want. After all, that was a long time ago, and we should. Bury the hatchet. Or was it a knife? - Now get this, Chandler, I didn't knife you. - You only tried to. That was two years ago. We should. - Let bygones be bygones. - Why, sure. Whatever happened. Is all over now. Goodbye. It was nice to see you. Good morning. Cigarettes, please. Give my regards to the boys at the office. You still at the <i>Star?</i> Old man hasn't gotten wise to you yet. Soon, you'll be out on your ear. then the <i>Star</i> will be a first-class sheet. Listen here, Chandler. If you're. By the way, what are you doing for yourself, Bill? I just finished writing a book, Warren. All about my early hardships, the newspaper business. and the rats I met running about. - Lf you mention me in that book. - Sue me for libel. How is the libel these days? You got a good man on the hush stuff? Yeah, we get along. Where did you go when you left us? The intelligence department, Warren. I always did like contrast. Cheerio. - What's your hurry? - Breakfast time. - It can wait. I got an idea. - I'll take breakfast. I want to talk to you. Warren, you weren't like that when I left. - This is a proposition. - Not before breakfast. - I haven't got time for breakfast. - That's too bad. Goodbye. - Good morning, captain. - Good morning, sir. - Table for one. - Table for two. Very well, sir. This way, please. - More coffee, sir? - No, thanks. Now, Warren, what's on your mind? I've been thinking, Bill. After all, you're a darn good newspaperman. Maybe I was a little hasty when l. You don't mean to give me back my job? - That's it. - Wait a minute. You want to talk business? All right, I'll talk. You're in a jam over the Allenbury girl. You printed a hot story and she's suing you. - Who told you? - Elementary, my dear Watson. I read the story. First edition only, carried by no other paper. That, says I, is the fine Italian hand of Haggerty. the bull in the china shop. - What's she asking? - $5 million. Who does she think she is? Just one of the richest girls in America. Yes, I know all about her. Title-crazy, with a fatheaded old father to buy her in and out. America's international playgirl. That's her rep. and she thinks it's worth $5 million. When I get through with her, she'll take five cents. - Done. You're on the payroll. - No, Warren. No philanthropy. During the six months that I was on the <i>Star,</i> I saved you, all told. some $300,000. What did I get? $125 a week. That's the proposition, drawn yesterday. I've been expecting you for 24 hours. $5,000 down and $45,000 more when you. Why, you're crazy. No other reporter gets that much money. It's robbery. All right. Forget it. You read any good books lately? - Now, be reasonable, Bill. - Take it or leave it. Wait a minute. On second thought, I don't want the job at any price. I got all the money I need right now. Look here. I just got this from my publisher. offering to advance me $5,000 for a second book. - Let's just forget about this. - Now, wait a minute. You ought to be arrested for extortion. You must have dropped this, sir. - What is this? - That is a letter. I get it. So your publisher is going to send you a $5,000 advance? $700 behind with the hotel, you mean. - Not now, I'm not. - I knew I was a sap to believe. That's right, you were. But you'll get your money's worth. Now, here's the plan. Allenburys are in London. So I sail for England at once. But they're coming back in 10 days. That's why I'm sailing, to come back with them. Five days on a boat. Anything can happen on a boat. I meet the girl. Perhaps she comes to my cabin. - No. Not this girl. - Only for a cocktail. Perfectly innocent to her, me, and everyone on the boat. Except our private detective, who radios my wife. - You got a wife? - No. This is a setup, not a confession. But we hire some attractive girl to marry me. and when the time comes. she stages a pretty little scene over her erring husband. and sues Connie for alienation of affection. That's it, that's it. The <i>Star</i> called Connie a husband-stealer. She denies it. We duplicate the situation. This time, she does steal a husband. This time, we're right. Let her go to bat with a libel suit and see what she collects. But how about a girl to marry you? Do you know anybody? Now, that's tricky. We've got to find someone we can trust. I've got the girl, the very girl! Hello. What happened to you? Do I want to get married? What do you think? I'll call the preacher right away. The city hall? Then I can't wear my wedding gown. I won't ask any questions. And don't keep me waiting. Tiny? Tiny, come here. I'm so happy. Today is my wedding day. What, again, Miss Gladys? You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty. Not to me! Let me out of here. For two years, you've had me on a merry-go-round. waiting for that gold ring, but this is where I get off. - and stay off! - Be quiet. I won't be quiet! The things I've taken for that newspaper. but this gets the blue ribbon, trying to marry me off. to that baboon! Let's not deal in personality. But, darling, it's only for a month, maybe less. Then six weeks in Reno. And, Miss Benton, they've got the loveliest place in Reno. You'd love it. You can play craps there every night. That's right, that's right. I'll come the moment you get divorced. But I don't want a divorce. I want to get married and stay married. If you don't want to marry me, say so. Of course I want to marry you, but don't you understand, Gladys? This comes first. It's our only chance. I'll get fired. There isn't a newspaper in the world. that would hire me as an office boy. Would they, Bill? - Not if they know you like I do. - What do you mean? You remember poor Ed Glover? You remember after he lost that libel suit? They found his car gone over a cliff and a revolver in his hand. - Do you want me to kill myself? - Did you change your insurance? Would I ask you to do this thing for me. if I didn't consider you practically my wife? Would you ask your wife to hook up with that ape? The ape objects. Darling, you're not marrying him, really. A wedding ceremony, six hours in a hotel apartment. during which time I'll never leave you, and then he leaves for Europe. - Don't talk to me. I'm leaving. - Wait a minute. I'm leaving. The deal is off. Here's your contract. $50,000. - I wouldn't hook up with her for $1 million. - Now, Bill, you know the spot I'm in. That's your tough luck. You'll have to get a new boy. - You mean you're walking out on him? - That's it, sister. You know what the <i>Star</i> means to him. you're a newspaperman. You know. It'll ruin his life. It'll ruin his career. A fine friend you are. - Lf you put it that way. - I'm putting it that way. - Good. I'll get the guy. - The things I do for that newspaper. "And I pronounce you man and wife." Aren't you going to kiss the bride? Yes! Sure. May I? Why not? Everybody else seems to be doing it. Aren't you going to kiss me? Sure, sure. An old friend of the family. Yes. Darling. Very old friend. I hope you'll be very happy. and don't forget to invite me to your silver anniversary. It'll have to be within the next six weeks. Goodbye, and good luck. Goodbye. Good luck to you. - Take his arm. - I'm taking your arm. Yes. Send it up, and send a waiter, please. Right away? Thanks. That's the wire you sent me. There will be a bellboy and a waiter to witness the very tender scene. when we learn that I'm called to Europe. Now, remember, won't you? You're all broken up. He is torn from your arms, the bridegroom of an hour. - That's too long for me. - To my little bride. I hope you choke on it. - Darling. - Don't call me that. You know what my name is. - Of course, Mrs. William Chandler. - I'd just as soon have a number. - Come on, now. You mustn't fight. - Why not? We're married. You're supposed to be happily married. You're supposed to be in love with each other. I must have been crazy to let you marry me off to another guy. But let me tell you this, Warren Haggerty. From now on, you've got to forget the paper and take me places. I can't take you places, you've got to stay in the apartment. You can sew, sleep, and play the radio. - Maybe you could learn to read. - You're not going to take me out? Honey, I can't take you out. You can't be seen running around with another man. You're supposed to be married. You've got to look married. Maybe twins would help. Now, remember, remember. - Yes? - Telegram for Mr. Chandler. - Just wait. Clear the table, please. - Yes, ma'am. Bill, there's a telegram for you. Thanks, sweetness. Would you open it for me, honeykins? Bill. - What is it? - Read it. - What does it say? - It's from the office. "Lmperative you sail <i>Queen Anne</i> tonight for director's meeting in London. "Reservations arranged. Anderson will meet you. Bon voyage." You can't leave me. Bill, you mustn't leave me! Baby, this is terrible, breaking into our honeymoon like this. But what am I to do, honey? I'll have to go. You can't. It's only for a couple of weeks, Mrs. Chandler. But a couple of weeks are a couple of weeks! - I'll miss my little Billikins. - And I'll miss my little fuzzy-face. I'm afraid you'll have to hurry if you're gonna make that boat. Yes, that's right. Here, boy. Just take my grips here. These leather ones are mine. Sure was a lucky thing that I didn't unpack. Waiter, thank you very much. Darling, I'll miss you every minute. Every second! Hold it. They've gone. Save it for the elevator. - Well, for the. - Here comes the elevator. The bride and groom. Darling, I'll miss you every minute. Every second. Goodbye, old man. He's gone. The maid. Why, he'll come back, Mrs. Chandler. - How do you do, Mr. Chandler? - Hello. - Sailing back with us so soon, sir? - I only came to London for three days. - Lf there's anything I can do, sir. - Thank you. Everything is set. Palmer's gonna take the smack. Fine. Tell the boys to lay it on heavy. Here they come. Beat it. I'll see you on the boat. Boys. Here they come now. Chandler says lay it on heavy. Mr. Allenbury, excuse me, sir. There's been a bit of a mix-up on your baggage. - Come with me. - Shall I attend to it? I'd better go with you, Graham. Wait here, Connie. Will you make a statement for the press? Are you suing for L1 million? - What are your chances of winning? - I've nothing to say. Miss Allenbury, you must be able to tell us something. - No, nothing. - Surely, you'll make a statement. Will you please let me go? - You can't afford to ignore the press. - Can't I? Turn her around, Palmer. Take your hands off of me! Watch the dicky bird, ducky. Just a minute. Obviously, the young lady doesn't wish to be photographed. That's none of your affair. Now, clear out, all of you! Hello. Connie, are you all right? Yes, dear, I'm all right. This is an outrage. You men ought to be arrested. We'll fix him. That was William Chandler, the author. - Remember that name, Graham. - Yes, sir. William Chandler. I ought to have charged that blighter L10 instead of L5. Come in. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Allenbury's compliments. Will Mr. Chandler join him for cocktails before dinner? - Mr. Allenbury? - Mr. J.B. Allenbury. The lady you rescued from those reporters today is Mr. Allenbury's daughter. Yes. I'll be delighted to have cocktails with Mr. Allenbury. - 7:30, the Grill Room bar. - 7:30. Thank you. - You rang, sir? - Yes. Steward. do you know if they have any books in the ship's library on angling? - Angling, sir? - Yes. You know, trout fishing? Yes. We have several. Shall I fetch you one, sir? Yes, just bring me all of them. - All of them, sir? - Yes. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake. Taupo. Lake Taupo, New Zealand. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Lake Taupo. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Now, the best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Yes. Mr. Allenbury has been delayed by a ship phone call from America. - but he asked that you order. Do sit down. - Thank you. We appreciated what you did this morning. Most unfortunate. - Here's Mr. Allenbury. - Sorry to be late, Mr. - Chandler. - Chandler. Have you ordered? - A dry martini, please. - The same. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Did we hear from the bank? - Complete accounting. And Jennings, shall he meet you in Washington? No, he'd better come to New York and fly down with me. That's the only time that I'll have. Be sure that the plane is ready. - It's ordered for noon. - Good. Now, young man, I want to thank you. for what you did this morning, both for my daughter and myself. - Quick thought on your part. - I rather enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, newspapers and I are not very good friends. One time in Chicago, I sent a reporter to a hospital. - My publishers never forgave me. - Publishers? Yes. I'm a writer. Indeed? Just now, I'm doing some fishing yarns. Really? Yes. Well, Father? Connie, my dear, I wasn't. - I want you to meet Mr. - Chandler. Mr. Chandler. The man who saved your life. Yes, indeed. Thank you so much. I thought you were with those people from Plymouth. I ran out on them. I simply can't be bothered with people you meet on boats. I'm glad that we met on the dock. - A mint frappé. - Yes, miss. I should apologize for the scene I caused. Waiter, never mind. I won't have any. Mr. Charmers. - Chandler. - Mr. Chandler is a writer. How amusing. What do you write? Father, guess who's with us. Mrs. Burns-Norvell, and that dreadful daughter of hers. We elude them in Europe, and now we meet them on the same boat. Now we're in for it. They'll be asking us to dinner. Not if we see them first. I've been ducking them all day. Are you having fun, Mr. My plane. Father, did you cable about my plane? - Leave it in storage. I've chartered one. - But I want my own. I'm dying to feel the stick in my hands again. Do you fly, Mr. Charmers? Chandler. Oh, yes, I've. I've flown across with Lindbergh a couple of times. But my favorite sport is fishing. Sorry, Mr. Allenbury, it's 7:30. Thank you for joining us. If ever we need your help again, I hope you'll be on hand. It's been so nice to see you. Good evening. Here they are, Mother. Connie! Connie, my dear! We've been looking for you all over the boat. My dears! It's so nice to see you both again. Bert will be so pleased that we're crossing together. - How are you, Mrs. Burns-Norvell? - And you're joining us for dinner. I won't take no. It's my birthday, I'll be 21 at midnight. - I'm very sorry. - No, no excuses. We'd love to, but you see, Connie. I'm sorry if I'm late, J.B., but I had to send a very important wire. Shall we go in to dinner now? - Yes. - We're dining with Mr. Charmers. Mrs. Burns-Norvell and her daughter, Barbara. How do you do? Can't we all have dinner together? - They're going to talk business. - Yes. You see, I'm a writer. and Mr. Allenbury and I are doing a book together. But too wonderful! You must tell me all about it tomorrow. - I'm always up for lunch. - Yes. Well, we're indebted to you again. Thanks. That was fast thinking. I suppose we'll have to have dinner together now. Shall we? Three, sir? Father, you're in luck. Your favorite fish, brook trout. Do you care for trout? Do I care for trout? The one thing in the world that I care for is trout. in any shape or form. Especially on the end of a line. You're an angler? I'm on my way now to Glen Arden. all set to prove they'll rise to a Parmacheene Belle. No, not this early. A Royal Coachman, perhaps. Or maybe a Pink Lady by visible, but not a Parmacheene Belle. - I've caught them. - Not at Glen Arden. I know. I've fished Glen Arden. I've tried it. Father. shall we say trout? What a sport. To feel the trout on your line. to play him, to reel him in. - There's no thrill in the world like it. - Just one that beats it. When you first see him. Not yet on your hook, but rising to the bait. I stand corrected. I remember once, in the high Sierras, I was using a Wickham's Fancy. - No, a grizzly wing. - Father. for two hours we've had nothing but fish. My dear, I was only telling him about my trip to the Sierras. Perhaps you'd like to dance? Shall we? - Did you ever fish the Rockies? - Have I? Fisher Falls. Gluckman's Point. Gluckman's Point? I'm afraid that dancing isn't exactly my line. I should say it was part of your line. - May I be frank, too? - Why not? You dance superbly. I was hoping for something original. Dear, life is so full of disappointments. - Sorry. - Just the lurch of the boat. Afraid I wasn't concentrating. It was your eyes. Beautiful, aren't they? They remind me. Yes, I know. Sparkling diamonds, deep sapphires. No, they remind me of angry marbles. Connie, darling! You must have luncheon with us tomorrow, promise? I've a bone to pick with you. I'm afraid l. I'm sorry, but we can't work on our book without Connie. She's our inspiration. I thought that was rather clever. Yes. I thought you thought so. Don't I get a vote of thanks? Oh, by all means. It just dawned on me that I seem to have made myself. a permanent member of your party. Yes. It's dawned on me, too. Shall we sit down? So, you've fished Gluckman's Point? You're an angler, all right. I should say Mr. Chandler is quite an angler. Will you both excuse me? I'm quite tired. - See you tomorrow. - I think not. I'm going to read books the rest of the trip. - You're not ill, my dear? - Oh, no. That'll give you a chance to talk fish till New York. I could talk fish from here to Shanghai. Couldn't you, Mr. Chandler? Yes, yes, and back again. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, dear. Good night, Mr. Chandler. Don't keep father up too late with your fish stories. Gluckman's Point? Glasses? How do I look? Nobody in the world will know you. Fine. That's the idea. Catching up on your reading? Remember me? Oh, yes. I just left Father. He's enjoyed his three-day fish fest. So have I. - He's waiting for you. - He won't mind waiting. You don't know Father. You know the man. I know the angler. It's nice you have so much in common. I won't detain you. Goodbye, Mr. Chandler. Goodbye. You've got to help me. I'm in a bit of a jam with the Burns-Norvells. I've been trying to duck them, but they finally caught me. Cocktails and dinner tonight. How nice. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Wait a minute, now. It's your turn to come through for me. After all, I inherited them from you. I'm going to tell them that you and your father. will also join me for cocktails before dinner. Mr. Chandler, you think of the sweetest things. Now when the Burns-Norvells arrive. - you come in without your father. - Father gets all the breaks. And announce that he wants to see me right away. A brilliant idea for our book. and that we'll have to work the whole evening. See, could you do that? Good, then cocktails in my stateroom at 7:00. - In your stateroom? - Yes. You see, the bar is too near the dining room. Oh, I see. - Your stateroom at 7:00? - That's right. - Splendid. - All right. Until then. 7:00. She'll be alone with me in my stateroom. Give us about 10 minutes. Swell. How did you manage it? She thinks I've invited a lot of other people. How do you do? Are we late? Late? So sweet of you to send a message by Connie. asking us to have cocktails with you. She asked you to. She said that you were too bashful to ask us yourself. Where is Miss Connie now? - We needn't worry about Connie. - We forgot to tell you. Connie isn't coming. She has another headache. Mr. Chandler? Where are you? - Hello. - The inevitable Mr. Chandler. - How was the cocktail party? - Delightful. So sorry I couldn't come. I trust the Burns-Norvells consoled you. I found them very charming. Far superior to many people one meets on boats. Yes. Babs is one girl in a million. And so rich, too. - Or didn't you know that? - At least she has good breeding. Then. - Everything went off all right? - Oh, yes. In fact, I'm glad now that you didn't come. You are? Why this change of heart? You're so fragile. - Fragile. - Yes, you damage so easily. - Damage? - Sues for $5 million. That fascinates me. Asks $5 million damages. - So the Burns-Norvells told you. - It gave me a new light on you. Who is this marvel, I said, Florence Nightingale? Jeanne d'Arc? What has she done to earn such a precious reputation? - Found a cure for death and taxes? - Aren't you being a little absurd? - Aren't you? - Wait a minute, you don't understand. Do be careful. It might break. I'm not accustomed to handling anything so delicate, so valuable. That should be touched only by royalty, dukes or earls. As a matter of fact, you should be kept under glass. And that is the last I saw of Miss Connie until we reached New York. Five days on a boat, and she slaps your face. - That's fine progress. - So the wonder boy lays an egg. - Would you hush your girlfriend? - Say, listen, nobody's hushing me. I've got my ticket to Reno, my reservations at the hotel. - and even my lawyer. - Postponed only. A million-to-1 we'll never see them again. You lose. He's already invited me for a weekend of fishing. Just you and the father? What do I do, bust in on you and the old man? Connie will be there. I'll take bets on that, too. That wasn't any farewell slap. - When? - We're driving up tomorrow. Perfect. Alone in the mountains, away from the world. The next night, Gladys and I. No. I'd better stay away. - Just Gladys. - What, alone? And a detective. Connie rushes from her room. You come from yours, follow her down. - What'll I wear? - Flashlights! The case is in the bag. Nice work. I knew you'd deliver. I think I'll wear the pink. I look awful cute in pink. - There's only one hitch. - Hitch? - Fish. - Fish? I've told him fish stories that would curl your hair. and I've never even had a rod in my hand. - I'll have an instructor here in the morning. - In the morning? Him? Here? Where am I supposed to be? Now, it'll be all right, Gladys. - You're gonna leave me here alone? - I'm here. It'll be all right. It's just a business arrangement. It's mighty funny business, if you ask me. Where are you going? To get some bedclothes. I'm sleeping out here. You see, it'll be all right. Bill out here and you in there. Do you mean to tell me that you're willing for me, your fiancée. - the girl that you love. - Please. I've done plenty for you and the <i>Star.</i> but there's a time to draw a line, and I'm drawing it. I trust Bill like he was a brother. Yeah, but he isn't my brother. He can't even speak politely. - He insults me with every breath he takes. - Pipe down. You'll hurt his feelings. Bill, I'll have that fisherman here the first thing in the morning. The first false move, I'll leave. Unless I'm cuckoo, I'll be out before midnight. It'll be all right, darling. Good night, Bill, good night. - Good night, darling. - Good night, old man. Hello? Flowers? On the way up? Oh, yes. Thanks. Open the door, will you? There are some flowers on the way up. We gotta get these bedclothes out of here. Hurry up! I've lost the keys. Good morning. Where did you get that key? The front-door key always fits both doors. - You mean that key was there all night? - Naturally. - For Mrs. Chandler. - Of course, just wait a minute. For me, Billikins? Yes, my little fuzzy-wuzzy. They're lovely. Thank you, sugar pie. How did you know white roses were my favorite flowers? What? Haggerty sent those. Haggerty never sent me flowers before. No? It's all part of the plan. I'm gonna get some breakfast. I thought the plan was to stay here and look married. - Lf you don't mind. - I don't mind if you don't mind. I don't mind if you. Who started this? What do you want for breakfast? Breakfast. You know, fruit. Will you have some more coffee, Bill? No. This certainly looks married, a little too married to suit me. I'm sorry. Here, have a piece. - Try the funnies. - No, I wanna talk. You do? Well, all right, let's talk. - Who goes first? - I'll start. You are a strange egg. - I bet you say that to all the boys. - I'll get it. - Good morning. Mrs. Chandler? - Yes. I'm Evans from the Angler Supply Company. - I've bought some supplies. - Bring them right in. And this is Mr. Chandler. Good morning, Mr. Evans. I've brought everything, a complete outfit. You'll have no trouble learning to fish with this equipment. No, sir. The elbow low and close. Muscle has nothing to do with it. It's the natural spring of the rod, sir. Too bad I'm not fishing for curtains. I'd be sensational. Now suppose you break your leg, then you can stay home. That's what I call constructive. I was just trying to help. Now, a little patience, sir. Try again. And remember. - the elbow low and close. - Low and close. Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir. Keep it easy and fluid. like rippling water. This way, sir. Darling, don't you want to powder your nose or something? And miss this? Not for the world, sweetheart. Pretend there's a 5-pound beauty in yonder pool. just behind the jutting boulder. Mrs. Chandler, would you mind stepping down here to the corner of the table. - and bending over? - Now I'm a jutting boulder. I'll be a tall, spreading tree just behind you. Don't forget the wrist. Remember, there's a man on second. I know I'm never gonna get this. I was never cut out to be an angler. Look, this is the way I would do it. - You did it, sir. - I'll say he did it. And how. That cast, sir. Why, not one angler in 50. can master the underhand stroke. - Underhand is right. - You mean it's all right? It's perfect, sir. Could you do it again? - Not with this boulder, he can't. - Like a backhand at tennis. - Perfect, sir. - Yeah? This is what makes life worth living. A breath of this early morning air is worth all the medicine in the world. Certainly is. We're not keeping you up, are we? Me? No. I'm always up at the crack of dawn. Here we are, Chandler. My favorite spot. How do you like it? Fine, splendid. Very much like the Lake Taupo country, New Zealand. Go ahead, we'll give you the first cast. Yes. I tell you. I think I'll go on up the way. where the ripples are faster and the brush is sparser. This is going to be good. I still bet he can't fish. Nonsense. He's the best-informed man on angling I've ever met. - Father, darling, you're a sucker. - Now listen to me, young lady. I know a first-class angler when I see one. Yes, and a first-class man, too. - Lf he's first-class, I'll travel steerage. - What did you come up here for? You had a weekend all planned in town. I didn't want to see my favorite father tossed to a wolf. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about that. He's after something, and it isn't fish. Look at those new togs. A new rod. Watch this. Great guns! I take it all back. He's good. Good? He's magnificent. I wish I could master that underhand cast. I've got one. A beauty. So have I. I've got his brother. Another one! Not having much luck, are you, Mr. Chandler? I'm surprised you're not catching any fish, Mr. Chandler. It won't be long now. I wonder if Mr. Chandler's having any luck. Don't worry about him. He's a real outdoor man. Dad, look! Walleye! He's hooked Walleye! But he'll never land him. He'll never land him. Reel him. No. Let him play. Give him some line. Reel him out. Reel him. Here, hold his head up. Don't net him. Don't net him. You did! Boy, what a beauty. - How'd you do it? - I just followed the book. The hook. Walleye. You've got Walleye. - Who? - Walleye. The biggest, most elusive trout in Glen Arden. We've been fishing him for two years and you got him. - It was nothing. - Nothing, you say? But I'm ashamed of you, spoiling his sport with a net. Nine-tenths of the fun is reeling him in. I know. I'm sorry. I was so excited. Unhook him. - What? - Yes. - Unhook him. - Yes. That is, no! You invited me up here, so you should have some of the glory. - So you unhook him. - I don't like to spoil your fun. No. That's quite the contrary. There's plenty of glory to go all around. It's mighty sporting of you to let me do this. Not at all. I think a toast is in order, if you don't mind. Hear, hear. To Walleye, king of trout. How have the mighty fallen. Undone by a Parmacheene Belle. and I thought his weakness was a Pink Lady. Another batch coming up. Say, you certainly have a way with the griddle! - She's a remarkable girl. - I'm beginning to think you're right. - I resent the understatement. - Just a spoiled brat. - Service. - Yes, sir. Coming up. Bulls eye! Never miss. Queen of the flapjacks. - Father? - I must think of my figure. A 20-minute walk, if you can spare me, then eight hours of sleep. - But we need help, Father. - No more for me. Where's my pipe? Alex? Lmagine, you and a flapjack. How'd you ever get together? And they laughed at me when I sat down on the griddle. I still think it's a trick. Nothing in my hands. Nothing up my sleeves. I know. It's all done with mirrors. Young man, there are many sides to my nature. Depths you'd never dream of. - I'll make a study. - Do. - How'd you like a swim in the moonlight? - Swim? Later on. You do swim? Yes. Almost as well as I dance. Then you'll drown. - Isn't it awfully cold? - Extremely. Do you mind? What, me mind? My intimates call me "Polar Bear" Chandler. We're only 20 miles from the place. We'll be there in 45 minutes. But I'm not supposed to show up until midnight. What's the difference? You'll bust in on them a half an hour earlier, that's all. You'll find cigarettes over there under the lamp. Thanks. - Say, you're pretty palatial up here. - Like it? - I think it's grand. - I always come down for a plunge. I've even stayed here all night. No, thanks. - What? Here, alone? - Yes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Pretty neat. I like music with my moonlight. You know, you're a funny kid. That's what you seem like up here, a kid. Very different from the girl I met on the boat. I feel different. This place, it's all tied up with my childhood. The trees, the air, the water. Even the frogs. I'm mad about frogs. I love it. We've always had heavenly times up here. Every minute completely filled, like today. - Yes. It's been perfect. - It has, hasn't it? Almost too perfect. And it's costing me a fortune, young man. What? I'm paying dearly for this day of fun. Meaning? It's my own fault for daring to bet with Dad on men. I'm a rotten judge of men. Well, aren't we all? I bet him a new plane that you'd tip your hand in the first 24 hours. It's rather sporting of your father to back a dark horse. Dad's a grand judge of character. He placed you right away. Impetuous, friendly, enthusiastic, guileless. Guileless? Not so sure about that. What's your analysis? Well, I said it first on the boat. Just another fortune hunter chasing $50 million on the hoof. Then? And then you told me off for being fragile. but I still said, he's got something up his sleeve he wants to sell. An oil well, an invention, or an emerald mine. The last young man we took on had an emerald mine. And will you believe it, I even bet you didn't fish? And you lost. "Live and learn, Connie, my angel," I said. "Next time, don't bet on men." What are you thinking? I haven't hurt you, have I? I didn't mean to hurt you. It was just my way of saying I hope we can be friends. That's about the nicest thing that's been said to me this lifetime. - Friends? - Yes, please. Then you do forgive me? Don't apologize for suspecting people, Connie. Keep right on. Ring every coin you meet. There are lots of wooden nickels in circulation. Come on. No, I want to talk. You're the first person in years. You're in for it, my lad. The story of my life. The kitten who died when I was six, and my great-aunt Matilde. and all those twisted newspaper stories you read about my romances. and why they weren't romances. There aren't going to be any more twisted stories. What do you think a paper could make of this? And couldn't they just? You, me, here alone on a raft? <i>Single note of the chime</i> <i>indicates exactly 11:00.</i> 11:00. Lights out. And who are you, Cinderella's brother? - What happens at the stroke of 12:00? - You'll never know. I hope. - Come on, I'll race you. - All right. Connie Allenbury, you've taken from me the one thing in the world I love. my husband. - How is that? - Great. - Next week, <i>East Lynne.</i> - You just don't appreciate art. - Look, what's that? - What? It's a holdup. - Chandler. - What the. Why, Bill. I had to stop you before you got to the lodge. - She's gone. - What? You mean we aren't gonna finish it tonight? She only came to put the place in order. - then she went right back to town. - Why didn't you call? They don't have telephones in trout streams. I'd better go. Somebody might see you here. Aren't you going with us? Move over. I can't disappear in the middle of the night. What a lady-killer you are. One look at you and the gal disappears. Say, don't worry. Rome wasn't built in a day. It didn't cost $5 million, either. We had a nice, long ride. What are you talking about? We can't miss. - The setup is perfect. - The setup is crazy. We haven't a chance. At the end of the 10th round, it's a draw. The girl was there in the mountains? - But only for one night. - One night is enough. You told your wife you'd been called to Washington, remember? Yes, like it was yesterday. Yeah, but you lied. You didn't go to Washington. You went to Allenbury Lodge for a rendezvous with Connie. Our private detective will swear he followed you. - But her father was there. - That was a blind. - She left the following morning. - Sure. A guilty conscience. - You're insane. - What a mind. Now I know where you get those stories about working nights. Then you come home, you're indifferent to your wife. You fight with her. It's as neat a case for alienation of affection. as I've ever seen, and we slap it on tomorrow! - No, we don't. - Why don't we? Because you can't get away with it. They'd throw that case out of any court in the world. You, too. Not if I wear blue. I'm awfully appealing in blue. A: I was Allenbury's guest, not Connie's. B: I was never alone with her. C. - I know the alphabet. - But you haven't got a leg to stand on. Take it easy, will you? I'm getting a real in with the family. and I'm developing an open-and-shut case. We're gonna file suit tomorrow. Be at Britton & Britton's office at 9:00, and I can catch that noon edition. You'd make your crippled grandmother do a fan dance for that paper. Now, Gladdie. Wait a minute. Give me one week and I guarantee to put her in a real spot. Not a chance. She's walked out on you twice already. You know, Bill, I'm beginning to think you've lost your touch. - Goodbye, Gladdie. Don't be late. - Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? Well. That's Warren for you. Crazy about me, but boy, how he conceals it. - What's the matter with you? - I just can't make him out. I can understand he's tossing me to the dogs for the paper. - But to do it to the girl he loves. - Who's tossing whom to what dogs? If he goes through with this in the morning. by tomorrow night, we'll all be in jail. - Jail? - Jail. I don't get you. It's the plan we've had right along. Yeah, but we haven't enough evidence to convince a backward child. If we spring this, the Allenburys are bound to smell a frame-up! - Do you really think so? - I'm sure of it. But to think that he'd do this to you. A beautiful girl who loves him, who's doing everything in the world. Believe me, kid. You've put up with a lot. You know, you're one girl in a million. You don't know the tenth of it. You wouldn't believe what I've stood for. I know. The night I met him, he stood me up for two hours. For what? A woman in Jersey had quadruplets. and it's been that way ever since. I know. It's tough. Fine, sensitive girl like you. That's love for you. - The things I could tell you. - I'd like to hear all about them. - Let's have a bite to eat. - All right. - You dance divinely. - Thanks. There have been complaints. Then you must have been out with amateurs. I hope Warren won't mind our dancing like this. What? Him. After all, it's perfectly innocent. Just fun. Sure. Certainly a girl can dance with her own husband. - and you are my husband. - Yes, quite. Besides, this is our last night. What do you mean? If you're going to file suit tomorrow. I'll have to move out of here to prove that we're alienated. - You know, I'm gonna miss you. - I'll miss you, too. - You're a swell kid, Gladys. - You're not such a cluck yourself. I hate to see you get mixed up in that mess tomorrow. Look, you don't want me to file that suit, do you? No, I don't. For your own sake. Then I don't. I don't start anything until you tell me to. It'll mean a row with Warren. It won't be the first one. Let's dance some more. It's pretty late. 2:00. I could dance all night with my Billikins. My little fuzzy-wuzzy's got to get some sleep though. You're kind of cute when you say that. So I'm going to say good night, Mrs. Chandler. - I'm off to get some air. - Air? Yes, I haven't been able to sleep for the last two or three nights. Must be insomnia. I can fix that. My father used to have it. When he did, I'd rub his head with cologne, like that. I'll go get the cologne. It isn't that kind of insomnia. You know, different people respond to different things. Some people respond to rub-a-dub on the forehead. Others drop off to music. Now, me. - I'm a horse's hoof man. - A what? A horse's hoof man. That's what it takes to put me to sleep. The sound of a horse's hoof. Hoof, hoof. You know? Hoof, hoof. Good? Are you amenable to reason? Then you will come to my charity bazaar. No. You turned me down for the horse show. But I ride with you every morning. You scorned my bid to a concert. But I strum my guitar 'neath thy window each eve. And now you refuse my invitation for tomorrow night. But I'm dining with you and Father this evening. It's your last meal, my lad. I'm beginning to tumble. I do very well for the back streets. but you're ashamed to be seen with me in public. Certainly. A gal who smears mustard all over her chin. Thanks. - Beautiful now? - No, just clean. Stop turning my head. Now, for the purpose of the record, what time will you arrive at the bazaar? Once and for all, I am not attending the bazaar. Bill, what is it? What is it? It is a horse. Let's stop clowning. There's something wrong. - Tell me. What is it? - I can't. Why? Please. I swore I'd never mention it again. The libel suit? What's that got to do with your coming to my party? Plenty. Connie, drop the suit, will you? I know you feel that the paper hit you deliberately. Of course it was deliberate, to hurt my father. - So you're striking back. - And you think I'm heartless. No, just foolish. You think you're gonna end all publicity. but instead, you'll be smeared over every paper in the country. And I don't care, because. Let's not go all over it again. You asked for it. That's why I won't be seen with you in public. All you need now is one more good scandal. Why is there any scandal in my being seen with you? Because you're in the public eye more than ever. If the gossip columns link your name with a man's now. don't you see that it's going to make you light, cheap? You're taking this much too seriously, darling. - After all, it's my fight. - And that makes it mine. You're sweet. If I had $5 million, I'd give it to settle this thing. Shall I drop it, Bill? - Will you? - I'll tell you tomorrow at the party. Now you'll have to come. How about the Athletic Club? Try the Yale. Try it again! I've got to get him! Two hours late. This guy is driving me mad. He hasn't seen her in 10 days. I can't make it out. It's not the old Chandler. Hello? Try his apartment. No use. Mrs. Chandler was calling from there. She's looking for him, too. - Didn't you tell her I was here? - She wanted him. She's afraid he's offended at something she said this morning. She wanted to apologize. Gladys wanted to apologize? He was to meet her at lunch and didn't come. She wanted us to try the morgue in case of an accident. She never tried the morgue for me. - Say, what's going on here? - Maybe he's working on the wrong girl. Working on the. What are you talking about? After all, she's his wife. She may be his wife, but she's engaged to me! The boss wants to see you right away, Mr. Haggerty. Yeah. All right. His wife. What about this fellow Chandler? I thought he was supposed to be clever. He's clever, all right. A lot cleverer than I thought he was. What are you talking about? He hasn't seen this Allenbury girl in 10 days. Do you call that being clever? Great scott, man. Do you realize what this means? More than you know. It's your business to find out what he's been doing. That's just exactly it. I'm going to take the matter into my own hands. I'm going to see Connie Allenbury personally. Why do you think she will see you? Mr. Bane, when I was a reporter, I'd get into places. that even a second-story man couldn't break into. All right, try it. Make her see. Appeal to her reason. She has none. This is Connie Allenbury, international playgirl. the spoiled daughter without a brain in her head! But I know how to handle her kind. I'm gonna throw myself on her mercy and appeal to her heart. I'm going to give her all the sob stuff! You know, Miss Allenbury, this situation has outgrown a petty fight. We've got to consider the humanitarian aspect. I must appeal to your social conscience. Thanks. I didn't know your paper thought I had one. Now, now. If you go through with this case. it's going to throw 500 people out of employment. Men and women, jobless, walking the streets. women like yourself, tired, cold, and hungry. - Driven to drink and ruin. - You write the editorials, don't you? Yes. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're saying to yourself, it's not my fault if people starve. - It's the fault of the paper. - Isn't it? No, it's my fault, it's my mistake. And all my life I shall be faced with the knowledge. that I have wrecked the lives of 500 people. That's all I care about, Miss Allenbury. Those poor, unfortunate souls. After all, they shouldn't suffer for. You're right, they shouldn't suffer for your mistakes. Miss Allenbury. Thank you. I knew you'd feel this way. - They must be taken care of. - Heaven bless you, Connie. Miss Allenbury. And you, too, for calling it to my attention. I shall see to it personally. that the whole $5 million goes into a trust fund for them. You mean you're gonna go ahead with the case? I must, to get the $5 million. Now I shall push it doubly hard. Now I have a cause. But the paper will go under. It will fold. Yes, I know, but you said that was secondary. The main thing is to take care of these poor men and women. Yes, I know, but there are other considerations. Is there anything in this house for a hungry man? - Yoo-hoo. - Hello, my sweet. Excuse me. - Hello, darling. - Hello. Dear, Mr. Haggerty of the <i>New York Star.</i> Mr. Chandler. Well, not William Chandler, the writer? Yes, I'm William Chandler. He writes travel books. That takes you to a lot of interesting places, doesn't it? Yes. Of course, it's all in the day's work. I'm just becoming familiar with your work. Yes? I thought perhaps you might do something for our paper. It'd be a little change from what you're doing now. I'm afraid that I'm pretty full up. - Up to your neck, I suppose. - I object. No more work. - Do sit down, Mr. Haggerty. - Thank you. I only see him now once a day. Connie, you mustn't exaggerate. If we must be factual, twice a day sometimes, maybe three. You'll give Mr. Haggerty the wrong impression. After all, he's a newspaperman. - Don't worry about impressing me. - And besides, he's not a columnist. He didn't come to discuss gossip. He came to discuss the case. Yes, the case. By all means. - Yeah, that's right. - And it's all settled. You mean you're dropping the suit? No, but thanks to Mr. Haggerty's social conscience. all of the employees will be taken care of. with the $5 million I shall win from the <i>Star.</i> That was all he cared about, wasn't it, Mr. Haggerty? Absolutely all. And now that you've been so generous. I think I'll say thank you and run along. Please don't hurry. You spoke of other considerations. They really don't matter at all. Just so long as those poor men and women don't starve. You've taken a great load off my mind. - Have I? - Yes, indeed. I don't think there's another thing to discuss. There certainly is not. I'm Warren Haggerty, the managing editor of the <i>New York Evening Star.</i> I know. The butler told me you were here. - He'll show you to your car. - Then I won't keep him waiting. And you can tell your owner, Mr. Hollis Bane. we're not entertaining anyone from his yellow rag in this house. I'll make it a point to tell him. You're entertaining no representatives of the <i>Evening Star.</i> Thank you. Good night. Miss Allenbury, good night. It's a surprise, Mr. Chandler, but a great pleasure seeing you here. Hello? Hello, Gladys? Yes. What? You just saw him there a minute ago? He's been seeing her every day? Sure. He's been protecting her. He's in love with her. That's why he's stalling us. But we got him now, and the case, too. How long will it take you to get to the Allenburys'? A half hour? Perfect. Sure, he'll be there. He can't get away. He was just going in to dinner when I left. Thattagirl. Tear the roof off. And get in touch with me at the office. as soon as you've done your stuff. Right. Bye-bye. By this time tomorrow, I'll be dining on shipboard. - What? Where do you think you're going? - I'm having dinner with my publisher. He's sailing on the <i>Victoria</i> tomorrow, the 8th. Today is the 8th. No, tomorrow is the 8th. Friday the 8th. No, Bill. Today is Friday. Today? - What? - Of course. Friday the 8h. This is terrible. He has a contract waiting for me to sign. I've got to see him. What time does the ship sail? - 11:00, from Brooklyn. - You can make it. - I'll drive you in. - No, you finish your dinner. I have my own car here. I'm so sorry. This is terrible. Mr. Chandler's apartment, please. And would you rush it? Yes? Don't you "Hello, Gladdie" me, Bill Chandler. So you were having dinner with your publisher. You've been handing me a line of pretty talk for the past 10 days. and all the time you've been seeing Connie Allenbury. You can't do that to me. Don't forget you're my husband. and I'm telling that to Miss Allenbury tonight. Now, Gladys, that doesn't sound like you. I don't blame you for being upset, but I can explain everything. Will you meet me at the Paradise Roof in 20 minutes? All right, I'll meet you. But nothing you can say will stop me. from telling that Allenbury gal tonight. Remember that. Here's the headline proof on the Allenbury yarn. Swell, elegant, magnificent. We'll write in the gory details when we hear from Gladys. What's keeping her? It's after 12:00. The old man's probably trying to bribe her. Say, that'll make a swell subhead. "Rich father tries to bribe wronged wife." I wonder where that skunk Chandler is now. He probably ducked to China or Africa or something. Hello, Warren. - Where have you been? - Dancing. - What did you say? - Dancing. You know. You mean you didn't go to the Allenburys'? You didn't. - No, we decided against it. - Why you. Self-control, Warren. Very important for a man your age. Here. Throw this out. Go on. Now what have you got to say for yourselves? - Don't shout, Warren. We're not used to it. - Are you going to tell me what happened? You'd better tell him, Bill. His blood pressure. Yes. Perhaps you're right. Warren, what would you say if I told you. that I had almost persuaded Miss Allenbury to drop the case? I'd say you were a dirty, double-dealing liar, and I'd be right. I won't stand here and listen to you being insulted. Come on, Bill. Is that so? Wait. Listen to this. Not four hours ago, I heard your two-timing Romeo. whispering sweet nothings into the ears of Connie Allenbury. What do you think of that? Bill told me all about it. That's technique, Warren. You wouldn't understand it. Why didn't you tell me you were seeing Connie Allenbury? Sure, and have you spoil all my good work. as you did tonight, barging in. just as I'd about convinced her to drop the case. We didn't need any charity from her. All Gladys had to do was bust into the house. As Bill says, and have you smear our names all over your paper. you headline hunter. Believe me, this way is better and cleaner. Tomorrow evening, the Allenburys are giving a party. I'll be there. Go right ahead, Bill. I trust you. And what's more, I'll get her to drop this case, once and for all. That is, unless you decide to barge in again. You're so obvious, Warren. Why can't you be subtle, like Bill? Are you gonna listen to him or me? I'm going to listen to Bill. He knows best. How do I know that you can get Connie to drop the case? You'll have to take my word for that. That's good enough for me. Maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best way. Now you're talking sense. All right, go ahead. I'm sorry I blew up, old man. Think nothing of it. Now you see how silly it was to get excited, Warren. After all, I do want you boys to be good friends. - Come on, Bill. Good night, Warren. - Good night. - Good night, old man. - Good night. What's up? That low-down, conniving rat. making Gladys believe he's in love with her. - He won't get away with it. - Can you stop him? I'm going to wash up the Allenbury case and Mr. Chandler with it. Gladys may be eating out of his hand now, but before I get through, she'll be biting it. Here, son. Tell Douglas to print up one copy of the evening edition. Put that item at the head of the society column. - One copy? - That's what I said. Our circulation is certainly falling off. I'll be right back. Gladdie! What are you doing here? Can't a girl have any privacy? I had to see you. I got great news. It better be good, bursting in on me like this. It's about Bill. Say, I certainly had that guy all wrong. He's a wonder. Congratulations. When did you come out of the ether? I was a sap to ever doubt him. He just called me a minute ago. Told me he's getting Connie to drop the suit tonight. Then off he goes on an around-the-world cruise. ending up at the altar. spliced to an eight-figure fortune. What a man. What are you talking about? You know he's got those Allenburys right in the palm of his hand. "It seems the charity bazaar at the Allenbury house tonight. "is something in the way of a farewell party. "J. B. Allenbury and his attractive daughter, Connie, are sailing. "for a four-months, around-the-world cruise on the <i>S.S. San Ramone.</i> "Accompanying them on this cruise will be Connie's current favorite. "William Chandler. "Do we hear wedding bells?" - How do you like that? - Let me see that paper. I have to run. Just thought you'd like to hear the good news. Somebody get me out of here! Get me out of here! Have a photographer at Allenbury's home at 9:00. - There's gonna be fireworks there tonight. - Right. Step this way for the great game of skill. Darto. Throw a dart and win a beautiful prize. $1 a dart, and cheap at half the price. Woo lady luck at the wheel of chance. Pick the winning number and win a priceless prize for the lady. Come one, come all. Look, ring the neck of a bottle and win a baby doll. No trick, no deception. Pure, unadulterated skill. Yes, sir. How many? Where's Connie? I must see Connie. I'm so anxious to tell her about Mr. Chandler's wife. - Mr. Chandler's wife? - Yes. You know Chandler, the fish man on the boat? We met his wife. A most amazing creature. But nonsense. He's not married. We never dreamed he was married. He didn't look married and he certainly didn't act married. The married ones never do. I'm sure there's a mistake. No, there isn't. We saw him this afternoon coming out of the hotel. We called him, both of us, but he was getting into a taxi. Let's have a drink. I had to run half a block, trying to make him see me. But he'd gone. So we went into the hotel to leave a message. The clerk asked if we wished to speak to his wife. I said, "Naturally." He said that she was in the beauty shop. We saw her. My dear, she's a case. A psychopathic case. She was in a booth, and she kept screaming, "Let me out of here!" Before we could speak to her, she rushed past us. Look, there's Connie and Mr. Chandler now. All ready. Hold still, please. Why, grandma, what big muscles you've got. The better to sock you with, grandpa. Hold still. You wait here. I'll get them. We'll make a party of it. Waitress. Mary, champagne cocktails for five, please. I'll be right back. Queen of the air. Now, now. One at a time, please. Connie, I must see you. What is it, dear? I can't talk to you here. - But Bill. - He'll keep. Thank you. Connie? I've been robbed. Driver, can't you go any faster? I can, lady, but the cab can't. Now, what is it? I haven't seen you this worried since I stole your favorite fishing rod. Connie, how much does Chandler mean to you? - Not jealous, are you? - Are you in love with him? Terribly. More than I ever dreamed I could care for anyone. You're sure? I'm sure. Why? You like him, don't you? Of course. Then what are you being so mysterious about? What is it, Dad? The Burns-Norvells say he's married. I don't believe it. You know the Burns-Norvells. I'm afraid it's true, Connie. They've even met the woman. No. I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please. And yet it explains so much. Why we've always had to meet alone. It's hideous suspecting him. - and yet. - We've got to know. - Roberts? - Yes, sir. - Ask Mr. Chandler to come here, please. - Very good, sir. - But let me ask him, Dad. - No, Connie. Please. It's my problem. Let me handle it my own way. You're sure you don't want me to. You'll ask him point-blank so that he can't misunderstand? Yes. I'll ask him so he can't misunderstand. Go on, darling. I'm all right. And so the flying princess, tired of this Earth. flew back to her home, the moon. - There isn't any princess. - No? There isn't any moon. Just Connie. That's all right with me. Say, I'm glad you ducked out. It's much nicer here. Bill, there's something I've got to ask you. Animal, vegetable, or mineral? It's just. I don't know where to begin. What is it, darling? We've had such fun together, such happy times. But, Connie, darling, what's the matter? What's happened? There's a question. Well? It's the most important question I'll ever ask. Just answer yes or no, but don't explain. If it's no, don't explain. Well, go ahead. Wait till I catch my breath. Bill, have you been proposed to much? Have I been what? You know, proposed to? Your hand in marriage. Well, not enough to turn my head. - Why? - I'm asking you to marry me. What? - Is that the question? - Yes. Will you marry me? Well, Connie. Will you? What do you think? - When? - When? Now? Now? You mean soon? I mean now, tonight. Tonight? - Will you, Bill? - Will I? Is there a preacher in the house? - Not here. We'll take the car. We'll drive. - To the moon. - Awfully glad you've enjoyed it. - Thanks to you. - Pardon me, Mr. Allenbury. - What is it, Roberts? There's a person here who claims to be Mrs. William Chandler. She wants to see Mr. Chandler immediately. Where is she? I took the liberty of asking her to wait on the terrace, sir. Thank you, Roberts. I'll see her. Good evening. I'm Mr. Allenbury. Yes? I'm Mrs. William Chandler, and I can prove it, too. - You'll have every opportunity to do so. - I'll say I will. I want my husband. Where is he? Your husband will be returned to you intact, Mrs. Chandler. Just as soon as I can find him. - I'll go with you. - No. I think it would be wiser if you stayed here. - So, you're afraid I'll make a scene. - On the contrary, I'm looking forward to it. I'll bring your husband to you directly. - Follow that roadster. - I got it. Perfect. Don't lose them, and try to get pictures. - Right. I won't lose them. - I'll be getting the special edition ready. William Stevens Chandler. Ever been married before? Not to speak of. My wife will be the witness. She'll be down in a minute. Here she is now. - Are they sober? - I think so. This is love, not liquor. Join hands, please. William, do you take Constance to be your lawful wife. to have and to hold, in sickness and in health. to love, honor, and cherish. - Did you get Gladys on the phone? - Sure. What did you say? That I was looking for you with some important information. - And? - She fell like a log. She asked me what information I had, so I dropped the bomb. I told her I was driving by the Grand Plaza and saw Connie and Bill go in. On investigating, I found they'd been assigned to suite 805 and 807. as man and wife. - What did she say? - What didn't she say? You know, I've been thinking. that was a justice of the peace they called on. - Maybe he really did marry her. - How could he? He's got a wife already. - I know, but. - There's Gladys now. Okay, buddy. We're off to the races. You wait here. So? - Gladys, this is a surprise. - I'll bet it is. I'm sorry to break into your little party, Miss Connie Allenbury. but this man happens to be my husband. This is the lady I told you about, a Miss Gladys Benton. - "Mrs. William Chandler" is the name. - Yes. How do you do? - I said, "Mrs. William Chandler." - I've been looking forward to meeting you. - Bill's told me so much about you. - He told you about me? Yes. Won't you sit down? No, you don't. You're not getting out of here! I'm not leaving. I just don't want Warren to miss anything. - Hello. - Hello. Could you hear all right, or shall we start over? Hello, Mr. Haggerty. Do come in. So nice to see you. Let's all sit down. Yes, let's. What are you doing here? - Naturally, she didn't expect you. - I didn't know he was out there. This has nothing to do with you or your newspaper, so you keep out of it. As Mrs. William Chandler, I demand. There must be some mistake. You see, this is Mrs. Chandler. - What? - What? Yes. And has been for a whole hour. - Yes, we were just married. - Have you gone crazy? If you think you can excuse this by pulling a marriage gag. But we are married. Really. Yes. I always carry our marriage certificate right with me. - They're married, all right. - But that's arson. You mean it's bigamy! What a story. Connie Allenbury marries bigamist. Print that in the paper, you'll have another libel suit on your hands. - I'm not a bigamist. - You married me, didn't you? - That one doesn't count. - What are you talking about? About a certain Mr. Joseph Simpson, your lawfully wedded husband. What are you trying to hand me? I've been divorced. You got your divorce in Yucatán, by mail. Three years ago, all Yucatán divorces were declared illegal. I found that out yesterday in the Hall of Records. I also consulted my attorney. Then you and Gladys were never really married? - That's right. - But I made an honest man of him. Dear, don't forget the letter. Yes. This is from Mrs. Chandler, for you. Warren, she was so touched by your pity. - for your 500 starving employees. - You've dropped the suit! - But l. - Connie. Miss Allen. Mrs. Chandler. How can I ever. I just can't thank you enough. Connie Allenbury marries author. What a story! What a scoop! Mr. Haggerty, you've forgotten something. - Yes. My hat. Excuse me. - Your hat and Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Simpson? Gladdie, of course. That "Mrs. Simpson" gets me, Gladdie. I've got to run along to the office. You phone me there in the morning. Just a minute. You want a real scoop? I'll give you one! I found out my Yucatán divorce was no good. so I got a second divorce from Joe Simpson in Reno. - What? - What? - Then, we're not. - I don't believe it. Then try the Reno Hall of Records. - But. - That's quite right. Now where do we all stand? Let's all sit down and talk things over quietly. You and I will have plenty of time to talk this over on our world cruise. I'm sure Miss Allenbury won't mind turning her ticket over to me now. Ticket? World cruise? What are you talking about? You're getting all excited. Now come along. What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing. I had to use it as a little gag. So it's just one of your little gags to get me here! I'm here, all right. Before I'm through, you'll all be sorry you ever saw me. You were all terribly smart, weren't you? You were all building up to a nice happy ending. Haggerty wins his case. Chandler wins his girl. Where do I stand? I'll tell you where, right behind the eight ball. You thought it was a lot of fun, didn't you, making me fall for you? Well, I did fall. But I'm picking myself up, William Chandler. You can't fool me any more with your hoof, hoof, hoof. or your insomnia or your publisher. You're a pretty poor sample of a husband. But nobody else is gonna get you, not if it kills both of us. - Now look, Gladys. - You're 10 times worse than he is! At least he had some excuse for kicking me around. He was in love with another woman. But you double-crossed me for the sake of a newspaper! Marry the paper and be the proud father of a lot of headlines! That's all you're good for anyway. I suppose this is all very distasteful to you, Miss Allenbury. You're not accustomed to hearing the truth. You've had money to protect you from it all your life! You spent your entire life buying anything you want. My husband isn't for sale. You can't buy him at any price! - Will you let me go? - You can't walk out on me like this! Gladdie! Wait a minute. Wait. Let me handle this. You two diplomats have done enough. - I'm afraid it's locked. - Then please give me the key. - Not yet. I want to talk to you. - I've talked enough. Right. Now it's my turn. - You can't offer me money. - I wouldn't think of it. Pleading won't do you any good. - I'm sure. - What else is there to talk about? - You. - Me? I've a pretty fair notion of what you've been through. - What do you mean by that? - Any woman can be starved by neglect. The little attentions Bill paid you seemed so much greater. because you weren't getting them from Haggerty. The only time he sent me flowers, he signed it "Bill." Exactly. He probably never noticed the clothes you wore. never told you how lovely you looked, the way Bill did. That's right. How did you know? Women can't fool women about men. - You don't want Bill. - Oh, no? I know you've got him now, in name anyway. But I have his love. You can't build a life on hate, or a marriage on spite. Marriage is too important. - Mine only lasted an hour, but I know. - I'm not gonna listen to you! A fine mess you made of this, and all because you tried to steal Gladys! I wouldn't steal Gladys if she were the last female on earth. Female? That does it! You can't stand there and insult Gladdie. You've had this coming for a long time. Yes, and I've been looking forward to it! - We'll settle it right now! - With interest. I don't love Warren Haggerty. I'll never love him! I never want to see him. I never want to hear his name! I hate him! - They're fighting! - Warren! Wait a minute! Don't be a sucker. You hear who she is calling? Now, are you satisfied? Say, I got an idea. She'll feel sorrier for you if I punch you in the nose. Warren, darling! Why, Bill! I treated you terribly and now you are hurt. It's my fault, darling. I'm just a mug, Gladdie, but I love you. Let me see. You're bleeding! You big coward, you must have hit him when his back was turned. How dare you? Are you all right? What is this? What's going on here? Hello, Father. I got your telephone call. What's this? Now be calm, please. - I can explain everything. - You'd better explain fast! - You mean to tell me you married him? - Yes, Father. - Who is this woman? - That's Bill's wife. What? Quiet, will you please be quiet! English The Unbelievable Truth Excuse me , but . Are you a priest No. I'm a mechanic Where're you headed ? Home. Where're you coming from ? Prison. - Where're you headed ? - Long Island. I ain't going that far. New York Get in.make quick though I'm beat You wanna drive? I don't drive. What do you mean you don't drive ? I don't have a license. Were you a priest or something? I'm a mechanic. Yeah , that's what I thought. So how 'bout it? How 'bout what? Do you wanna drive ? I don't drive. I don't drink. - Where were you last night? - Out. - Where! - Walking. Audrey , The high school called again yesterday. Oh , yeah. I forgot to go to school yesterday. Sorry. Honey , you haven't gone to school all week. How do you forget to go to school! Pass the sugar, please. If you keep this up you won't get accepted by any college in the country I don't want to go to college anyway. Don't start, Audry! But, Audry, I thought you wanted to be a journalist; A TV anchor woman like that lady on the six o'clock news? Why are you two so concerned about my college education? The world is gonna blow up anyday now anyway. It's hopeless. Give my college money to the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament Bunch of goddamn anarchists filling your head with left-wing nonsense! Ofcourse you are gonna go to college.You're gonna go if I gotta drag you there myself! A person hasn't gotta chance in the world without a college education! I got accepted. That's great honey! Congratulations! Here, look, Vic! Harvard! - It's a college. - It's expensive ! You can't put a price tag on a thing like that, Vic. You can put a price tag on anything, Liz! Didn't you apply anywhere else? No I'm gonna be paying for this the rest of my life. Victor, aren't you proud of her? I'm not going anyway. We'll all be lucky if we're alive in September. Shut up, of course you are going to college It says right here in the paper that the present work force between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five is the most highly educated and highest paid in American history. That's what you have to contend with. But, Dad, history is coming to an end. - What's she talking about? - The End of the world. By the way, Vic, the washing machine is busted. Audry, the world's not gonna come to an end When there are so many people making so much money. - What's this about the washing machine? - It's busted. We just bought the damn thing. What's wrong with it? It just shoots water all over the place. Mom, You got any valium? Hold it a minute! I wanna talk about this Harvard thing. - Dad, I'm going to be late for school. - Bullshit! Vic! I hope you're saving the money you making at Burger World. I quit. But, Honey, didn't you like working at Burger World? Let us consider some of the possible ways a person might die in a nuclear attack He might be incinerated instantly by the fireball or the thermal pulse He might be crushed to death by the blast wave. He might receive lethal radiation poisoning from the local fall-out He might die of starvation because the economy had collapsed and no food was being grown He might die of cold, for lack of heat or clothing , or of exposure, for lack of shelter He might be killed by people seeking food or shelter which he had obtained. He might be killed by exposure to the sun, because the damaged ozone layer was no longer filtering out ultra-violet rays. What's with the suit, Emmet? - I just got it. You like it? - I think it's gross. I like it. I told my parents I quit my job at Burger World. You know, things are really looking up for me, Audry. The school psychologist says I'm apathetic. The whole world out there in front of me and I'm ready for it. I told him about the holes in the ozone layer and he said he didn't believe me. A guy like me can go far and that's exactly what I plan to do. Thousands of people across eastern Europe still experiencing lung complications because of Chernobyl and he's telling me how these should be the happiest years of my life. I'm going to take this world in my teeth, chew it up, and spit it back out again. Emmet, we're on the brink of global extinction. The wheels of fortune are rolling in my direction. Every night I go to bed dreaming about suicide. Then I feel ashamed and cry myself to sleep. And my friends all like you a lot. and my parents do too. Emmet, you're not even listening to me. Oh, I am so And I'll tell you quite frankly, Audry, I'm worried About what? - About you. - Why? Well, because lately you seem so. you know, apathetic. Emmet, you're a dick. Oh, come on, Audry, don't be sore! I mean it. I'm worried. You don't even listen to me when I'm talking! I do so! And you've been talking like a Crazy person lately. Everybody says so. And Audry, look what you're wearing! - Look what you're wearing! - Hey! This costs a 185$ ! Congratulations! Listen, Audry, I know you've been a little mixed up lately. I'm not mixed up. I'm depressed. Whatever. What ?! Listen. I don't hear anything. Bombs Listen Audrey what I'm trying to tell you is that I don't wanna lose you. You've never had me, you idiot. What do you mean ? I don't know. Emmet I don't want to go out with you any more. You disgust me ! You mean. You mean you . I don't want you. But Audrey . Sorry. MEANWHILE How are you, Pearl? Excuse me for seeming so forward but, you know, you're really quite attractive. No really, I mean it You see, I'm a photographer. Have you ever thought getting into modeling?

Ever I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was so serious. - Get in the goddamn car. - No ! - Emmet, you're over-reacting - What's the point! What's a man without the woman he loves! He's nothing! A hollow shell! Oh, fuck, Emmet. She's in love with somebody else! Come on, ease up. She's going through a phase. She's a girl, Emmet. You know how girls are. She's sleeping with some guy who's gotta bigger cock, I know it. That's my fucking daughter you're talking about, asshole! But she's a girl! You said so yourself! There's a difference between a girl and a slut! All girls are sluts! - Have you and Audry been having sex? - Of course we have! You bastard. I trusted you! Get real, Mr Hugo!

I happen to be a big fan of George Washington myself. - Really ? - He represents a lot of things I admire For Instance He's singular. One. One dollar bill And just look at the guy; he's not very attractive But he's got dignity. And he was a farmer I can't help thinking that he were alive today, doing the job he did then, leading that particular revolution, he'd be locked up Or worse. All of them Franklin. Payne, Jefferson.They'd be executed. Well, maybe not executed. Don't put it past people. I don't trust anyone. So, What do you do? I'm a mechanic. - You work around here? - I don't work anywhere, just yet - Do you need a job? - Yeah Go to this place. - Hi Vic. - What's that still doing here? Man, Vic, this car is really twisted.

Upstate New York where? - Ossining. - Where in Ossining? In prison. I fixed cars in prison - So what do you think? - It's him. I'm sure it's him It's been a long time. I wasn't so sure before, but now I'm positive We gotta fucking mass murderer in the garage. - He's not a mass murderer! - That's what I heard! Mike, you're so fucking simple! Look , I heard That him and the girl shot her parents Then went on the road and then he shot her too. If he killed all those people he'd be in prison for life! Well, that's what I heard. Don't Pearl know what happened? Pearl doesn't talk about it. Well, What happened, as far as I know,he killed the father Because Something like the girl wanted him to. And then she flipped out and killed herself. What about the mother? I never heard anything about the mother. What's he doing now? He's fixing the goddamn Mercedes, you knucklehead!Why aren't you helping him? He just needed me for the beginning part. You should see 'im work, Vic. Fucking amazing. Knows exactly what he's doing. Doesn't hardly make a sound. - Yeah ? - Yeah. - He's good? - Oh, So good. Come on. Thanks. So what brings you back to town, Josh? It's the only place I know. outside of prison. Are your family's all gone? ain't they? The house is still there How long have you been out? Two days. What are you going to do now? I'm gonna find myself a job. Hold on. - Look, I can't pay you much. -I don't need much. Yeah, well . I can start right away. There's some coveralls back there in the office. What's this? What kinda question is that? Just asking. It's Fish. Really ? - Look, you said the special, right. - OK! OK! It's fine. Listen .. guys probably say this to you all the time But you ever been a model? What? I can swear I saw you in a magazine or an ad or something. What are you tryin' to pull? You don't have money to pay for this?Do ya? Of course I do! I'm a professional photographer.Here's my camera. You're a photographer , huh? Eddie!We have some kinda troublemaker up here! No! No! Look! I'll pay.I'll pay So are you sure it's him? It's him. Josh Hutton. Came back to town. Ain't you scared to be working with 'im? Sometimes he gets this real strange glint in his eye.. Like he's remembering something really horrible - Oh man, I'd be terrified - What did he do? He raped and killed Pearl older sister and then shot her father and . We never found the mother. - He did not! - He did so! Him and Pearl's sister had a deal, She wanted to kill her father, but she couldn't do it herself So she got Josh to do it. - Why did she want to kill her father? - I don't know. There was probably some sick, incestuous relationship going on and It was driving her crazy. Oh, gross! Maybe, because she killed herself afterward The girl killed herself first. How do you know about it? She killed herself because her old man wouldn't let her marry Josh Hutton Josh then went out after the old man and shoots him. Then he goes back and kill his own goddamn father! Bullshit! That don't sound right at all. - Hey! Watch your mouth, kid! - I'm not a kid - Oh no, prove it! Nice Josh shot his own father too? Well, doesn't Pearl know anything about this? Pearl don't talk about it. And I'm warning you right now kid, don't even ask her. Don't call me kid! You know, that's why Pearl's the way she is. She was just a little kid It's Messed her up good There's nothin' wrong with Pearl! You got it all fouled up! Mr Hugo is crazy hiring a guy like that. Why? He's a good mechanic. He was so nice to Pearl though. Carried her right in off the highway. I don't believe the criminal element can ever be completely rehabilitated. Really, If you hurry, I think you can catch Romper Room. The life of George Washington. Father of our country. Thanks - What's this one? - The Misanthrope. Molière. It's a play. - What's a misanthrope? - Somebody who doesn't like people. I star in it. I mean, in class. We read it in class Are you the misanthrope? No. I wanted to be,But they wouldn't let me play a man.So,instead,I play flirt. Is it an interesting role? Being a flirt? Sometimes. But the thing about flirting is that it leads to harder things. Is that bad? No. It isn't bad. It turns out pretty badly for the woman I play. What happens? - She can't stop flirting. - Ever? It's just the way some people are. She flirts herself to death. It's a sad play. Well, she doesn't die actually. It's just that the only man who really loves her has impossible standards. That's too bad. Yeah, it is Does it have happy ending? Nobody gets what they want and they all go away frustrated and sad. A tragedy. Audrey! What are you doing here? What ? - You know what ! - What ? What the hell happened between you and Emmet! I'm driving to work this morning and I see the kid Standing in the middle of the road immobilized by grief Emmet wears boxer shorts with dollar signs all over them. I don't wanna hear about Emmet's goddamn underwear! What are you so dreamy about! The world's gonna end tomorrow, remember! Right now it's today. It's not tomorrow. Audrey, Did you go to school today? No. Listen , Audrey. I've been thinking about this Harvard thing. Let's . Let's make a Deal. A what ? A deal If I give $ 1,000 to this nuke-head commie charity organization of yours, will you forget about Harvard and go to the community college? Are you serious ? Yeah, I'm serious. I don't want to go to college. Any college. Will you just give it a try? - Would I have to study communications? - What else would you study? Literature Literature! What the hell are you gonna do with literature? Read ! I don't know. Would this be a yearly arrangement? Or would I be obligated to a full four years in return for the one donation? - That would depend. - On what ? On how well you do the first year. A thousand a year if I pass all my classes. If your grade-point average is high. - Medium. - High Only for literature. I won't do that for communications. No. Communications or nothing. OK, but I have the option to drop out after the first year. Only if your grade-point average is high. - You have to write the check today. - Five hundred now and the remainder at the end of the first semester. It's only fair, Audry. Normal business procedure. - Okay. - Then it's a deal? Yeah, sure Come to my father's birthday party tonight Assets. Any kind of assets.You gotta have 'em. The whole fucking country's run on credit. I hate that. Yeah, But it works out for guys like you and me, though. I don't trust that speculation crap. I like to see money. I like to lay my hands on it. But you've gotta be leveraged. - What ? - Leveraged - You look wonderfull in that dress. - Really ? - Beautiful. - Great. So who are you waiting for? No one. Audry. Come over here a minute. Audry, I want you to meet Mr Todd Whitbred We know each other for years and years ago Todd here, he's a commercial photographer. So, Todd, tell audry what we were talking about. Listen to this, Audry. Well, like your father was saying Audry, I'm a commercial photographer. I do mostly do christenings and weddings, that kinda thing but I gotta couple a' spreads in couple of magazines Any way, like I was telling your father here you know . you really got a look. See, you have what they call poise A real presence Poise. That's what you have. Poise. And that's a valuable thing. Oh, everybody thinks so. And in my professional opinion, I think, you could, if you wanted to be a.a model Dad, what's he getting at? - He's talking about work, Audry. - There's a lotta money in modeling. Especially for a girl like you who's got great. poise. What Todd's trying to say Audry is that maybe you can be a model. But I'm going to college. Ofcourse you're goin' to college! But maybe you can make some money and help help pay for college. If I wasn't going to college, I'd be a carpenter. - Since when ? - Since Always Jesus was a carpenter. He was a radical. I like radicals. Audry, knock it off. Dad if I'm gonna have to help pay for college then I'm going to study literature. - That wasn't the deal. - Well, the deal's different now. - What 'bout the charity donation? - Still holds. You drive a hard bargain, Audry. You can make a lotta money fast if you make the right connections. There, Audry, see. Oh, yeah? How do you make these connections? - First you need a portfolio. - A what? Portfolio. It's French. It's a bunch of shots of Audry here With the different outfits, different make-up,different hairstyles - To show her off, as a model. - Where the hell am I get one of those? Well It's up to you but I give you a good deal on the shots myself And I can also introduce Audry around. Help her make some connections. How much? Well, it's hard to say right off the bat, but. $ 750? - What ? - $ 650! For photographs? It's a necessary and important investment in a modeling career. But I hardly know you! How'd you get in here? What are you doing here? I deserve some kind of an explanation I mean, really, after all we've been through What have we been through? Well, everything. It's another guy,right? Did you really have a fight with my father? It's Bill,isn't it? Emmet, please I knew it. - You said 550? - 650. I don't know. Look Mr Hugo you can make a lot of money of this girl She's a good-lookin' kid. Trust me You get her in this modeling thing and You'll make your money back in no time. 600 ornothing. It's a deal. It all just seems so empty to me. What does ? Everything does The house. These clothes. Party What was that? Excuse me? You said something! - Yeah, I said something, so What's it to you? Well I'm not so sure I like what you said. - You don't even know what I said! - Oh, yes I do. - I don't know. Does he? - Got me. - What did I say? - I don't care what you said! I think it's about time you guys left this party. - We just got here! - Look, pal, what's your problem? - Listen you wanna go outside? - No, I don't I think you and I better go outside and settle this thing. What thing? - Look, pal, you're buggin' me! - No, you're buggin' me! - Come on, let's get outta here - No way! We ain't done nothing! - You guys are making trouble, man! - I ain't starting anything! - You wanna go outside? - Yeah! You wanna go outside? Yeah, I wanna go outside Come on, out! Let's go outside and finish this thing once and for all! OK. Wait a minute Ready ? Go! Pearl Let's get out of here. Okay. - There. - What is it ? - Do you hear it? - Bombs? - Could be - Nearby? No. They wouldn't drop the bomb on the weekend, would they? Who knows ? Could be some freak accident happens and BOOM!!! History of human endeavor is flushed down the toilet. It makes you think. You know, Who would do something like that? Could be anybody. Everybody's got nuclear capability now. Even the Pakistanis they've got this bomb - a nuclear bomb - that fits inside a suitcase. I don't want to think about it. No. Let's not think about it right now. Let's just lie here. Pearl , Do you like older men? Occasionally. - I met a man yesterday. - An older man ? I think so. He looks older. he was older than me. What was he like? He had a history. You could tell just by looking at him. Be careful of men with histories. He was poor He was hungry He had no possessions. He had no place even to live And he was like entirely dressed in black. Who is it? His name is Joshua, Joshua Hutton. Pearl, what is it? I have to go now - Pearl? - No really I have to work later this afternoon and I really need to get some sleep. Bye. Fucking cowards Emmet! What happened ? Audrey, is that you? Knock it off! Tell me what happened? I kicked ass. But why ? Well because I love you, Audrey. That's too bad, Emmet. Mom, what do you know about Josh Hutton? Josh Hutton. What do you want to know about Josh Hutton? Dad just hired him. - Really ? - Yeah. What do you know about him? Well. He killed some people. Who did he kill? Pearl's sister. When was this ? This was a few years before he killed her father. I don't remember any of this. It was a long time ago. You were only two And Pearl never talks about it. He seems like a nice man. You think so? I mean, after he's killed your sister and your father. Things happen. People make mistakes I can see how your sister was a mistake. But. he threw your father down a flight of stairs. I think. I think he seems like a nice man. And you like him. Right? He doesn't seem like a killer. Maybe he isn't. I mean He hasn't killed anybody recently,has he? I don't think so. I knew he had a history Fundamental scientific laws govern the ability of an engine to convert energy in the fuel to an energy form that can make a car move. Scientific principles, huh? Yeah. It's what they call the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Where'd you learn all this stuff? In prison. I read this book. Why'd you kill Pearl's father? I suppose I was pretty angry You suppose? I mean, don't you know? Christ, you killed a man. Neither of us wanted to kill each other when we started.We just kinda lost control. Why'd you go over to his place, anyway? Wanted to apologize to him for killing his daughter And you threw him down a flight of stairs. Yeah , Something like that. Why'd you run? I was scared It sounds like it was an accident Killing a man is killing a man. Yeah, I guess so How is Pearl anyway? She's OK She's a difficult woman. How 'bout you? You gotta main squeeze? No. Ever? No. Ouch. The first thing you notice about having a girlfriend. You know,right off the bat, when you start staying over her house and everything Is you start cleaning yourself a lot better - Really ? - Yeah,no shit You just start paying more attention to everything Like,I don't know,cleaning your teeth before you go to bed And worrying about washing your back Your back ? Yeah your fucking back Right down the middle.It's almost impossible to do Who the hell thinks about it anyway. Girls do, I guess I suppose it must get kinda dirty down there.With all that sweat and everything But you never see the goddamn thing. Underwear. Suddenly I'm buying underwear Must be really different when somebody seeing you without your clothes on all the time. Yeah, Damn straight! So how do you stand this celibacy shit? How does anybody stand anything? Being in prison for all those years helps. But didn't you get any before the crash? My friends were always making fun of me So one night I took Pearl's sister to the movies I was determined I knew she liked me and she was as pretty as Pearl is Anyway. we drove to the movie, and we kissed and all that Then I picked up 6 pack of beer, Then drove out to this place that I knew. You sure you don't want a beer? Aren't you curious? - Are not you curious? - Most of the time. But,see I killed a man I never thought I'd be able to do that. I mean. When you've done something unimaginable When you've done it even before you ever thought about it When you see how easy it is . Then everything is put into this new perspective Suddenly things you thought were the most important things in the world are no more significant than anything else. Because, you've done the unimaginable. You've done what you thought was impossible. And then you see . you see that you can do anything. You ain't a homo, are you? No. I mean, I don't have anything against guys liking other guys as long as they don't like me - You know what I'm saying? - Sure -I thought I was a homo once. - Really ? - Yeah. Fucking unbelievable. - What happened? I joined the Marines. They straightened my shit right out. See my tattoo? My, Audry, you look so elegant in this one! You should've seen some of the awful clothes they had there. Well, I like this one. Oh, yeah, that one's allright. Kinda tight, though. It shows off your breasts well Will you two shut up! I think Mr Whitbred did a really nice job. Very professional.. He better have. I paid seven hundred and fifty bucks for those Audry! Don't get your dirty hands all over 'em! They are clean! Wow! Audry, you really do have some figure. Mom, cut it out. Don't be silly, Audry. Flaunt it while you have it. I'm just about losing mine. - You look OK. - Liar. You look great. Don't she, Dad? Look. Can't you two see I'm trying to eat! Mom, straighten your back. I learned this today. What, like this? After a while Look, right here - in the raincoat with the umbrella. - Holy shit! Look at that! Ain't that something? Audry right there in the goddamn newspaper. She made five hundred bucks for one day's work. - No shit? - Damn straight. Hey, Josh, look at this! You know Vic's daughter,Audry, right? Pretty girl Right. OK, let's get back to work.Josh You almost through with that Mustang? Just gotta set the points on in and then I get started on the Firebird. -Right,let's get 'em all finished up today. -Right You don't think you ride him a little too hard He can take it. BUT Well, I think that maybe it would be a good thing If she's not sure what she wants to study Maybe it would be worthwhile for her to take a year off and just work Make some money Dad, I promise. It'll just be a year. At the end of a year, I'll make so much money, maybe I will be able to pay for college all by myself. We had a deal, remember. - I remember - I held up my end. I appreciate that. - Shit. - Audry, eat your vegetables. THEN - Emmet, you look terrible - I tell you Audrey. I'm a wreck! - You look really nice in that dress. - I'm sorry. - I'm gonna kill myself. - Oh Emmet, Don't be maudlin Well, then I'll kill somebody else. - Where are you going, anyway? - To work - Oh not Modeling - Sweaters I hate seeing you in those advertisements where other men can slobe all over you. I make a lot of money. Since when are you so interested in making money? Since I started earning it Why are you so happy lately? Don't you know the world's fucked? Did you read the paper today? Emmet, I know the world's fucked. I don't read the papers any more And, have you bathed lately? Emmet, really, you smell You're in love with that homicidal auto mechanic, aren't you? Emmet, I'm gonna kill you. It won't last. I know it won't last. Emmet, you know what the ancient Greeks said about happiness. Fuck the ancient Greeks. - Here's my ride - Don't go ! Emmet, tie your shoe Hi. Good afternoon, Mr Hutton. - You don't have to call me mister - What am I supposed to call you? You can call me anything you like, but you don't have to call me mister.

If he's so horrible and dangerous, why'd you hire him? Well, I ah. I'm a. I'm letting him go tomorrow. You wouldn't dare. Oh yes I would. Without Josh your whole business would fall down around your ears! Don't tell me about my business, Audrey. Ok? You know you need a good mechanic! And he's a good mechanic! Since when do you know so much about auto repair? Huh?

She was paid good money for that Why can't she model sweaters or raincoats? You were the one that encourage her to going into modeling in the first place Audrey! - Hi. Thanks, I have your wrench. - Are you OK? - This is a really nice house - Your knee! - Oh, it's nothing. - Here, sit down - I've got some band-aids in the house. - No. It's OK. The House belonged to my father. It's been vacant for years. Do you like the book? Oh, yeah.That's great. Thanks. I have others. - Books ? - No, Wrenches. I have plenty at work. But this one is yours, right? It's your personal wrench Yeah I thought so. So I thought I'd return it to you Why? 'Coz I thought you need it. Well It's true.I might but. I mean. if you need it, you can use it. - Really ? - Sure Thanks What's that? - These are planetary gears - What is it do? Well . it's . transmission. In a car. Right. How does it work? Well, it's a little bit complicated. I have all the time in the world Are you really wanna know? I mean it's really interesting what people do. I mean, when they do something that they love Because when you do something that you love, no matter what it is you do it well. And when you do something well, you feel useful. And it's important to feel useful, I think. Because. Because well there's so much in life that seems. pointless. Well, OK. An automatic transmission. There are manual transmissions too.They do the same thing, just a bit differently. Transmissions works by changing which gears transmit power in the engine to power in the wheels The car. Automatic transmission use planetary gears. - You follow me ? -Uh-huh You see here, It is the sun gear here in the middle Will you make love to me? Wait here. Get out of here, Audry. Go on What do you mean, you wanna move out? Someone offered me an apartment in New York City for six months. No way ! But, Victor, she works in the city all the time. She spends almost a hundred dollars a month just on train fare. So what! She can afford it! Christ,the damn kid makes more than me! What do you want ? - I just wanna explain. - There's nothing to explain. Thanks for lending me the book. I have a library card now. What are you reading ? History History is gonna come to an end. Soon. Why are you so sure the human race is going to kill itself? - Because it can - That doesn't necessarily mean it will.. The human race has never invented anything it didn't use - True, But It's not the last word. - What's the last word? I do not know. Faith, maybe? Which one? Faith or maybe? I'd like to see you again It's too late. You had your chance. - Let me explain - I have a deal to keep. - Fuck the deal - There are rules. - Break them! - I can't My father has made good on his end of the deal What deal? Everything in life is just deals You can't get anything for nothing Unless you have nothing to begin with. Are you telling me I should feel sorry for you? I'm not talking about me at all. I've got nothing to feel sorry about Mr hot-shot auto mechanic! philosopher! And I know exactly what I'm doing, so just drop dead You can't have faith in people Only the deals you make with them People are only as good as the deals they make And keep. I know what you need. Excuse me? You need a woman. - That girl's crazy. - I know, but I like her. - She's leaving town. - So I've heard. So come on.What do you say?

I know what you need. - Excuse me - That girl's crazy. A MONTH MAYBE TWO MONTHS LATER Audry makes up her own mind. If she wants to live in the city and earn her own keep, What's that got to do with me? She's eighteen now. She does what she wants. I can't stand it. Every single magazine I open I see her! Emmet, you gotta pull yourself together. How can you stand it.All these complete strangers ogling her?! It's better than you ogling her in the flesh. Besides, she's only gonna do it for a year. Then she's going to Harvard to study journalism. That's what she really wants to do, you know. This modeling stuff is just a phase. Mike! What the hell are you doing? Shut up and Get off the boat! Oh Hi Ms. Hugo, How are you? Hi, Josh. I heard about Audry's picture in the Sunday Times. Yeah. Three pictures. It's a whole, you know, spread. - You must be really proud of her. - We are. We're gonna go to church now, then we'll gonna go buy the paper. And have a few people back to the house. That's nice Josh . Josh, you go into the city occasionally, don't you? - Every once in a while. - Oh, good! How about tomorrow? Would you take these earrings in to Audry for me? She's out of the country right now but she'll be back tomorrow Come on, Liz, let's go. Ah! Josh . If you get a chance take a look at hydraulic jack, - It's been sticking all week. - Right - Hi, Pearl. - Hi, Mike. Oh Look Everyone's here This is so exciting ! It's killing me. She's got nothing on Not in this one either. Well, I think it's an ad for jewelry, I think. She's absolutely naked. - You don't see much. - We see enough. Pearl, let's go back and put some charcoal on the barbecue Hold it! I know what you slobs are thinking. You're thinking, She's a fucking slut! Well I would tell you people something You people make me wanna throw up! You think what she does is easy? This is hard work!You think she just gets up there and takes her clothes off? Huh? is a skill! And she gets paid damn well to do it! Does any of you make a thousand dollars a day? Huh! Huh! Why, she's in Europe right now! You all like to go on vacations and you all like to drive nice cars! Why hold it against her when she gets it? Come on Vic, we don't hold anything against her. I can see it in your eyes! You're all saying how can he let her do it! Doesn't he have any shame? Well, I wanna tell you the only thing I'm ashamed of Is that I didn't think of it sooner! There's money to be made out there and if you gotta get your goddamn hands dirty to get it well then so what! Josh! Vic . Mike. Mrs Hugo, I just wanted to say I don't think this is right. And then there's that one. Who? Josh? He's OK. A goddamn mass murderer always making eyes at my daughter. I had to send her away to live in the city! I had no choice. I don't think you gotta worry about Josh. What are you talking about? Gimme that bottle. Well,he's not very interested in girls What do you mean?you mean . He's a fag? No! he's like a. priest or something. No man is like a priest. Priests aren't even like priests when it comes to women. Well, It's different with Josh All he ever thinks about is engines He was telling me this stuff the other day you wouldn't believe it All this scientific shit. Amazing He doesn't have time to think about anything else Look,If you ask me Audry be safer around Josh than she would be around Anybody You think so ? Absolutely. I mean it's right, but. - I don't think it's what Audry wants. - But isn't it what you want? This is what I want. Maybe She doesn't know what she wants. That's what I mean. How are you, Josh? Glad you could stop by! Come over here a minute. I wanna talk to you. Josh, have a seat Well, Josh This ain't easy for me to say. I know you like Audry Well, to be completely out in the open and up front about everything Audrey's crazy about you. You look surprised. But listen to me, Josh.I ain't kiddin' you. The girl sleeps with your crescent wrench. Well, I. appreciate you saying that Look Take tomorrow off She's flying in from Europe tomorrow afternoon some time I think it'd be a great surprise for her to find you when she got home Here's the address where she's living in the city She's living with a friend.

Show her a good time! You know how girls are You gotta spend some money on them. They eat it up! Look , Josh You know, I'm not a real romantic type But I think this could be a really beautiful thing Mike! What the hell are you doing? - Hey, aren't you the guy. - Back off! It wasn't me! I wasn't even there! - You'll play something? - Maybe. Cigarette? No! I don't want a cigarette! you know I ain't a beggar man I'm an entertainer! I'm an artist - I don't drink. - What ? - I don't drink. - Bullshit! Everybody drinks. I don't Why the hell not? Hey, you're a priest? I'm a mechanic. Really ? My ex-wife's husband is a mechanic He drinks it. Well,I don't I don't believe you. - You don't believe I don't drink - No, I don't believe you're a mechanic. I am I think you're a man of God! I'm a mechanic. So, Why don't you have a drink with me? What, am I not good enough for ya? The last time I took a drink I got in a car crash and I killed a girl. No ! Yeah. That's enough to drive you to drink. I've been in prison They put you in jail for a car accident! No, not for that Few years later, I get into an arguement with the girl's father. and I killed him too. - No shit! - Yeah. How? I pushed him down a flight of stairs. Why you do that? He was hammering away at my face pretty bad So I kept laying in to his chest with everything I had Next thing you knew. boom Dead? Broken neck. Smashed skull. I didn't even see it happen. You got a cigarette? Yeah. Do we have to listen to that bum making all that racket? I like it Come on, Audrey! You disgust me Why do you live here with me then if you won't let me touch you? Because I can. It's free. And I'm greedy. Nothing is free, Audrey. Greedy people know that I can throw you out! - You won't - Don't count on it Here's money for the rent. I don't want your money. Money is all I have You wouldn't be living like this if it wasn't for me. You make a lot of money of me too pal You're getting a damn good deal having me as your personal manager! But you're not still satisfied are you? The immediate effects of a . twentymegaton bomb are not different in Come on. You have to play the game. Life ain't pretty! You gotta make compromises Life is all compromises. You don't get something for nothing! You could do a lot worse than a guy like me. I'm not a rich man, but I'm doing OK for a guy my age.I'm leveraged. I have money in real estate. I own art Two Andy Warhol prints! Valuable stuff! That car outside. You know how much that baby costs? This vase here alone is worth over six thousand dollars. You see, I've been smart. Assets. Tons of assets. And I'm in great shape. I go to the most expensive gym in town. I have nothing. - I don't want anything. I want you. - Is that all? - You owe me. We had a deal. - We made no deal. We had an understanding. I never said I understood anything. Do you really think I let you live here out of the goodness of my heart? Oh my God ! My fucking vase! Josh. How are you, Pearl? Can I talk to you? I'm not much in the mood for talking right now. It's important. Would you like to go down to the water? Let's go to my house. Can we walk? You guys seen Pearl? She just left. With Josh Hutton. Pearl? You OK in there You didn't kill him. Kill who? My father. What do you mean ? He. He hit you real hard and you fell in through the bathroom door. you didn't move again and then He stepped out into the hallway at the top of the stairs and then he saw me. I startled him He stepped back and . He fell. When. So when they asked me. They asked me if you had shoved him. And I just nodded. I've hated you Everybody did All I ever knew was that you killed my sister and I supposed to hate you. I've hated you even more since then. I made myself hate you more and more. Then I just tried not to think about it. And I forgot. I forgot you didn't kill him. You didn't kill him. I read in the papers recently about this big miscarriage of justice somewhere. A man had got to prison for five years before all was sorted out He went to court and sued the state He got lot of money Maybe you could do something like that. I don't need the money. Mike? Fuck you! Mike, It's all right. I told him to Oh yeah ? Nice touch Vic! Mike! Dad ! What are you doing here ? Hello, Mom? It's me. I'm at Josh Hutton's house. everybody's here. I think you should come over. Dad's really flipping out Yeah Allright I see you Bye Audrey? Did you make love to Josh? No. Did you? - No. - Why not ? I just got here - Pearl, what are you doing here? - Sleeping - Didn't you sleep here? - No, I just came from the city. That bastard! - Dad ! - That thief ! He owes me five hundred bucks! Come on Mike, where are you going?huh? Calm down ! I go out of my way to convince Vic that Audrey's safe around you And what do you do? You put the moves on Pearl I wouldn't do that Don't be an idiot Where are you going ? I'm gonna drown myself! What the fuck do you care? What the hell is your problem! Where's my money? I don't have your money any more! I gave you five hundred bucks to get Audry and bring her back! You didn't do it and kept the money - I didn't even want the money! - You didn't hold up your end of the deal! - We didn't heve any deal! - We had an understanding! You don't understand anything! You can't trust anybody. - Where were you? - Where were you? I waited for you till five o'clock at the beach house. You said you'd meet me there at four! Oh, I got hung up. Why didn't you call me? I didn't have a quarter. What's wrong with you?, Vic? Nothing is wrong with me. I want my money! Pearl says you're innocent. Innocent of what? - He didn't kill Pearl's father. - What ? Dad, since Josh is not a murderer, all the deals We've made are now null and void. Oh, no! You still gotta go to college! I'll go to college when I feel like it. What about the money I gave that insane charity thing? $ 11,000. All the money I have in the world. It's yours. I've decided I can't have faith in what I can't see. What do you want to see? The world. What about this Whitbred guy? He means nothing to me. How do I know that? You have to trust me. I don't trust anyone. So do you have any money? $ 12. How about you ? No I don't have my tools either - I have your wrench. - Oh,good.that'll do. I suppose we're car thieves now? You just gave your father eleven thousand dollars. But there was no agreement, no deal. Yeah, just money! Hold it What ? Do you hear that? No. What is it? Listen ENNUI I've always known I'd die in a crash without knowing I had, or meaning to, as if the road was make-believe and I was oblivious to the death-bearing walls, trees, houses that lie in wait. Ah, Sophie! Martin. - Who are all those people? - My friends. Have you had time to make so many? Contrary to what you think, the world is full of nice people. Here. Agnis is dying to meet you. This is embarrassing. But yes, I am a fan. Never mind if I sound like a groupie. I really worked to get on your course, I've read all your writing. It's brilliant, it makes me feel intelligent. You'll think this is flattery but I mean it, I have to say so. - You're not listening. - Yes, yes. You're very kind. No I am not, I am sincere. You just stand there totally remote. Martin, what are you doing? Have you seen Sophie? - She says you've a book on. - I wish she wouldn't. - Won't you discuss it? - I've not started. - You must have a theme. - I won't discuss it. - That Jean-Paul.? - Want to meet him? No, no thanks. What's wrong? Are you all right? I don't know, I feel unwell. What about Agnis? Pretty, isn't she? So what? I reckon she's yours. Don't matchmake, it doesn't suit you. I mean it, she's great. Stop looking so pleased, it's unbearable. What a spoilsport. I'm really happy tonight, you won't ruin it. Are you a friend of Sophie's? No. Why? Nothing. Never mind. You do look happy. The thing is Jean-Paul and I have gone through an unbelievable experience. What? We never thought it would happen, - it's something. - What? I can't tell you now. Let's just say I've never felt that with anyone before. Not even me? Definitely not you. He hit me. Hit me, knocked me about, as you please. I felt an incredible surge of love. Shut up! Shut up! I don't care! Is there any champagne left? Maybe some beer, in the bottom. This is Jean-Paul. I was expecting you to be different. What did she say? We never discuss you. Aren't you obsessed with me? I think I've dealt with you. Fine, I see! We're really made for each other! Wait, wait. Excuse me. Jean-Paul's got an odd sense of humour. That's not all that's odd. You've hit the jackpot. - I'm off. - OK. The only person I wanted to see was you but I see I can't. I tried, but I can't get into the swing. Pleasure does not cause pleasurable acts which can happen without pleasure. Pleasure completes the act, as an extra without which the act would not be perfect. Aristotle says men in their prime contain the vigour of youth. Perfect pleasure is a luxury and the attraction of pleasure is a love of the act. As Kant says, to finish, "the addition of pleasure makes the act a bonum consumatum". You are in perfect health. Are you sure? What is wrong? Everything. You do seem jittery. I am, I'm jittery. You should see a psychiatrist. No, no psychiatrist, I'm a philosopher. Psychiatrists are too rational. Well. Find a young lady, take her on a trip. I can't, I need my energy for my work. I have to finish my book, I have given up love. Really? Yes, I need sublimation. Freud is very good on that. Is he? He says certain acts that seem unrelated to sex are motivated by sexual compulsion, specially intellectual or artistic acts. A man without sublimation is pathetic, a lunatic with a tyrannical penis and a tiny brain. Do you want a drink? No thanks. You feeling low? No, I'm fine. I haven't made love for 6 months. I'm sorry I've lost my wallet. Sure! It's OK, I'll get some cash. I've heard that one before. Problem? Of course not! I can't pay! I'll fetch some money from home and be right back. - How much does he owe you? - None of your business. I'll pay his bill. Was it you who paid? Yes. - Take it. - No. Take it. It's not worth much money but it means a lot to me. If it means so much, keep it! Till I can pay you back. My address is there. - Sure you're OK? - I'm fine. You've given me a bond, have a drink. A drink? I don't like to waste time. All I do is work. The address is there. I'm looking for Leopold Meyers. - The painter? - Yes. Is it in the courtyard? It was in the courtyard. Has he moved? No. He died. Died? He can't. I met him three days ago. Maybe, he died yesterday afternoon. Suddenly. Really? He died at a special moment. Meaning? He was making love with a very young girl. Oh really? The doctor says it wasn't normal love. According to him, she killed him. I was just getting my stuff before they clear the place. I was his model, I had the key. That's how I got in. I'll be off. Did you come often? Nearly everyday. When did he die? Yesterday afternoon. Were you there? Yes, he had an attack while I was posing. Was he doing a portrait? Where's the canvas? There's this one. It's not a good likeness. How can you tell? The body is different. Well it's mine, that's how I am. It may be exaggerated, but that's how I really am. There's only the one. No, this is me and this. And that one. He was always doing me, I had to sit for hours. A lot of trouble considering. - Why? - It's very bad painting. I know nothing about painting. Really, he was just obsessed. - Obsessed? - Obsessed with sex. Definitely. I want to go. When he died you were making love? Yes. Where? Up in the bedroom. I'd like to see it. Can I? Of course. This is it. How long had you known him? Two years. How old are you? 17. Tell me how you met. - Why? - Because I'm interested. - We met at a friend's. - Named? - Elise. - And you are? Cecilia. What was he doing at this friend's? Teaching her drawing. Did he teach you too? Did you hear me? Why do you want to know this? Let's say you interest me. One day I asked for a lesson but he refused. Really? Why? At first I thought he didn't want me to see his place so I suggested mine, but he still refused. Why did you want lessons so badly? Why? I was in love with him. And he ignored you. He didn't fancy me. Well? Two months went by, it was terrible, I was in love. - In the end, I tricked him. - Tricked him? I knew Elise was coming here I told a friend to ask her out and I came in her stead. How did he feel about it? He tried to send me away, then he got nicer. And you made love? How did you guess? Why didn't he want you at first? He didn't fancy me, I told you. Maybe he was scared. Why scared? Because he knew he would fall in love with you. Love is frightening. - I am not scared. - Of what? Love. He could have been your father's father, why fall for him? There's no why to love. You just love. There's a why to everything. I was attracted to him. Why? He was like my Dad, I used to have a crush on my Dad. A crush? I dreamt about him at night. So Meyers fell in love with you. Yes. Very much in love? Yes. Why? I don't know. What did he say? Sometimes he cried. He cried? He'd take his head in his hands and cry. Didn't you know why? - Didn't he say? - No. He just cried, without a word. No, he always spoke. Like what? Like he couldn't live without me. He wanted to but he couldn't. He never said he wanted to. In fact, when I wanted to leave, he tried to kill himself. Really? How? Pills, sleeping pills he took. Was he insomniac? Some nights he only slept an hour or two. Because of you? He said everything was because of me. How so? Why are you asking all this? Because I am intrigued by your story. How? I don't know, that's why I'm asking, I'm asking because I want to know. Why was everything your fault? He needed me more and more. How did he need you more? - In every way. - In that you made love? - Yes. - Often? At first once or twice a week, then every day then two or three times a day. - By the end I stopped counting. - Why? He wanted it all the time. He was never satisfied? No, but he got tired. Sometimes, he'd feel unwell but he couldn't get enough. Did you like that? A woman always likes to see a man loves her. You don't think it was sheer vice? No, he loved me. How can you be sure? - One knows. - Is that all? No but he wanted to marry me. Wasn't he married? - He'd have divorced. - Would you've accepted? No. Why not? Why not? Because I didn't love him. I thought you were madly in love. Only at first. So now he meant little or nothing, you meant everything or nearly. Is that it? Yes, that's it. He often said, "You are everything." Why are you smiling? I'm not smiling. Yes you are, you're looking knowingly. Tell me it isn't true. You're trying to tell me you're open to me as you were to Meyers. Tell me I'm wrong. I assume I am not wrong. You're offering yourself as an object. Take this chair, it doesn't have your eyes, breasts, hips, but it is offered me as you are, innocently. Yet I must reject it, it is nothing to me, there's no relationship. You can make a relationship. In theory, yes. But, how can I say? The only relationship I can have with a woman is nothing, such as exists between us or rather does not exist. We've only known each other half-an-hour. That changes nothing. I'm impotent if you like. I'm not, actually, but it is as if I were. You must think I am. What are you doing? I'm going. I'm sorry, I'm late. Right, I'm listening. What can I do? I am unable to continue teaching, I need a sabbatical. You want to do some research? I need some time, I want to write a book. I didn't know you wrote. It's not yet written, I've got notes, I need to work. What is it about? It's hard to summarize. - Is it in your field? - Meaning what? Is it philosophy? Everything is philosophy. Yes quite, and why not? It can be a change of field. Put in an application, I'll. I can't wait till next year. I can't continue, it is beyond me. Why the hurry? The fact is that for some time, for six months my wife and I separated, I've realized I can't stand myself, I have no patience with books, films. I can't concentrate, not even on music. I want to see no one, yet I can't stay alone, I can't stay at home, I can't go out, I can't sleep, I want to work but I can't, there's nothing. except revulsion. I even thought I wanted to die. It's not a sabbatical you need. You need a doctor, a specialist. Do you think? If it's urgent, take time off. I won't get paid! Do you know what's special about you? You're punctual. That's very special. Cecilia. Can I talk to you? Why? I need to, after, I have to talk or I worry. Talk then. Did Meyers say why he loved you? Meyers again. Let's talk about something else. What would you like? I don't know. Why not Meyers, then? Since I'm interested. What do you need to know? Did he say why he loved you? No, he just did. There's always a deeper reason. Meyers was crazy about you. You said so yourself, you were his vice. Why this mania? I don't know. You don't seem the kind of woman to inspire grand passion. That's true. And if I can speak my mind, now I know you, I'm surprised, disappointed. From what you said, I thought you'd be a daunting woman, a woman to destroy a man. You seem very ordinary. You'd make a great wife. Think so? Yes, I do. Me too, actually. So why Meyers' passion for you? I can't explain. Try, please. I can't, that's how it was. Meaning? Ask me a proper question, I'll answer. A proper question? You always ask about feelings or thoughts. I never know what to say. For instance. Did Meyers know that your relationship was bad for his health? Yes. And what did he say? He said, "I'll die of this." Then he added, "It doesn't matter." "It doesn't matter"? One day, we were making love. He said, "Carry on, don't mind me, "even if I protest, even if I feel unwell, "and I die, really die." He loved you because you made him die. He committed suicide with you, a successful attempt, in full knowledge. Maybe you're right. One can know stuff but one can't escape one's fate. I have to go. Good. I have to work. Martin, stop being so listless and lifeless, stop enjoying your depression. Abstinence is turning you sour. Give it up. I have done. Really? Do I know her? No, I met her in odd circumstances, a few weeks ago. Really? You must be pleased. You're quite wrong, I don't like her at all. She's totally uninteresting, I'm trying to get rid of her. Why? Is she ugly? Not particularly. Is she stupid then? No. Not at all. She never says anything stupid. It's complicated. She bores me, I have no contact with her. Or rather only physical contact. Why complain? That's not so bad. You can't imagine how basic she is, she has no conversation. When she speaks, she sounds silent. Her only means of expression is sexual. Sometimes, when she's lying there, legs apart, I find her cunt more expressive than her mouth. Yet, oddly, she is not sensual, she's only frenetic and avid. When she kisses, her lips are flaccid, cold, inert but her cunt is hard-hitting, domineering. When we make love. her belly moves powerfully, rhythmically, like a machine, she is unstoppable. She goes at me, goes at herself, to make me come, make herself come, to the last spasm. After orgasm, then. her face is calm, expressionless. She smiles like she does not see me. It's not coldness, not detachment, it's something else. Listen, you're lying, she doesn't exist. Hey! Taxi! Come quick. Hold me tight. Can you close the curtain? Why? I can't make love in the light. Sorry, could you close the bedroom door? I can't make love with the door open. You're so complicated! Sorry, could you unhook the phone? Yesterday it rang at a climax and though I didn't reply, it spoilt it. Third time lucky. Just one more thing, please. Grab my cigarettes, on the desk. I love, I love to make love. here! And the matches? As I am up is there anything else? Yes, now you mention it. Go and switch the gas off in the kitchen. And? Put some music on. The radio, not too loud. What is it? Why won't you do as I say? Just those two things, or is there more? Just those two. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry but. you must get up again. I need an ashtray. I hate ash on the floor. I'm sorry. - See you tomorrow. - Yes. Cecilia's just left. I'm so ashamed. What is it? I was cruel to her. Sometimes she seems vacuous and opaque like an object. I bring her to life by making her suffer, by tormenting her. Cruelty is repulsive, it's weak. - You are weak. - How so? Nothing, I didn't mean it. I called for some comfort, not for sarcasm, I'm hanging up. Fine. Wait, I need your help. She is making me a sadist, because she bores me. I have to leave her. I don't want to hurt her, she loves me. How do you know she loves you? I feel it. If I were you, I'd be careful. How can I make a break-up less humiliating? Maybe. A gift. I was passing by. I tried to call. - You don't look pleased. - I am. But what's the time? Noon. Can we have lunch? OK, a quick one. I'm in a rush. Jean-Paul and I. What? We've broken up. Do you know what he did? I hardly got through the door, he slapped me. Not the first time, I think. Before it was out of love. This was a hateful slap. I felt it immediately, I scratched him. - A hateful slap? - Sure. Love and hate are things you feel. Anyway he admitted he'd started hating me. So we decided to separate. That was good. What do you mean? Well of course. What time is it? 12.22 Right, I'm off. No, listen. you're joking, we haven't begun. I told you I had not much time. We'll meet one evening and talk. Sorry, I've an appointment. With Cecilia, I expect. I thought you'd left her. I'm going to today. Actually, I did ages ago. I'm not sure I follow. I told you, we have no contact. Except sexual contact. You're too down-to-earth. I'm off. At last. I didn't call this morning, my telephone was out of order. Are we meeting? Same time? Why didn't you come yesterday? - I couldn't. - Why not? I was busy. Fine. See you later. If a woman stands you up, does it mean she doesn't love you? Not necessarily. Waiter! If a woman never says she loves, can she still be in love? - And vice-versa. - Vice-versa? Vice-versa. Excuse me. If a woman enjoys sleeping with a man is it that she is in love? Definitely. Can you tell me the time? My watch has stopped. It's two. Two! I feel time has stopped today. First, I have to tell you something. No, kiss me first. Tell me. We can't see each other everyday anymore only twice a week. Really? Why? Don't get excited. I am not getting excited, I want to know why. My folks are complaining I'm out everyday. Didn't you tell them you were doing drawing again? Yes but twice a week. I have to find excuses for the other days. Your parents didn't mind your seeing Meyers everyday. Meyers was over sixty. They knew him, they weren't suspicious. Well introduce me then. Fine, till then it's twice a week. Tell the truth, you don't want to see me. That's nothing to do with it. I'm only saying it's twice a week from now on. You want us to break up, you won't admit it. You say twice a week, tomorrow it'll be twice a month. You'll admit it in the end. Admit what? As you wish. It's twice a week from now on. Let's change the subject. What's wrong? You look cross. Let's change the conversation. I walked right by you, you didn't notice. Really? Where? By the town hall, outside the park. At what time? About two. I was with an actor friend. What's his name? Momo. That isn't a name. It's what I call him. You seemed very intimate. From your walk. - What walk? - Get up. - Why? - Get up! He always walks like that. Have you known him long, Momo? Two weeks. Do you see him much? Occasionally. Did you have an appointment? Yes, he wants me to go into films. And? Are you? I don't know yet. Then what? Where did you go? To have a coffee. And after that? We went to the park, till I came here. - Do you want to make love? - No, I want to know the truth. - What truth? - The truth. - Any truth! - I don't understand you. Yesterday you didn't show. Today, you want to come less often. What's behind all this? I said, my parents are cross. Do you really mind not seeing me everyday? Yes. Well forget what I said. We'll meet everyday. We'll have to be more careful, we'll meet at different times. I'll call every morning to fix a time. Happy now? Yes. Thank you. If you like we can meet 4 times a week instead of 7. No, everyday. I'll find excuses. Did you think I was cheating on you with Momo? It was wonderful today. Isn't it always? No it's different every time. Today was wonderful. Why? You can't say. - Know how often I came? - How often? Three times. Don't you always? No. Did Meyers really die making love? Why do you want to know? I want to. Well? He had an attack making love but he died later. You're lying. It's the truth. I was terrified. I thought he'd died. Luckily he came round. I got him into bed. - Weren't you on the bed? - No. Where were you? You're so curious! Where were you? On the stairs. He wanted to make love all the time. Did you cheat on Meyers? There you go again! Answer, please! Did you? Occasionally. He was so dull. Meaning? Dull. I have to go. Right, now I have to go. Look in the room, there's a present for you. For me! Thank you. Stop, stop, I have to go. - You're sulking again. What is it? - Nothing. So have you managed to leave her? No, she didn't come to the meeting. You must have felt silly with the present. Do you think I'm dull? Why? I think Cecilia's cheating on me because I'm dull. I thought it was you that found her dull. True. I do find her dull. It sounds dodgy to me. The more I take her, the less I own her. Making love so often uses up the energy I'd need to possess her. You are off your head, you really are. I don't feel like a movie, let's go eat. I'm going to the movies. Do as you wish. Did Meyers go to your place often? - Nearly everyday. - What for? Lunch, or for a coffee. Did you make love at your place? Sometimes. - Where? - I don't know. Try and remember. Once, in the kitchen. In the kitchen! Couldn't you in the bedroom? When he wanted it, he did it on the spot. Don't forget it's my lesson today, after lunch we're going to you. Why should I say that? You must do the washing-up. I'll do it all tonight, and yesterday's. And the day before? Mummy, this is my teacher. I'm sorry, pleased to meet you. I didn't know your teacher had come. Show him into the sitting-room. Have you forgotten my surname? No! I don't know it! You're Martin. I never thought to ask. What is your name? Never mind. I feel unspeakable today. As you please. Daddy, this is my drawing-master. I don't speak. Sit here with my father, I'll lay the table. How do you do? He says he's not deaf, don't shout. I'm sorry, I was asking, how do you do? He says when there's a lot of wind, the days seem even longer. Are you not working? He says, he can't work right now, he will when he improves. Are you under treatment? He's doing X-rays and hopes to be better within a year. We're ready. Do sit down. You knew Professor Meyers, did you not? I did, a little. He was so nice, so friendly and clever. I was so upset when he died. Yes, he was still young. Exactly 65. He looked 50. We'd only known him 2 years, but he was like family. He was fond of Cecilia, she was like a daughter to him. - Granddaughter. - Yes. He wouldn't take money for the lessons. "Intelligence is free" he'd say. Perhaps I should give free lessons too. That's different. He was specially fond of her. - Did he come often? - Nearly everyday. He had a place at table. Not that he was indelicate, he was always trying to repay us. He'd share expenses, send cakes, wine, flowers. He'd say, you are like family. Poor man, he was separated. He lived alone. Pass your plate. Write, he does not understand. He won't write, he is not dumb. Strangers don't understand you. He'd do better writing. He says Meyers was dislikeable. One wonders why. He said Meyers was over-familiar. My husband is absurd. Did you understand? He says Meyers was seducing me. Meyers used to compliment me, he played the suitor, it went no further. - Excuse me.- Yes. There you are. Move over, I need to do my hair. - What does your father do all day? - Nothing. Nothing? How so? - Nothing. That's all. - No one does nothing. He sits in a chair, listens to the radio. - What's wrong? - Cancer. What do the doctors say? That he's got cancer. Do they say he'll get better? No. So he'll die. Yes, soon he'll be dead. - Are you upset? - Yes. Is that all you can say? What else can I say? I fear the doctors are right. - Meaning? - He'll soon be dead. Yes. They say he'll soon be dead. What'll you do? What'll we what? What will you live off? Same as now. What do you live off? - We have a shop. - A shop! You never said. You never asked. - Is it profitable? - No. It is not. Do you ever think about death? No, I never do. - Even when you see your father? - No. Anyone else would. I'm fine. Why think about death? There's others too. Well, maybe. Are you not sure? Yes. And does your father think about death? - Is he frightened? - And how! - So he knows he's dying. - No, he doesn't. - Do you never worry about it?- About what? His dying. As long as he's alive I only think about that. Do you know I want you? I noticed. Come on, I'll get changed. Your mother's very like you. Yes. Physically. What about temperament? What do you mean? Is she nice, mean, calm, nervous? What's she like? She's like nothing. Well she knew about Meyers. No she didn't. Well why didn't she give me your father's exact words? What words? Do you think I didn't notice? Your father said he didn't like Meyers because he chased you. Your mother tried to make me think it was her he was chasing. Yes. Why did she want me to think Meyers was after her? - Because it was true. - What was true? That Meyers was after her. I asked him to, so she wouldn't see he was in love. Very clever. Come on. Are we going to my place? - I'm expecting a call. - So what? It depends on the call. Who's calling? A producer, for a meeting. Tell the truth, it's the actor. - What actor? - Momo. I saw him yesterday, I can't see him everyday. He took me to the producer's but he was busy. He's to call now. Momo's to call. Why not say so? I can, but it's not true. Can I reply for you? If you like. There's no need, I don't need proof. I only want you to know one thing. What? I don't want you to love me. I want you to tell the truth. The truth is I'm not seeing Momo today. But if you want I'll say I am. All right. All right. Goodbye. Come on. I'm in a rush, I have to see this producer. If you want us to make love, let's do it now. No. - Why not? - I don't like fast. Why fast? We'll do as usual, but I'll have to rush off. No, I said! Can you take me? You get me to bring you to your lover's because you can't face the bus. If only you were cruel or perverse, but you're only insensitive. Do you want to know why I wouldn't make love? Yes. Because I wanted for once not to be like Meyers. Stop! It's here! Bye! Who did you call? The line's been busy. - A girlfriend. - What girlfriend? Valentine. Valentine what? Valentine Voboronsky. Could I speak to Valentine, please? - She's out. - Since when? She left early this morning. Who wants to know? You lied. What did I say? You said Valentine called you, she's been out all day. So what? She was in a callbox. I hadn't thought of that. I've really lost it. It looks like that. I spend days by the phone waiting for your call, when it rings I'm a wreck, in case you're out or you lie. Do you know my phone rings at noon everyday and there you are like a secretary with our appointment? See you tomorrow. I'm so pleased you're there. It's been a while. How are you? Not well. Not at all. - Your voice is shaking. - Cecilia's cheating on me. Are you sure? No, I'm not! I can't tell. I try and identify her movements, I keep thinking she's lying. I can't even tell truth from lies. Is there any point knowing the truth? It's the only way I can kill my love. It is love, I have to admit it. I'm so tired. Detach yourself. She's cheating on me! How can I detach myself? I have to watch her, I have to see with my own eyes. Oh no, don't do that. I have to, there's no choice. - It'll be humiliating. - I don't care. Why don't you ever listen? Because it's useless, you don't understand. Fine, well don't call anymore! You again! What do you want? I've thought, I must see you. No way. - Why not? - I can't. Are you going to the producer's? - Is that it? - See you tomorrow. - Can I talk to Cecilia? - She's out. - When? - Fifteen minutes ago. She was meeting her actor friend who's meant to be getting her into film. They're seeing an important producer. Do you think she's got the makings of a star? Definitely, yes. Do you mind if I take your place? No, please do. Thank you. Would you like a coffee? That's very nice. Another coffee please. What'll it be? Nothing thanks. Yes, is Cecilia home yet? Cecilia's out. Are you sure? Have you checked the apartment? Of course I am! She must have arrived before me, or she's already left. Thanks a lot. Hello, yes. Just a minute. It's for you. OK, the usual. Fine. What is it now? What's so funny? I told you, it's none of your business. Hurry up, wash those glasses. Does she give good head? Bastard! Do you see a lot of Momo? Occasionally. So you know him well? Yeah, I know him well. - What do you think? - Meaning? What do you think of him? What do you reckon? I don't. Why should I? OK but how do you see him? What's he like? Nice. Is that all? Yes. He's nice. That's all. Well I'm nice, your father's nice. Being nice is meaningless. What am I meant to say? His strengths and weaknesses. Is he kind, mean, clever, stupid? Stingy, generous? I don't know. Anything. Won't you speak? I've nothing to say. I haven't thought. Well have you seen I've moved the bed? Yes. So you see the bed? Why shouldn't I? How come you see the bed and not what your actor is like? You see beds, not what people are like. - I'm told he's no good. - I wouldn't know. - How old is he? - I don't know. Is he older or younger than me? Maybe younger. By at least 10 years. Does he have a father, mother, siblings? I'm sure, we don't talk about it. What do you talk about? Lots of things. Like what? I don't know. We just talk. I can remember every one of our talks. I can't remember anything. If you had to describe him, what would you say? No one's forcing me so I don't have to. I'll tell you, he's tall, athletic, dark-eyed, his hair's yellow, his hands are big, his shoulders small. He looks vain. What does vain mean? It means stupid. You're right, his hands are big, his shoulders are small, now you mention it, I remember. If I hadn't, you wouldn't. I'm not like you, I don't see the detail. I only see if they're nice or not. What do you think of me? Tons of stuff. Really? Like what? I don't know. Tons of stuff. Just say one. Maybe because you're asking, I can't think. Of course. I feel I can't think at all. Not at all? No. But you said you thought lots of things. I know, I made a mistake. Don't you mind not thinking about the man you're making love with? No, why? Why think something? I'm going. Take me home, I'm late. Sophie, my mind's empty. Cecilia's escaping me, I can't possess her. My spirit's empty because reality escapes me, Cecilia and reality the words are linked, I know. They sound ever weaker in my mind. Excuse me, do you know the time? - What? - The time? Go on, out you come. Out! Go on my beauty, out! I'll pluck you like a flower. Get in! - What are you doing here? - And you? I've been to the producer's, he lives there. What's he called? Surname. First name. Quick! Leon Gayard. Where's he live? What floor? What number? 115 rue Ménilmontant, fourth floor. I saw you leave, you weren't alone. - Momo and I went together. - What for? - About a job. - What job? A film. What's it called? He didn't say. - Where did you see him? - In the sitting-room. Describe it, furniture, the apartment, quick! Like any other sitting-room. Such as. Well there were tables, chairs, sofas. What colour sofas? I didn't notice. I see. what colour are Momo's shorts? Did you check? I knew you'd start insinuating things again. There's no Gayard at 115 Ménilmontant. His number's not in the book. But there's a Momo, Maurice Mayard. There couldn't be. Look. What a coincidence. They share an address. Yes, Leon lives on the 4th and Momo on the 1st floor. Right, let's go see this Léon Gayard, we'll see if he lives there. - It's true. - What's true? Momo and I are together. Together? How so? I know you're together sometimes. We make love. - Just like that. - What else can I say? Why did you do it? Because I enjoyed it. Do you know you shouldn't? Why shouldn't I? You can't cheat on a man you love, you've often said you love me. I do but I love Momo too. So for your enjoyment you'll go with anyone, a painter, an actor, a mechanic. You're like a hungry beast, you're his, you're mine, our semen mixes in your belly. - Know what that means? - No. You're a whore. Do you realize how that changes things? Why won't you speak? - I've nothing to say. - You're a whore! You let me call you whore. Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Where to? We'd better not see each other. No, wait, we haven't spoken. Why bother speak? We're too different. Stay with me. Take me home. What are you doing? - I want to make love one more time. - It's over. Stay with me. Bitch! I'm right downstairs. Can I come up? - No. - Are you with someone? Several people. - Are you OK? - Fine. Why? Are you annoyed? I'm fed up with everything and everyone. What's wrong? I'm becoming a misanthrope. Misanthropes have high hopes, they're always disappointed. A dream of murder once a day helps keep the psychiatrist away. That's cheerful. Shit! What a surprise! How are you? - I'm Martin. - Pierre. - Have you eaten? - No. Want a drink? Sure, thanks. How's your book doing? My book? I think I see the end. Will we read it soon? I've lost a lot of time, but now I'll start living again I'll get down to work. Why? What's happened? I got too involved with someone. I couldn't concentrate, I was possessed, my mind went dead. I watched her daily but I never saw her leaving the actor's, I ended up thinking she was invisible. - What actor? - Her lover. Waiting was horrible, I was waiting for her to stop making love, every minute I pictured the scene inside, she takes off her jumper, naked, goes to the bed, she's on him, she comes. You can't predict feelings. I kept imagining her with him. When I finally did see them together, I never thought I could suffer so much. We have to go. Is he chasing you away? Not at all. It was lovely to see you again. Are you going too? I'll grab a lift with them. No, I can take you home. What about you? - Me? - Are you going? No. I'm off then. - Cecilia's got a lover. - So I gathered. I still want her, even more. Naturally. Don't despise her, she isn't like us. So now you'll share her. No, it's over. She can keep her actor. It won't last anyway. You should see his yellow hair. I'm sleepy. Please leave. I can't stay alone. Can I sleep here? No. What? I can't go home. I need to speak to you. About Cecilia? I've had it with her. - Why do you hate her? - I don't. I'm uninterested, I don't know her. But look at you, you're a wreck. Hug me, hug me in your arms. No! Get out of here. I can't believe this! Get the hell out! Can I speak to Cecilia? Cecilia? - Is she out? - She's asleep. Why? What time is it? Can you wake her? I must speak to her. Do we have to break up? We can carry on if you like. Why would you want to? I'm used to you. And if I say leave Momo? No. You could sound less firm. I'm sorry. You want us both. I can't help it, I like having you both. So I have to share you. What difference does it make? I'll still come as before. You can't love two men. Yes I can. Nice dress. Thanks. You look all happy. I'm happy because I'm with you. Thank you very much. What shall we do? Let's walk a while. What's wrong? Why say nothing? I want you too badly. You always do. - Don't you like that? - I didn't mean that. Let's go to my place. What's wrong? What's the matter? I forgot, I can't make love today. Why not? - Tummy ache. - Liar. Now do you believe me? With you, everything's always true. Why didn't you say so? We're spending all day together. Did you see him yesterday? - Who? - Who else? Yes, I did. Did you make love? You know that means we made love. Did you do it a lot? Same as usual. What do you feel when he takes you? One can't explain. Is it better than with me? I don't know. Why don't you? - I haven't thought. - Well try, please. I sense he loves me. And with me? With you too. Do you like it more or less? Do you enjoy it? All women like to feel loved. Do you like it more or less with me? It's different. OK, I've got it. What's the matter? There's no point talking. Tell me, if you couldn't see Momo, would you feel the lack? It's never happened. How can I know? Just try to imagine. Yes, I think I would. And if you couldn't see me? Imagine. I remember when you said we'd break up, I felt sorry. Very sorry? How can you measure sorrow? Yes, I think so. Do you love him or me more? You're different. Have you paid for your drinks? - Where are you going? To Momo's? - Yes. Right now? No, in half-an-hour. So stay here a bit. - Did you go out? - Yes. - Where? - To a restaurant. What did you talk about? I can't remember. Try. It was only yesterday. You know I have no memory, I don't know what you said 5 minutes ago. When he was speaking, did you hold hands? Yes, how did you guess? Did your knees touch under the table? Definitely not. We were side-by-side. Did he caress you too? He caressed my cheek and kissed my neck. You don't recall words, but caresses you do. I remember I didn't want to. What! You had a fight! No but he's always forcing me. Like what? If I say, you'll get cross. No, go on, I won't. He wanted me to hold his hand you know where. Yes. And? I did for a bit, then I stopped. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Go on. That's it. That's it? Oh and he got musicians to sing for me. Do you like being sung to? - I think so. - Do you or don't you? Well, do you or don't you? In restaurants, but not while I'm asleep. He bought you a plastic-wrapped rose like they sell in restaurants. Yes, how did you know? I want a pancake. I'd like a sugar pancake. Want one? After dinner, what did you do? We went to the movies. - Did you hold hands? - Yes. - Did you kiss? - Yes. - Did you make love? - Yes. You made love in a cinema! So? We were at the back, it was nearly empty. How did you make it? I climbed onto his lap. Then what? Nothing. he took me home. By car? - He doesn't have one. - Has he no money? Just now, because he's not working. Do you give him some? Sometimes. Do you give him my money? Yes, what you give me. Last night, did you pay? Yes. When he took you home, did you do it again? A bit. At the door. What's a bit? We didn't finish. Then what? I went to bed. - Thinking of him? - No. What did you think about? You. Me? I thought about you till I fell asleep. - Do you like us discussing you? - No. - Why not? - I don't know. I ask all these questions, you must find me dull? Yes. Do you ever hate me? No, but I long for you to finish. What do you feel? I don't want to reply, I want to lie to please you. Do you ever invent anything? Maybe sometimes I do. When? I said maybe. I don't know. Try to remember. I don't know. Anyway I only lie when I really have to. - When? - I don't know. When do you have to lie? I don't know. Don't you know you mustn't lie? - Why not? - Because no one will believe you. I gave you 200 francs. I saw. I haven't given you any for ages. I saw. Are you surprised? By what? That I haven't been giving you any? I thought you'd run short. I had, but you might have thought. Everyone runs short sometimes. Suppose I never give you any anymore. You did today. Why bother about the future? Suppose I give you no more. Would you still come? Didn't I when you didn't give me any? What's that spot? I made love to Momo with my clothes on. I'd love it if you and Momo could be friends. You must be out of your mind. Silly. I forgot, I've something important to say. - What? - I want to make you an offer. What offer? I want you to be my wife. - You want to marry me? - Yes. Why say so now? I think the time has come. You'd be my wife, I'd sell the flat so we could be comfortable, then we will move to a house I'll inherit. You don't know but I'm wealthy. You're wealthy? My family is wealthy. We'll have a church wedding with presents and a party. We'll honeymoon in Asia or Africa. I'd like us to have children. You're made to have two, three or more. What do you reckon? I can't say now, I have to think. Tell me tomorrow, the next day. I'll tell you sooner. In the meantime, I'll introduce you to my parents. You're right to think it over, marriage is not an easy matter. Marriage is for life, that's what I think. Hence the church wedding. Why in church? Because that way we can't ever separate. I didn't think you practised. I do, I do. I am not a believer. But you told me you went to a convent. Even then, I didn't believe. - What do you believe? - Nothing. I didn't believe because I never considered it. If someone never considers something, that thing doesn't exist. To me, religion doesn't exist. Maybe one day you will consider it. I don't think so. Religion is boring. Are you ever bored? Sometimes, yes. What do you feel? Boredom. What is this boredom? Boredom is boredom. It's much more than that. My parents are a bit conventional. What's conventional? What's left when you think about nothing. Before we see them, I'd like to reply. I want to make love. I thought you couldn't. I can now. OK but first tell me if you'll be my wife. You're the only man I could marry because I needn't hide anything from you. But I keep thinking you're hiding something. And you promise such lovely things, a party, a dress, a trip. Well? I can't marry you. Why won't you? - I won't because I won't. - Why not? Because of Momo, I don't want to lose him. - Do you want to marry him? - No, not him. Who cares about Momo? See him as much as you like. Why marry? It's all fine as it is. If you can see Momo, if nothing changes. If you become wealthy. Why refuse? What for? I don't want to, that's all. Let's make love. I don't want to. Just tell me why you won't marry me. I warn you, if we don't now we won't for a while. Why not? I didn't want to say, I thought I'd write, but it's better you know. I'm going to Corsica with Momo for two weeks. You won't marry because you're going to Corsica, well don't! He's booked the room. I don't want you to go. I want to, so why can't I? If you don't, I'll give you a present. What? Whatever you like. For instance. Money. - How much? - A lot. Have you got it? Come. Look. 6000 francs. It seems like more. I'll give you ten times that. I'm sorry, I can't. Let's make love. When I get back we'll do it even more. - You really won't? - No. Come on. See how selfless I am. Why do you say that? I could have taken the money and gone anyway. So what? So you've saved some money. No I haven't, you've lost it. If you like. Can I ask you a favour? What? You nearly gave me 60,000 francs. Lend me just 3,000. What for? Momo is out of work. We're broke. We'd have a nicer holiday. You hurt me. What for? I'm sorry. Here. is that enough? It's too much. Take it, you may need it. Thanks. - How was it? - Fine. Great or just fine? Great. Happy then? Do you love me? You know I do. Where to now? Nowhere. I'll take you home. OK? - As you please. - No, as you please. You're off tomorrow. You decide if you want to stay. - I don't care. - Why don't you? I'll see you when I get back. Are you sure? Yes. Won't you say goodbye? I want to be in your room, I want to have you there. You know you can't. I need you again.it's not your body, I just need you. Can Cecilia come out for two minutes? She is not in. Are you sure? We've just spoken. She left two minutes ago. Where did she go? Out to dinner. When's she due back? She isn't. She's off to Corsica with a girlfriend. She's staying there tonight. She's back in two weeks. What's the matter? She's gone, her father's dying. I'm alone in an empty flat. My husband went to the clinic last night, there's no hope. No hope? The doctors say he's got two or three days left. But Cecilia likes her father. She likes no one. Suck me off. Stop the car, it's more relaxing. Suck me off. - What's wrong? - Go on, please don't stop. That's not my name. I wanted to marry her, I wanted to stop loving her, - I wanted her not to exist. - I want to get out. - She has no regrets. - You'll kill us. She didn't even turn or smile. - I don't want to die. - Do you think I want to die? Like any bastard who's been dumped? Think I want it to end like this? How are we today? Fine, fine. Miss? Could you help me write a letter? Right now, I've no time. I'll look by at the end of the day. I've been having suicidal thoughts, I tried to die, really. Now I believe one mustn't die of despair but feed off one's despair. Not die of it, but live off it. Live at any price.

[Dear Shizuru:] [Thanks for the letter.] [I'm chasing you down to New York next month.] [It will be two years since we last met.] [I was really surprised to find out that your photo exhibition will be displayed in New York.] [I can't wait to go see it.] Starring: Tamaki Hiroshi Miyazaki Aoi Uh, excuse me. Where is, uh, this point? Um. It's about two blocks this way, and then you make a left. [I still remember the time I spent with you.] [In those three years we've spent our time together, how many times have I been fooled by your strange lies?] Hey, you should be careful. For what? Even when you are casually reading magazines, they can read everything that's going on in your mind. Huh? One in every five people in this world is an esper! It's true! I checked. How? It's simple. If you think someone is suspicious, you think this in your mind, without saying it out loud: "Ah! There's a spider on your shoulder!" And, if he gets startled and looks at his shoulder, he is an esper for certain! I was really surprised when I did it in a crowded place! By the way, in this university. Miyuki is without a doubt an esper! Miyuki is? Why don't you check, if you don't believe me? Sorry to keep you waiting. A-lunch again?! Only eating biscuits again? Want some? Are you going to the afternoon class? American studies? Yes! Hey, Miyuki, you are a Virgo, right? Yes. Virgo is number one in fortune today! - Spider. Virgo is number one in fortune today! Virgo is number one in fortune today! In addition, your lucky color is Prussian blue! - Spider! In addition, your lucky color is Prussian blue! In addition, your lucky color is Prussian blue! What is it? Uh, nothing. Eh? Hey! What? What? Nothing. [After two years without seeing you, the first thing I want to tell you is that.] [That forest still exists today.] [Where we chased those unknown birds,] [while biting our doughnut biscuits, that forest where we took pictures.] [That forest where we first met,] [is still.] Translated by: 8thSin at D-addicts.com Tada, Kimi wo Aishiteru [Just, loving you] International title: "Heavenly Forest" . . Translated by: 8thSin at D-addicts.com Translated by: 8thSin at D-addicts.com By deciding to attend Meikei University, I would like every one of you to seriously consider what you can learn from this university, and what you will be learning. [Six years ago, I didn't attend my university's entrance ceremony.] [[Private property No Trespassers]] Hey there. There's a traffic light ahead with a crosswalk button. I think it's better idea to cross from there. Oh. The students always make them wait forever up there, so the drivers never stop here. Even though it's a pedestrian crossing? Well, yes. Are you a senior? Huh? I'm attending that university starting today. I'm a freshman too. I tried to cross from here on the day of my entrance exam, and gave up. Then we are both late for the entrance ceremony! Well, I wasn't planning to attend the entrance ceremony in the first place. - Why? Well, I wasn't planning to attend the entrance ceremony in the first place. Well, I kind of dislike crowded places. Anyway, you should cross from over there. Good bye. Don't mind me. I just want to check something. Whether or not, there is a kind person who would still stop for me. Putin. After Vladimir Putin assumed the president's office, US president Clinton, who had a close relationship with former president Yeltsin had. However, president Clinton is facing an election next year. His time left in the office is limited. However, whether the next government is lead by Al Gore or George Bush, US government policies will. International Affairs course is going to be my fourth period class for sure! Hey! I was just making an important announcement about international affairs! It itches! I'm exausted! I feel so sleepy. Something stinks! You farted, didn't you? No, dude! Not that kind of stink, I mean it stinks like medicine. Oh! It's probably that factory across the street. I heard it smells even worse during summer. Smell? Is there medicine for me, that doesn't smell as much? Did your medicine smell? Hmm? There's no smell. Sure there is! You've been using it since you were a child. It's just your imagination! What? [I was always hopelessly distracted by this smell.] Maybe they are making poison! How's that even possible?! [And so, I distanced myself from other people in my life.] Is this seat taken? Eh? Well, yes. Why did you take my picture at the pedestrian crossing? You noticed? Usually people would. Well, somewhat. What do you mean by "somewhat"? Somewhat. What department are you in? English Department. I'm Satonaka Shizuru, of French Department. I'm Segawa Makoto. I have chronic rhinitis. What? My sense of smell is only about 1/100 of an average person. Really. I see. Right. Did you make any friends? No, not really. Me neither. At this age, it's not easy making new friends, huh? That's all you are eating for lunch? Yes. Want some? No, thanks. But it's delicious. Doughnut biscuits, my staple food. Biscuits are? Yes. Wheat gives out wonderful aroma, and there's a hole in the middle! Then, why don't WE become friends? What? Can't we? I don't get how it got to "Then". I guess it's impossible for a man and a woman to become friends. Why did you just take a peek at me? What? Um. You just thought in your mind: "I don't think of you as a woman", didn't you!? - I didn't look! You just thought in your mind: "I don't think of you as a woman", didn't you!? By the way, What? Did you get across the predestrian crossing? I didn't. It seems there aren't many Good Samaritans. But I'm going to cross it no matter what, before I graduate. I mean it's wrong! A pedestrian walk that no one can cross? Only a soccer referees on a baseball field can cross something like that. You can cross it. It's actually quite easy. What? I know how to cross that pedestrian crossing. How? Wow! I can cross it as many times as I want! Hey. Incredible! Well then, I'll get going. Huh? Bye. All right. You there! Eh? It says "No Trespassers". It does, but. Why are you going in? Photography. It's my hobby. Really. What are you doing? There's plenty of time left until my class. Yes, but. Ah! Ah! Look! Hey, wait! There it is! Are you sure it's that way? I heard it. Really? Where? Probably that way. How cute! Oh. There we go. Will birds actually eat something like this? Sure they will! It's tastiest food in the world! Bit more to the right. That way. Right? Okay. Hey. Huh? What? Have you ever had a kiss with someone before, Makoto? Huh? Do you? Yes I do. Really? How did it feel? How.? Did it feel like something sweet? Well, yes. Like something melting? Well, I guess it melted. You've never done it before, have you? Sure I have! Many times! Okay, I'm finished. Was I heavy? No, I'm actually surprised because you were so light! You really eat nothing but doughnut biscuits, huh? But I'm getting enough nutrition. What I lack is growth hormone. Huh? There are crumbles of biscuits on your hair. Oh, it's okay. See? Isn't it great? Yes. Delicious! Here. Just one is enough. Okay, one more. Segawa. Ah! Why don't you join us at that table? What? How can you enjoy the food by yourself? We are all in the same class anyway. If you would like. Thanks. Right. He's here. Oh! Oh. Hello. Why don't you sit down? Go ahead. Okay. Are you okay, dude? But what a surprise. You can talk! What? Well, how many month has it been since we came here? I've never seen you talking with anyone. Well, some people are like that. Are you that type of person? No, I don't really dislike talking with other people. So you like talking? I have just been a bit shy until now. You sure have been shy for a long time! Well, let's have a toast in celebration of our new buddy. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! What's the point if you didn't join us? Cheers. Nice to meet ya. Sekiguchi, catch. Got it! Saki, here. [Now that I think of it, maybe people really are espers.] [Even if they don't say it out loud, we can decipher their true feelings.] [He likes her.] [He likes her too.] [It seems, she likes him.] [I'm sure Shizuru can read other people's mind too,] [so I'm sure this is when she realized.] [That ever since we entered this university.] [. I was in love with Miyuki.] Wow, it's beautiful! It feels great! See? I told you it's a great place! Women always take so much time for things like this. True. It's so hot, we should jump in without them. What? Don't you think? Yes, right. Hey, what's that? Oh, I scratched it up a little bit. What? Not scratched by someone? No. Come on, show me! No! Why? I bet there are 10 nail marks left by a girl under that bandage! - Sorry to keep you waiting. Why? I bet there are 10 nail marks left by a girl under that bandage! See? I told you they would be lost in love. We are not "lost in love"! Right? Dude! Pull yourself together. Got it! Come on! Miyuki, a bit closer to the middle. It will take the picture in about five seconds. It's starting. 3, 2, 1. Yay! You are staring too eagerly! Your breasts are so small! Shut up! You guy should've come too! We didn't feel like it, we are not kids. What, kids? I'm an adult too! I took this one. Wouldn't your girlfriend be angry when she finds out about this? .Huh? Girlfriend? What? You have a girlfriend? No I don't. Really? I saw you walking with a girl before. With who? I think it was the girl in the French Department. No, she's not my girlfriend. Just a friend. Really? Who? Who is it? You know her too. You know, in International Affairs class. Remember that girl who always sleeps behind us? Oh, her! You are going out with someone like her? Who is it? Remember? She's got really messed up hair, always wiping her nose! To summarize. A weirdo! Weirdo, weirdo! That's harsh! A normal person won't go out with her. - I'm telling you, she's just a friend. A normal person won't go out with her. Don't be shy! Everyone have different tastes. Hey! That's not how it is! I'm not discriminating, it's just a matter of preference. No, no. A girl who fits your description is standing right behind you. What? Look! You hurt her feelings. I didn't know she was standing behind me. You think you are allowed to say bad things about her just because you didn't know? I didn't say bad things about her! You just called her a weirdo! I was just going with the flow. So you wouldn't have said it by yourself? I was just going with the flow. I just remembered I had to do something. I have to go. Okay. Later. Why did you say that for? I told you! You were being too harsh! What is it? I'm sorry. For what? They didn't have any bad intentions. They are always like that, just making fun of me. I don't really mind. Really? Then I'm relieved. Do you really believe that? Then you really are an insentive fool! I don't mind them calling me weird at all. I'm already used to it. It's you who made me sad. "She's just a friend, she's just a friend", as if you are making an excuse. I'm not at all happy to have such a friend! I'm sorry. If you really are a friend, you could've defended me a little. Yes. You could've said "She's not a weirdo." "She's just a bit more 'original' than other people!" Hey there. This. Here. I found it in a souvenir shop by the countryside. For me? Yes, I hope you like it. After I eat this, I'm going to cry. Huh? I was trying my best not to, but I'm going to cry. Why? I will cry for sure! Will you cry out loud? Then, I'll take it back. No! Why? Crank the shutter twice. Did you change the aperture? Yes I did. Number 4. What the? Oh! Try one more time. One more time. What? What's wrong? That was painful. Why? Well, we are holding our breaths. What? What? What? What is it? That house. Wow! Rent here is a lot cheaper than a condo near the train station. I see. Sit down. Okay. Want something to drink? Yes. Hey, what's this? Ah!! Don't touch these without permission. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't have to hide them in such a hurry. It's not like that. You are a boy, you need to use things like that. What are you confusing them with? Don't worry about it. The darkroom is over there. Right. You will be doing this in pitch-dark. Okay. Are your eyes really closed? Yes they are. Ah! Hold on! What? It's not rolling on! See? You are right. Pull it out. Take out the photographic paper. Okay. Put this in the developer liquids. Put it in. Gently. Gently. Right. That's fine. Now soak it through. Soak it through. All of it. All of it. Wow, amazing! Hey, what do I do after this? Huh? Oh, pick it up from the corner. Sorry, it's getting late! Don't worry, the trains are still running. I always forget the time passing when I'm developing photographs. Yeah, it was so much fun, time just blew by! Wait here for a minute. I'll walk you to the station after I get the last one developed. - Okay. I'll walk you to the station after I get the last one developed. Ah! You made me so happy today. Huh? That picture. You taught me how to develop the pictures too. Oh, that. Come again anytime. I can? It's a lot faster than taking it out to photo labs. I'm really going to come! I'll come for sure! Sure. Eventually, I'll become a woman who you can't wait to take picture of! What do you mean? I'm going to become a woman who will fill your room with her picture! What are you talking about? Oh, but not yet. Wait a little while longer. At least until I can take off these glasses. Your eyeglasses? Yes, the doctor told me I can take these glasses off when I'm grown up, and my vision gets better. What? I told you before, right? What I lack, is growth hormone. Will you really grow up? Yes I will! My breast will get bigger, and my hip will be round too, and even my teeth will grow again. Really? I still have baby tooth in the back. What?! Really? But don't worry! From now, I will grow up, become unbelievably beautiful, and become a woman loved by everyone! What would you do, if I became incredible?! Incredible? What is? You know, everything! Here and there, this and that! Really. I'm going to become an adult woman, wear a REALLY revealing dress, and get into a sexy pose right in front of you! When I take my glasses off, is when you will be truly astonished! Got it? I wonder if it will be. Wait a minute! Are you trying to imagine it, but can't? Don't worry. I mean. What do you mean by "Don't worry"? Nothing. What do you mean by "Don't worry"?! You are already an university student! It's just the beginning for me! A university student, but! It's just the beginning for me. Impossible. Not impossible! - Impossible. - Not impossible! The means of transportation for weapons of mass destruction, the missiles are. [Lately, I wanted to be with her all the time,] [so I stopped applying my medicine.] It stinks. Someone close the windows. It really smells bad, doesn't it? Poison gas factory? Yes. That thing is a big help for me though. What? Nothing. What are you reading? Is it interesting? It's very interesting. Really. I will become a bride one day too. I'm sure you will become a beautiful bride. Thank you. It's nothing. What about you, Segawa? You never think about getting married? I don't! It's not even close for me. But you will one day, right? I wonder if I will. I don't think I'll ever get married. Why? Just a feeling. That's such a waste! You really think so? Not for you. For someone who is supposed to be with you. Oh. You hold happiness for another person in your hands. Somewhere in this world, a girl is waiting to receive that happiness. So you have to make sure that girl gets the happiness you hold. Are you okay? Yes. It's pretty hard to walk here. But this isn't that bad. Sorry, did we make you wait? Hello. Hello. Miyuki really wanted to come when I told her about this place. It's a really comfortable place! Isn't it? Just ahead, there's a. Hmm? Sorry, can you wait here for a while? Sure. What's wrong? Yes, she is beautiful. Really beautiful. In addition, she knows she's beautiful. But I'm not saying that's a bad thing. That's why people from both sexes like her, old people and kids like her, I'm sure puppies love her too! She really is a perfect woman! What's wrong? I'm saying she's the complete opposite of me! Why did you bring her here? What? Wasn't this OUR place? Wasn't this an important place just for the two of us? The US government and. Do you mind if I sit here? Go ahead. Thank you. Uh. Um, I'm sorry for yesteday. Excuse me. Ah! Amethyst! What? Do you have an Amethyst yourself? -No. Do you have an Amethyst yourself? I heard this is a gem that will make people love you. Wow! Isn't it cute? It's beautiful! Isn't it beautiful? Ah! Is that rose quartz? Right! These are both gems of love, right? It's cute! It's heart-shaped. That's right. Heart-shaped. What are you doing? Oh! Not "Oh"! Segawa, these are gems of love. Right. Okay. Can I talk to you for a second? What are you doing? What? Stop playing around, why are you with Miyuki? We became friends somehow. Weren't you angry at her yesterday? I wasn't particularly angry at her. That's true, but. Are you up to something? I'm not up to anything. No way! No way? Yes. I just want to. Love the person I love loves. [She tried to love the person I loved."] [Such complex relationship lasted until the fall of our Junior year.] Spider! Spider. What is it? Uh, nothing. Hey! What? What? Nothing. So? What did you decide to do? Uh, well. Is Sekiguchi in the seminar? Shirahama and Yuuka are in internship, and Saki is in the Berlitz program, not the scheduled lecture. I see. They all began to prepare for the job hunting. That's right. What about you, Segawa? Well. Why don't you take pictures for rest of your life, rather than finding a job? How am I supposed to make a living doing that? Eat grass or something. Miyuki, you've already found a career, right? I'm sorry for you guys, I'm using my father's connections. Was it foreign company? Right. In addition, I'll be working overseas. I basically picked it just for that. You are pretty oldfashioned, despite your appearance. Sorry. I see. You are going overseas when you graduate. We are going to miss you. We are going to miss you. Wait a minute? What about you? You haven't decided what to do either, right? [[Job guide's search]] This, this, and this. What are you doing? You startled me! It's just you, Makoto! What's all this baggage for? You know. What's that? I ran away from home. Ran away from home? Not a 'petit' one, a 'big' long one! So I wanted them to let me use an empty room. In the university? Yes. What? Nothing. I went to the real estate office too, But they treated my like a child, and wouldn't rent me a room! Of course. What do you mean by "Of course"? Sorry. I found a target this evening. Hiking club's office. They already split up, so no one uses it, right? I'm going to borrow the football team's large showers too. Why don't you just come to my house? What? [I didn't know why I was saying something like that.] You used to come often, remember? ["Why don't you come to my house?", ha!] You should've just asked me from the start. You are okay with that? It's been so long! You stopped coming for some reason. Because Miyuki wouldn't have liked it. But it hasn't changed at all! Well, there's really no reason for me to change it. Hey, what about the darkroom? It's still there. So it's still there! Wanna do it? Should we? When did you take that picture?! Recently. I think I like these more than landscape. I see. That's why, I've been taking nothing but pictures of people. Hmm? I'm finished with the bath. Okay. Are you going in right now? Uh, no. Hey, Hmm? Are you sick? That's not nice! Huh? Medicine for girls. Don't be looking through them without permission. (She is implying something like birth control pills by "Medicine for girls".) (She is implying something like birth control pills by "Medicine for girls".) Sorry. [She used to lie very often.] It seems we are a couple on medicine. What? Never mind. Let's sleep. You can use the bed, I'll use. Huh? It's my first time. Please be gentle. Wait, wait! It's fine. I have no money. I'm already prepared to pay with my body. No. I don't mind. If you use that greasy stuff. Wait, hold on! I didn't bring you here with such intentions. Absolutely none. Just, as a friend. Is it because I haven't grown up at all? No that's not how it is. Because my breasts didn't get any bigger? No. What now? I'm sleeping right here. You can use the bed. I'm sleeping right here! I don't care if you regret it later. What? I will grow up, and you will wonder: "Why didn't I sleep with such a wonderful woman?" Good night. Good night. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot. I'm going to go on ahead. Why? Let's go together. I'm going ahead. Are you still upset? No. What if someone sees us together here? Going to class together, that's. You already gave me a place to stay. I don't want to give you any more trouble by getting in the way of your love life. Bye! You walk too slowly. Why are you following me? It's because you walk too slowly! Then, why don't you just go on ahead? Well, I can't do that, I would feel sorry for you. Shizuru! Morning! Good morning. Morning. Morning. You can cook? I made it all the time at home. Really. I was taking care of my little brother too. You have a brother? Just one little brother. He already passed away though. What?! A week ago. He was in bed for a long time because of a disease. You ran away from home because. Yes. I was discouraged by it, I mean. It became awkward for me to stay home, and I had a fight with my dad. Then I just ran out! What's the name of your little brother's illness? People with this disease die when they fall in love. What!? People with this disease die when they fall in love. Just kidding, a genetic one. Oh. My mom passed away in the same disease. What? It was when I was still small. So, me and my father are the only survivors. Do you know what this means? In other words, I inherited my father's genes, and became an unfeminine woman like this. Even my hair is rough like steel wires! Shall we eat? Yes. Here you go. You can drink alcohol? Probably. Cheers. Cheers. Let's eat! Let's eat! It's delicious. Isn't it? It really tastes great. Right? Right? I'm really proud of my cooking skill! What is it? Nothing, it's just that I have never seen you eat anything other than doughnut biscuits. I do eat other things! Don't stare at me like that! But I want to. I'm going to eat a lot, and grow up a lot too! Okay. My breasts are going to be this big, and. Wear a really revealing dress, right? What? You are already 21. I will! I will grow up! Sure, sure. I don't care if you regret it later! You will say to yourself: "I should've slept with her back then!" Sure, sure. Makoto, you idiot! Are these onions? Aren't they cute? Yes. They are tiny. Use of abortion pills RU488 was first approved 1988 in France, followed by. Reading this again? Don't you ever get bored of it? No. By the way, did you know? What? That today is my birthday. Ah! Sorry, I completely forgot! As I thought. Sorry. I'm really sorry. If you feel that bad about it, there's somewhere I want you to accompany me with. Did something good happen? Just a little. It has to do with Miyuki anyway, right? Well, it doesn't matter to me. Anyway, what do you think about photography? What you mean? Do you want to continue it for rest of your life? For example, as a career? What? I'm thinking of becoming a photographer. I'm sure it will take many years from now, but. That's what I thought after seeing your pictures. Mine? Yes. That I can't have you beating me forever. So as a test of my skill, I want to take part in a photography competition. Why don't you apply too? I will if you will! Then let's plan for the competition later. A strategy meeting! Yes. We have to take photos for the competition too. Sounds fun! Where should we take them? I think we should go somewhere farther than usual. Travel around for a bit, and find our themes. It's starting to sound more and more interesting! When should we go? Let's see. How about this Sunday? Uh, this Sunday is. Why? Let's go! I. Have plans with Miyuki. It can't be helped! I promised Miyuki first. You are the devil, Makoto. You make people really happy, then send them straight down to the bottom of Hell. "Bottom of Hell"? Is it a date? No, you know, that. Wedding convention or something? Just accompanying her for that. Oh, Miyuki was telling me she wanted to go there. She's oldfashioned despite her appearance, right? So she chose you after all! Hmm? Fine! Go! In that very moment, my lost love will be confirmed. That very moment, when you picked Miyuki over me. You don't have to. What about your clothes? Huh? What are you going to wear? The usual. Don't you have a suit or something? I don't. Then go buy it tomorrow. Just for that? Of course! It's a wedding convention. Miyuki is going to see her dream! How can she have a battered down boy like you standing next to her? Oh. And, let's see. What about money? Money? Oh. Right, I'll make a withdraw from the bank. You have to be ready. Right, even a loser can dress for success. Shut up! I'm going to use the restroom. You are that nervous? Shut up. Hold on! Wait, stop! Your shoes! Wait, your shoes. Get going! Okay. Be careful! Excuse me, I have to use the restroom. [Shizuru put.] Ah! It was wonderful! Wasn't it? Segawa. Eh? Oh, yes. What's the line for? They take pictures for you. What pictures? A souvenir photo wearing one of the dresses from the show. Really? Let's go home. Thank you very much for accompanying me for today. You don't want to get the photo? It probably takes a lot of time. But you are smiling again. But you are not smiling. Your mind is somewhere else. Well, that is. It seems you want to go home as soon as possible. Someone waiting for you in home? No one's waiting for me! That was a joke. But it really doesn't matter. I'm already satisfied. Wait. Okay, we will take the picture now. Why don't you hold hands? Huh? Uh, um. What? Never mind, it's nothing. Does it hurt? Not at all. Then you don't have to cry. But. Which tooth came off? The one in far right. Which one? No! I'm not showing to you! Where's the tooth that came off? Here. You really had a baby tooth! I told you! I'm still growing up. Don't touch! Shizuru. Are you asleep? Close to. You? Close to. Then, do your best to sleep. When's your birthday, Shizuru? Why? We should celebrate your birthday too. Are you planning to make me happy, then send me down to Hell? That's not what I. Don't worry about celebrating for me. Right now, you should only think about Miyuki. You should only think about fulfilling your love for Miyuki. To be in relationship isn't the only way to be in love. What? One-sided love is. In its own way, a complete love. Either way, Miyuki will be going overseas when she graduates. There's no reason to break our existing relationship to. A coward's reasoning. I'm going to sleep. Then, give me a present too. What? A birthday present. Sure. What do you want? A kiss. Kiss me. Is there anything else you want? If you kissed me, I might die from happiness! What are you talking about? Did you kiss Miyuki already? I did. At least five times. Then do it with me too. With you too. I was thinking of "Lovers" for my photo's theme. "Lovers kissing". I want you to be in my self-portrait with me. For the competition? Right. As a model for a photograph? That's right. When's your birthday? I'll make it tomorrow! Tomorrow?! Few steps forward. Forward? A bit more. A bit more. Ah. Just a little bit more. Okay! Here. Are you sure? Sure, it's just a kiss. As a birthday present? As a model, right? Good morning. Good morning. Ah! Hold on. Huh? You can take them off? Yes. I can almost see clearly now. What is it? Uh. Is it just me, or are you taller than when we first met? You just realized it now? You really were growing up. Yes, my breasts are incredible too! Wanna see? Uh, no. That's okay. Should we get going soon? I'll stay here just a while longer. Oh. Yes. You can go now. You are going to your class, right? Yes. It's a party tonight. What? A party for the completion of your photo. I'll make dinner tonight. Even if I made every dish on my menu. There would only be like three dishes though! See you later. Hey, Makoto. Yeah? Was there at least a tiny bit of love in that kiss? Eh!? Never mind. Bye. Bye. In two suicide terror attacks on September 19th of 2002, where 7 civilians were victimized in Israel. [[Good bye. Thank you for everything.]] I know you are a student here, but we can't tell you her address. You don't have to tell me. Please just check whether or not she went back home. Hey, wasn't Satonaka the name of that girl this evening? Oh, Right! What is it? That girl. Came to give us the notice of withdrawal this evening. What? Voluntary withdrawl. I told her it's a waste because it's so close to graduation. I'm sorry for coming so late at night. My name is Segawa. Is Shizuru back home? Excuse me! [That was.] [My very first kiss, and I thought it was the beginning of everything.] [But.] [If only I had taken the first step earlier.] [I had taken peaceful and relaxing days I spent with Shizuru for granted.] [Never have I even imagined there would be an end to those days.] Shizuru. How much farther until we reach the hospital? There's an emergency hospital on the other side of the bridge. Are you okay? This idiot is ridiculously light. Let me down. Oh! He regained his consciousness! Let me down! Can't do that. We are almost there. We are too close. If we get so close, my smell would. Huh? I stink of medicine. What's he talking about? Must be the fever talking. I stink of medicine! Not even once have you smelled before! Always smelled like shampoo, like a girl! That's right! Pull yourself together, Segawa! Pull yourself together! We are almost there. Hold on tight! Are you okay? Don't give up! Hang on! Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? We have to have a toast first! Oh, right. Well let's just. Celebrate the fact that this idiot's life is saved! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Please be quiet. But I'm so relieved! I heard it was really serious! Sorry for the trouble. Thanks. Right, give me gratitude for rest of your life. Acting all big. I'll give you an update for things that happened while you were resting. Okay. First of all, we have all found a job after graduation! Really?! Shirahara will become an employee for the UN. Yuuka is in Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sekiguchi is in a movie distribution company, and Saki is in a international brokerage firm. I see. Congratulations! You guys are amazing. You are all going overseas when you graduate. Of course! Why do you think we are in English Department for? Acting big again. Yeah. One more thing. About Shizuru. We all helped with the search, but. We can't even find a trace of her. I see. I'm sorry. Don't be. But it was a surprise. The ultimate beginners at romance were secretly living together. Living together, it's. Weren't you living together? Yes. What's wrong with that? That's how love is. The more you hide it from other people, the more excited you get! Right? You were getting excited? No way! Please be quiet! Bye bye! Bye. Living together, huh? Sorry. But for some reason, I still feel like I haven't gotten over you. What? Well, I guess I never really confessed my love, so it's no surprise. I intend to wait for Shizuru's return in that house. I don't know how long I will end up waiting, but. Okay, now I'm completely over you. Segawa, can I ask you just one more thing? What is it? The first time I spoke to you, Segawa, Ah! Why don't you join us in that table? You liked me back then, right? How did you know? As I thought~ Really? I see. [And so, each one of them departed towards the place they belong.] [As if. I was the only one left behind.] [I graduated from university, and became a photographer.] [[Satonaka Shizuru]] Segawa. Miyuki! Sorry to keep you waiting. Is rose tea okay? Yes. I remember you don't drink coffee. Thank you. So, why are you. Hold on, I'll explain everything. Where's Shizuru? It was around half a year ago. I just happened to bump into her in Chinatown. But she changed a lot since we knew her. I didn't recognize her at first. It seems she recognized me right away though. She had that wide smile. And that smile was really nostalgic. That's how I finally recognized her. Anyway, she told me she was staying in the office there, so I asked her, why don't you become my roommate in this apartment? Half a year ago? Yes. You should've told me right away. Shizuru only sent me the letter last month. There were certain circumstances. What circumstances? It was cold outside, wasn't it? I'm sorry I was late. It doesn't matter. Anyway, where's Shizuru? I'm so sorry, Segawa! Huh? Actually. Shizuru is in LA for work. What? She was really looking forward to meeting you again, but. She had an unforseen photo session that she couldn't get out of. That's why, you can't see Shizuru this time. I'm so sorry! It's not something you should apologize for. I see. I see. I can't blame her if it's work. Besides, I can come again anytime. Compared to the time when I didn't even know where she was. I guess there's no hurry. Use Shizuru's room tonight. Shizuru instructed me to tell you that. I'll guide you to her photo exhibition. Thank you. Is she doing well? Yes she is. I'm sure you will be surprised when you see her. Shizuru has changed a lot. That's what she wrote in the letter. She's an adult woman in everyone's eyes. Really? I can't even imagine. [Sleep well? Use this key.] [Shizuru's exhibition starts tomorrow, so just relax for today.] [I'll leave a message in the answering machine if something comes up.] [Please leave your message after the tone.] [It's Satonaka.] [Thank you for your letter of greeting.] [Memorial service on 49th Day has ended smoothly.] (In Buddhism, it is believed that a person's soul reincarnates on 49th Day. A memorial service is held to celebrate their safe journey into the next life.) (In Buddhism, it is believed that a person's soul reincarnates on 49th Day. A memorial service is held to celebrate their safe journey into the next life.) [Shizuru's bones have been safely buried in the family grave.] (In Buddhism, it is believed that a person's soul reincarnates on 49th Day. A memorial service is held to celebrate their safe journey into the next life.) [Ms. Toyama, you have done so much for us to the very end.] [Thank you so much.] [Please stop by and visit my home when you come back to Japan.] [Good bye.] I'm back. Segawa, are you back yet? Segawa! Segawa? I'm coming in. What are you doing in the dark? Where did Shizuru go? I told you she went to LA for work. Enough with the act. There was a phone call From Shizuru's father. That Shizuru Is already dead. It's not true, right? Miyuki! Last month. That's a lie! How can she die? Shizuru was sick. A very rare disease, not very well known. She inherited her mother's genes. That disease existed in her ever since she was born. When Shizuru matures, that disease will mature together. Shizuru lived her life, being careful not to grow up. But then, Segawa. Shizuru met you, fell in love, and because she wanted to be loved by you the same way. She died Because she fell in love? In a way. Then. She died because of me? No! Shizuru chose this for herself. Even if the illness developed, she wanted to fall in love, become an adult, and live out her life. She also told me not to let you know about the disease. "Because Shizuru inside Segawa is not yet dead." "Even if it's a lie, I want to continue living inside Segawa." Shizuru's letters. There are tens of them left. She planned to keep sending them to you. Shizuru was writing them on her bed. She seemed to be having fun. It seemed. Like she was having a lot of fun. Hi, please. Thank you. [Dear Makoto:] [How are you? It's been two years.] [Were you surprised by the sudden letter?] [First of all, I want to apologize for disappearing without thanking you for everything you have done for me.] [On that day you kissed me,] [I suddenly felt embarassed.] [Not by the kiss,] [at the fact that I was all talk, and didn't mature at all.] [That's why, I decided to take a little adventure.] [I call it, "Journey of Independence".] [Just depending on my camera, that you taught me how to use.] [I came to New York by myself.] [It was a good thing that I had the courage to come, but] [I didn't have a destination,] [I just wandered around for days.] [Until I was hired by my current photo agency.] [It's pretty famous over here,] [An independent agency of a photographer, MG Studio] [And you know, I was working as an assistant for this independent photographer,] [and I was taking my own pictures at the same time.] [One thing lead to another, and it turns out they will be having an exhibition of my photographs.] [I really want you to see my exhibition.] [My very first exhibition,] [and the sight of me, who has grown so much in these two years.] [I'm sure you will be astonished when you see me now.] [Because as I declared to you earlier, I became a wonderful woman.] [I'm sure you will regret it.] ["I should've went out with her back then," you will say.] [But the truth is, things like that aren't important.] [Right now, I just want to see you.] [I want to see you, and if it's possible, I want you to praise me.] [I want you to tell me: "You worked hard," "Good job."] [With a kind voice, just like back when.] Hey. [With a kind voice, just like back when.] There's a traffic light ahead with a crosswalk button. I think it's better to cross from there. ["You can't cross here, so you should cross ahead."] [I fell in love with you at that very moment, you know.] [I started to love you more than anyone else in the world, you know.] [[The only kiss in my lifetime, the one and only love I ever had.]] [Hey, Makoto.] [Was there at least a tiny bit of love in that kiss?] [There was.] [It wasn't even close to a tiny bit.] [You were.] Thank you. [You were.] [My everything.] I'm. I'm glad I was born as myself. I'm glad I'm born as me, not anybody else. It's just that I have never seen you eat anything other than doughnut biscuits. I do eat other things! From now, I will grow up, become unbelievably beautiful, and become a woman loved by everyone! People with this disease die when they fall in love. If you kissed me, I might die from happiness! Are you finished? Yes. I've seen enough. I'm going back in the afternoon flight. I see. Segawa. Do you remember what I said to you in the past? That "you hold happiness for another person in your hands." Shizuru really received that happiness. Can you send me the rest of her letters? Sure. I'll be waiting for them with anticipation. [She used to lie very often.] [I want to be fooled by her lies for just a while longer.] [[[If you liked this movie, please look forward to our hardsub release of "Ima, Ai ni Yukimasu" (2004) [I'm coming right now, to Be With You] International Title: "Be With You", based on a novel by the same author, Ichikawa Takuji.]]] Excuse me, I'm Segawa.

Turn down that thing, will ya? You're gonna wake Scotty. - What's that? - The RCA. - Scotty's got school tomorrow. - All right. Say, you haven't seen my glasses, have you? On the table next to the clock. Yes, you're such a pretty girl, aren't you? - No, they're not here. - Try the washroom. What's gotten into Jack? Anderson's bitch must be in heat again. I'll go run her up the road. What is it, Jack? That old bitch doggin' you again? Lulu, is that you out there? You go on home, now, you hear? Go on. Get. What the devil? Still dead? I don't understand it. County ran a new wire just last month. You can drive him into town in the mornin'. He looks like he could use a good night's rest anyway. You get anything more out of him? No. He just keeps saying he's lost. Scotty, what are you doing down here? You don't know this here boy, do you, son? - Hush. - I'll put him in the barn. Come on. Come on. You get out. Why don't we go upstairs and run you a bath? Didn't your mama think to give you a haircut? Now, what is this? My God. Who'd do such a thing to a boy? They're supposed to be asleep. You always know they're supposed to be asleep. Somebody else in this house beside that baby? Somebody else in this house? Boy, I am your father. and you answer your father. Is there somebody else in this house? Is this one as smart as the other one? Afraid so. How come they're all named Betty? Well, now, that is a good Question. Maybe they're not as smart as we think. Here. Stick with the jukebox. My bird's fryin' her ass out there in the hot sun, Theodore. Yeah, well, County Health's gonna fry my ass if I put her back inside. - I serve food here, Arlis. - So to speak. And by the way, some 14-year-old kid. bought a pack of cigarettes out of your machine there. and his parents are threatening to sue me. - You want me to take it out? - Hell, no. I'm just tellin' you what I'm up against. Your mangy chicken's the least of my problems. You should have heard the stink over the rubbers last week. Do we have to have a prophylactic machine in the ladies' toilet? We are doing 2-to-1 compared to the men's room. I know, Arlis, but this ain't Abilene. We're a small town. We got small-town values. - Am I right, Cindy? - Amen. Like I said, you just missed him. We were preparing to close the casket. Well, it's probably best. I was sort of the black sheep of the family. Well, as they say, "In death, all is forgiven." That's a nice sentiment. I'll have to remember that. Exactly what relation are you? It's complicated. Would you mind giving us a moment alone? Of course. The book is here if you care to sign. Thank you. God bless, whoever you are. You know, my face breaks out about two days after you leave town. Every time, like some goddamn teenaged girl. - It's the chocolate. - I know. I just can't help myself. How come you don't have those cheese and peanut butter crackers anymore? They pick up pinworms in the heat. Pinworms? Jesus. Too bad. My kids love those things. You want a carton of Kools for Nathan? No. He's Quit. Again. Jesus. I never get used to these chickens. - About twenty-five. - Twenty. Twenty-five late? Lay it down. You heard about Lou Jamison? I heard his widow was lookin' to unload his machines. Was. Pudge Riley got to her Friday last. He get the Remingtons? Two dozen electro-slots. Says he's got a buyer for 'em in Oklahoma. All I know is Lou Jamison's widow is sittin'. on all the Texaco stations in Benson County. and most of the Dairy Queens, with no machines. I don't want Benson County. But Arlis, I had to drive through Benson to get here. - Why not expand a little? - I'm big enough. - I don't need Benson. - But Arlis. Just make a note about the machines, Elliot. Say, Arlis, I almost forgot. There was a fella askin' about you over in Woodlake. - Denny Harris? - No. Just some fella. Said he knew you from way back. I figured he must've worked for you sometime. - Why is that? - He had one of our dimes. You know, the blue juke dimes? - You get a name? - He didn't offer. I didn't ask. Said he wanted to look you up. Anyway, I stayed vague. You did right. I'll see you on the 7th. Looks like I'm gonna be stretchin' felt in the mornin'. You're gonna be stretchin' your luck if you're thinkin' about take-out. anytime soon. It is a slight feverish tonight. Just wait till that damn cake pops its lid. Unless that little pastry inside comes with a bicycle pump. and two sisters, there ain't gonna be a farm animal safe tonight. Go! Go! Go! Go! Three, two, one! Christ Almighty. Just put her in my pickup. - Lookin' good. - Here's to ya, honey! Feel like knockin' a few sins off your ledger, Arlis? You want me to find out if she's got a home. And take her there. What's the damage? Well, put it this way. Feed this girl a cucumber, it'd come out pickles. Jesus. I figure the bed's one of those vibratin' numbers. so that explains the Quarters. Nobody could possibly fancy pretzel twists that much. so I figured you won some kind of weird contest. As for the condoms, well, either you got a yen. for cheerleading squads, or we had the night of all nights. Whatever. There's an explanation. As for the blue chicken, I need a little help with that one. - You passed out. - Who wouldn't? The coins just need to be papered for the bank. The condoms and the twists are inventory. The chicken's Brainy Betty. I take it Betty's one of the exotics? She plays tic-tac-toe. What makes her so brainy? She wins nine times out of ten. You want some coffee? You got a machine for that too? Half a dozen in the next three counties. But given the circumstances of your immediate past. I would suggest the real bean. You wouldn't happen to have a pair of chinos and a belt, would ya? "Boo-boo"? Story of my life. Wait. Don't forget Lorraine. Peek's Beauty Academy, right outside Red Grove. near Green Gene's Pickle Factory. Buy a burger around here, chances are it's Green Gene's under the bun. Anyway. seein' as the beauty academy was next door to the pickle factory. we always had plenty of people to practice on. So one day I'm doin' this tint job on this lady. and my instructor comes over and is giving me. The collar picked up a little perfume. so if you got a suspicious wife, I'd run some soap through it. I don't need to worry about that. Headin' home? I don't think so. I got a girlfriend up in Bayview. That oughta be enough for now. - You got a coat? - Yeah. - Money? - Sure. Well, thanks for the eggs. Everything. Thanks for the company. It must get lonely on the road sometimes. Like anything else, you're born to it. Well, you're a born listener, that's for sure. Depends on who's talkin'. - What's your name? - Kay. All right, Kay. You girls watch yourselves. - You're sure this is no trouble? - No use you waitin' seven hours. on a bus to Bayview when I can get you there in two. I just hate to take ya too far off the beaten path. There's a man I can see on the way, if you don't mind a detour or two. - It's greased. - Huh? The wristband. By the way, I get those novelties straight from Korea. I can do you ten on the dollar, as many as you want. Bayview's a little south for you, ain't it, Arlis? Who said anything about Bayview? '55, '56, somewhere in there. Eisenhower days. - '57. - Whatever. - How'd you know about Bayview? - Reese Davies. - Who's Reese Davies? - A moron. Used to own a movie theater down that way. At least, his father did, till he died. Reese ran it into the ground in about 18 months. I had a couple of cigarette machines in the lobby from his old man's day. Then when the theater went south, Reese tried to claim 'em as assets. It's his wife. Reese's. Ugly as sin, ain't it? Maybe some music'll take the bite out of it. Keep going. Sometimes you can pick up K-MOO drivin' south. Or here. Big Lake's got a station plays George Jones most afternoons. You like George Jones? You spend much time out this way? Who? Me? No. Like I said, my girlfriend. There's no girlfriend. It's just me. See, if I hadn't have gotten my money stolen. I wouldn't have been jumpin' out of the cake, and we never would've met. And you wouldn't be wastin' time drivin' me back to Bayview. I'm sorry I lied. That's all right. It's just. I'm really not myself right now. That's all right. And I'm married. That's all right too. America's number-one shop-at-home television service. bringing you 24 hours of savings, fun and excitement every day. Jesus. Will you look at this. Two days. Think if I'd been gone a week. If youre just joining us, you're not too late. Don't worry. We're alone. It's always on. Reese goes through a picture tube every six months. I make it a rule not to trespass. especially in a man's house I don't know. Well, believe me, it's more my house than it is his. Drop that anywhere. I'll be right back. You're welcome to a beer if you can find one. - I oughta be pushin' off. - What's that? I said, "I left my smokes in the truck." What the hell? Afternoon, Mr. Davies. I'm Earl Logan, Ned Foster's man. Is that your truck? Yeah. I mean. Well, I was wondering if we could get you to move it. See, it sure would make our job a whole lot easier. And I need you to sign here 'fore we can start. Watch your finger. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! They're. Hello? Hubie? This is Kay Davies. Does my husband happen to be there? Don't lie to me, Hubie! Shit! What the hell is that in the driveway? I think that they're lookin' for your husband. Well, they're not the only ones. Can I help you? Ma'am, I need the gentleman's signature so we can begin. You're not takin' my furniture. Ma'am, I'm not emotionally involved. Well, I am! Christ! "Boo-boo"? Since it looks like I'm not needed here anymore. Hey, Darlene. You haven't by any chance seen Reese, have you? You have. Really? Who are you? Never mind, Darlene. Here he is. Sorry to bother you. This don't look like a good time for introductions, so I'm gonna. Where'd you put that duffel? There. I understand all about schedules. Just give me a minute to get my ducks in line. Quack, Quack. Jesus, Kay, where in the hell have you been? Just what in the hell are you wearin'? And just who in the hell is this? You're askin' me Questions? Exactly what the hell is that truck doin' outside? Well, if you'd been here, Kay, maybe I wouldn't have to explain it to ya. I'm gone two days, and you sell the furniture? Well, if it makes you feel better, I sold it two weeks ago. Well, shit, Reese, that makes me feel a whole lot better. Look, I don't wanna talk about no goddamn chest of drawers, anyway. I wanna know who in the hell this man is. None of your fuckin' business. Hell, no. He's in my house with my woman. - Are you cheatin' with my wife? - Actually, I just. That's right, Reese. Not two hours ago. we were sweatin' over each other in the back room of the Shady 8 Motel. He don't mind it in the mornin'. And guess what, Reese. I haven't showered. or brushed my teeth. Actually, I just gave her a ride. in the truck. Now, you listen to me, darlin'. There are two men on our front lawn, and they got a job to do. Now, I'm gonna open that door, and you're gonna let 'em do it. Ain't that right? Fuck you. Go for it, Slick. You got yourself a real lionheart, Kay. Fuck my pretty wife now. Fuck this. - That's my gun. - Very good, Reese. It's your gun, in my hand, pointed at you. Get the picture? Christ, Kay, you don't even know how to use that thing. I got a pretty good idea. Now, Reese, darlin', I suggest you take your sorry ass outside. and tell the gentlemen on the lawn that the deal is off. I can't do that. - Christ, Kay! - Trust me, Reese. That clock ain't the only thing runnin' out of time. I took money. I shook hands, Kay. The deal is done. How much? Seven hundred dollars. - Where is it? - You know them bills we had to pay! Shit, Reese, you haven't paid a bill in three years. Where is it? Kay, I just told you. For God's sake, Kay. All right. It's gone. I lost it. Poker? Mostly. You sell that too? The piano? Hell, no. I bought you that for your birthday, Kay. - All right then. We'll take it. - Take it? You got room in the truck there, Arlan? - Wait just a second here. - It's Arlis. You don't even know his name? For Christ's sake, Kay, what in the hell has happened to you? Excuse me. Who's holding the gun here? You are. So I guess I can call anybody any damn thing I damn well please. Am I right? That's right. Sorry. Back there. Your name. Mixing it up. That's a horrible thing to do to a person. You were close enough. It's just I have a habit of doin' it when I get nervous. I got so mad at a boss of mine one time, I was screamin' at him. a full three minutes 'fore I realized I was callin' him Leroy. and his name was Ed. Not even close. It sort of took the sting out of it. Scary sometimes. What's that? Moments. Little split-seconds of time where you find yourself capable. of things you would never even think of doing normally. Like back there, holdin' that gun. There was a moment when my finger twitched. Not so you could see. More like inside, under the skin. Some crazy little muscle. And I could've done it. I could've shot him right in the face. My whole life would've changed in one tiny little second. It's not in your blood. Ain't that a kick? Yeah, it's a real tickler. You mind tellin' me what you got in here? Seven years of bad luck, at least what's left. Well, thank God the furniture's spoken for. Believe me, sooner or later, he'd have slapped a price tag on my ass. To hell with him. He's just taillights to me now. Not that he didn't leave a few dents behind. Let me see. You take a hell of a punch. Practice makes perfect. We'll get you some ice. Arlis, you're tellin'me this now? I've been settin'here all afternoon. I've been settin'here for three hours waitin'for you to call. Rosie, I told ya, something's come up. Something's come up, huh? Well, I know what's come up. You got another woman over there with you, don't you? - Don't you, Arlis? - Rosie, listen to me. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to town, go into a bar. and pick up the first man I see. I'm gonna pick up the first two men I see. I don't think that's such a good idea, do you, Rosie? You know what, Arlis? I don't care. Are you still there, or did you hang up on me? No, I'm still here. You're sort of an odd fellow, you know that? You don't ask many Questions. personal, I mean. I figure people share what they want to. No sense crowdin' 'em. Women must love you. Put that on your face once you're out. You mind grabbin' me another one of these? - Ever been married? - Nope. Ever been in love? - Am I crowdin' you? - No. - I've never been in love. - Me either. What about your husband? Hell, no. I mean, you saw his hair, right? Besides, he's no different than any of the others. I was 13 when the first one pulled my blue jeans off. and ever since, they seem to pass me off, one to another. my whole life. Like they're all members of the same club or something. You know, you look good without that hat. But you're gonna bald. See how high your peaks are? That's from wearin' the hat all day. You have to let your scalp breathe. Besides, you shouldn't hide your head. You got a nice shape. I'll keep that in mind. It's not 'cause of that, is it? The tattoo? I bet that was one crazy night. No more than any other. Well, whatever. Nothin' to feel shy about. You hardly notice it's there. Come on. Let's go for a little walk, okay? Why can't you sleep? The night air usually calms her. This stuff is awful. You sure you asked for Cover Girl? Yes, I asked. They were out. Well, my skin does not take to this. How I could forget my beauty bag, I do not know. Probably wouldn't fit in the suitcase. How do you abide this seat? Ten more miles, my ass'll be flat as a pancake. Seats take breakin' in. All right. I get the message. I'm not usually like this. If we'd met under normal circumstances. you'd probably like me. Most people do, or I guess they do. I didn't say I didn't like you. Hell, I like you. It's just that there's been a whole lot of. activity in the past couple of days. I go from one town to the next, you understand? I see the same faces. I hear the same talk. I sleep in the same beds. I eat the same food. Then I start all over again. I like it that way. I don't like walkin' into people's houses I don't know. I don't like guns comin' out of nowhere. I don't like lookin' over my shoulder for angry husbands. I don't like surprises, period. You really like me? What's not to like? Arlis, that stew of yours. has got to where it's nothin' but potatoes and carrots. I don't make it, Kyle; I just stock it. Hell, Homer and I are about the only ones who buy the damn stuff. We get up to our elbows in John Deere, we got no choice. I can go back to the chili if you want. Shit, no. We work close enough Quarters in that pit as it is. All I need is Homer's ass in my face after two cans of that. Now, I could stand a little of that in my face. She'd steal you blind. So old Sam found you, did she? - Came right up. - Yeah, she knows the truck. Here. Introduce yourself. You like that, don't you? Better than that scratch old Charley feeds you. - She'll follow you all day now. - What happened to her throat? She ran herself through a fence couple of years back. tore herself up pretty good. - Hey, girl. - But you're still here, ain't ya? You ride? Once or twice. County fairs, stuff like that. You? Once or twice. I bet you can't swim neither. That? Beginner's luck. Well, there was a cowboy a while back who showed me a thing or two. Comin' in? I'm fine. Suit yourself. So who showed you about horses? When I was about 12, 13, I worked at a little horse farm like this. I shoveled stalls during the day, got a roof over my head at night. Well, where was your mother? She died. How 'bout your father? Long story. He still alive? You ask all your cowboys this many Questions? Why don't you come on in here and cool off? We gotta go. I don't wanna go. Storm's comin'. There's no storm. I can feel it. How come some of them are blue? - Those dimes? - They're juke dimes. Juke dimes? What's that? I give the boss man a roll of these, he'll start up a jukebox. You play your own jukebox? That don't make sense. People don't make sense. Man walks into a place with a jukebox, right? Nine times out of ten, if that box isn't already playin'. he'll be shy about startin' it up or won't even know it's there. But you get it goin' for him. nine times out of ten, he'll keep it goin'. with his own money. Trick of the trade. How come you paint 'em blue? This keeps 'em separate from the boss man's money, that's all. You go east. Billy Breckins paints his green. Drop down two counties. Buddy Clarke, his are red. Me, I'm just partial to blue. You could use a trim. I got a man in Blackwell does me every third Wednesday of the month. I could do ya. A couple of snips here. Couple there. I think your hands are a couple of beers past steady. Yeah, I'd do you better blind than you been gettin'. Your man in Blackwell doesn't understand your head. Besides, I'm not drunk. I know exactly what I'm doin'. Looks like you were right. about that storm. What? Nothing. What? Did you say something? Is there somebody out there? Shit! Maybe it's Reese come. Jesus. Oh, thank God. I'm sorry to bother you, but the night man's gone to bed. and I'm having some trouble with my car. You try the bell? - The bell? - For the night man. Sure, but no one came. And no one along here would open their door to me. - You're the only one. - What's wrong with your car? Hell if I know. I am lost when it comes to anything mechanical. But you look like you might know something about motors. Am I right? - You got the keys? - Inside. - You got it in gear. - What? You got it in gear. Well, damn. You'd follow a mouse into the mouth of a snake. wouldn't you, Junior? He's hurt bad. Hurt bad? Honey, I cut my lip worse than this when I'm whistlin'. See, it's just that I can't fix it myself. and my sweet pea there, she don't know how. How long has it been, boy? Well, long time. no see. Ugly little bastards, ain't they? How's it look? I've seen worse. Yeah, I guess my whole life's back there. A good portion of yours too, huh, son? Be glad it's just bird seed chasing you this time. Not like that night in Kilgore, huh? Hell, come winter. it get cold enough. the pinch'll get somethin' fierce. Sometimes you can't get it all out. Sometimes you got to carry it with you. Now, don't get me wrong. You was always a good boy. You always did what you was told. Well, most of the time. I managed to raise the night man, and I have a key. Shit! Shouldn't we get a doctor? Little darlin', I don't believe there's a pill peddler alive. got a better touch than my boy here. And best of all, he don't ask no Questions. Practice makes perfect. You got an injured man here, boy. Easy, easy. That's nice. That's nice, that smell. You've got the smell of love on you, boy. Tell me. does she taste as good? Come here, boy. Get your father's boots off. That's the least a son can do. till he's ready to wear them himself. Get yourself out of those clothes before you catch a chill. Don't worry yourself. I never caught anything in my life. Everybody catches something. Not me. Well, I broke a finger once. but I don't figure that counts. Shit. This is too fucking weird. Wish I could say the same. I'm always catching a cold. Had one just last month. I'm sorry to hear it. You can't sleep in those. Find yourself something of mine. I'll hang yours up to dry. Come on. What's your name? Ginnie. With a J or a G? You plannin' on writin' me a letter? All right, keep it a mystery. It's a nice name either way. Yeah, well. I'm not a nice girl. But I'll bet that you are, aren't you? I'd like to think so. And the guy who did that to your face. did he think you were nice? Not at the time. But you stay with him anyway, don't you? Who, Arlis? He didn't do this to me. He's not like that at all. Don't kid yourself. Eventually, they are all like that. evil. But once you know that. you can turn it back against 'em. Use it. Arlis doesn't have an evil bone in his body. But. What? I don't know. I get the feeling. he's been close to it, felt the heat of it. I think that you're the one that's felt the heat of it. And not too long ago at that. There's a pretty cotton nightshirt in there with tulips on it. I know you'll love that. You don't exactly travel light, do you? Long story. Take anything you want. Well, how about this? That was my mother's. I'm sorry. This her? She's pretty. Yeah, I guess she was. Fuck. You lookin' for something? Three guesses. I had some serious shit in that car. - Your shit's still in it. - You mind telling me where? Across the tracks over there in Mesquite. You mind telling me why? Anybody see you last night? Last night? No. - You sure? - Yeah. You sure? Are you deaf? Yeah, I'm sure. Then whose pepper was I pickin' out of my father's shoulder? That? Some half-wit pump owner. stumbled onto us in the rain, took a wild shot and hit something. It was fluke luck. Nobody saw the car. I guess I just wasted my time. I guess you did. I'm his kin, you understand? I got no choice. So don't think this is some game that you're playin'. Last night, it could have just as easily been you out there. bleedin' in the rain. Only difference is, he'd have left you behind. or finished the job himself. Well, shit. No wonder old black eyes loves you. You wouldn't have the balls to shoo a fly off a steak. Warm you boys up? Is that one at a time or both together? You're a little devil, aren't you? I'd damn sure put the curl in your hair if you'd give me half a chance. I don't need a man for that. - There you go. - Thank you, ma'am. Oh, my God. Where you from? Why do you wanna know that? Who gave her that mask? Does it matter? I suppose you're right. People get what they deserve. What do you want? - If it's money, l. - Money? Money? Hey, boy. I don't need your money. Well, why are you here? I got shot. You fixed me up. I'm havin' some eggs. Does that seem strange? Just like old times, huh? Just coincidence. I had a loose end to take care of up north Oklahoma way. around Ardmore, them parts. An associate of mine. got a little greedy. Started threatenin'. Started to weigh on me. stole my sleep, and you know how I feel about loose ends. Being one myself. That's true, isn't it, Junior? He bought me lunch, and. he bought me a pack of cigarettes. After Oklahoma, I was working north, drifted on down. and run into this little girl over here. And I saw her. switching tickets at this diner in Cherry Spring. She had a full rancher's breakfast, and she pulled a switch. with this little old lady had coffee and a piece of pie. Little low-rent for you, ain't it? Well, it was the way she did it. Smooth as glass. Real nerve. Well, at least you won't go hungry. Well. she's a little bigger than that. The last couple months, she's been runnin' this slick little game. Thing of beauty. She steals from the dead. She's been sloppy about it, of course. Would've got caught if I hadn't come along. But she's got grit in spades. I'll have to watch my back with this one. Heart beats about twice a minute. At least it beats. Don't you kid yourself, Junior. You see, you and me. we're flesh and bone. The same blood that runs my veins. runs yours. - You seen my duffle? - Maybe in the truck. What happened last night. with your father? He just has a habit of puttin' himself. at the wrong place at the wrong time. What's all that? She hardly has a thing to wear from what I gather. Lord knows I got enough. Besides, most of these are full of bad memories. Not too many spring picnics here. This may not be none of my business, but. I run into that little scarecrow you got. runnin' that north territory up there. - Did he mention that? - He mentioned it. Yeah. - His name Eddie? - Elliot. Elliot, right. He's a nervous little son of a bitch, ain't he? Got a real strange way of walkin'. Them ankles so close together. You ever notice things like that? What's your point? Well. it might not be my place. It looked to me like he's stealin' from you, son. Elliot's an honest man. You sure know him better than I do. But it's just that, you see. I watched him at this fillin' station outside of Paint Rock. This one afternoon, he had him two sacks. and he was runnin' Quarters in the both of them. I guess it don't take no great genius. to count Clark Bars and figure out that you're short. He has been short, hasn't he? Short don't mean he's stealin'. No, I guess not. But then again, what else would it mean? Bye, y'all. You sure you're fit to travel? Hell, this ain't nothin', darlin'. I'm what you call a Quick healer. You ask Arlis there. I'd wreck my shoulder on a Sunday. and still give him a smack on a Monday. Ain't that right, son? There's a Texaco station about ten miles east. That'll be your last chance for a while. I appreciate that. Truly, l. Except I think we're gonna head up north there. around Benson County. You remember Benson County, don't you, Junior? I'm just needlin' him. Boy always hated it up there. Them locusts liked to drive him crazy. You take care, now. Get yourself packed. We're leavin'. It's funny. I'd have never put it together. him and you. If I'd met you separate, I'd never see the tie. I guess we don't get much choice in it, do we? What was all that talk about Benson County? Just talk. I don't remember the locusts at all. Pass me that bottle again, will ya? We finished the last we had. We or you? What's the difference? It's gone. Next place you see, you stop. You're the boss. That's strange. What? Look at that house up there. Looks familiar. Sure, that's the one in the photograph. Photograph? The one that lady had. I saw it in her suitcase when I went looking for a nightshirt. - You're wrong. - No. That roof was just the same. And the trees. And the windmill. There's dozens of houses look just like that up here. I'm positive. No one has lived in that house for years. Well, looks like it was a nice place once. I think whoever lived there would have kept it up. Not that house. What do you mean? Years ago, they say some Mexican. shot the man he was working for. and then shot the whole family right after. Jesus. I mean, that's the story I heard. It changes over the years. Who knows what the truth is anymore? No matter what the story is, it all comes back to one thing. What's that? Well, the house. They say it's haunted. But then, I don't believe in ghosts. All right, Darlene. Thanks. No, I'm glad you told me. Yeah, you too. Bye. I can't believe it. He filed for divorce, Reese did. I'm sorry. Sorry? I'm just amazed he could do the paperwork by himself. I wanna celebrate. Celebrate? Yeah, I feel free. for the first time in my life, I think, and I wanna celebrate. I wanna put on a pretty dress, get you out of that damn hat. and go have a nice big fat steak. What do you say? Any suggestions? Try C-17. C-17. How come this place is closed in the middle of the week? Pete's boy plays baseball for the local school. Anytime Tommy's set to pitch, Pete throws a lock on the place. and he rides the bus with the team. That's how come I got the key. He must trust you. I guess he does. You play this for all the girls, old C-17? First time. You an honest man, Arlis Sweeney? Yes, ma'am. You like the dress? I like the dress. You like the girl? I'd say she's the prettiest one in the room. Pretty enough to dance with? Well. Now, don't tell me you don't. Well, don't you think it's about time you learned? Dancin'. frees the soul. Howdy, partner. That's all I get after last night? Mornin'. Good mornin', darlin'. Why don't you shake on into the kitchen. and crack me a beer? Need some help? Get me two cases of Milky Ways by 9:00 a. M. 'cause that's what my hired man's gonna be lookin' to take with him. back to Crockett County. I haven't even got me one case. Hell, I ain't got a Milky Way, period. Well, I'm sure the good people of Crockett County. can do without a Milky Way for a day or two. It's my job, all right? We're a little surly in the morning, aren't we? That's okay. It runs in my family too. What's that? The morning bear. I said it runs in my family too. What else runs in your family? Your family. You never talk about 'em. Believe me, there's a lot more interesting things to talk about. than my family. I already told you everything that's worth tellin' anyway. Besides, I haven't seen them in years. Not since I got married. But when you were a kid growin' up, what were they like? What'd your mother do? What'd your father do? If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were crowdin' me. Maybe you don't know me. What'd my father do? Drink mostly. Gamble. Lost everything we had eventually. That's how I met Reese. Went to go collect my father one night at this place in the woods. where there was always an all-night game. and there they were, sittin' shoulder-to-shoulder. two drunks. Losing money faster than one sober fool ever could. Of course, I was a real fool. Ended up takin' Reese home. Stayed to make his breakfast. Never left. Why the sudden interest? Nothin'. I'm just. I happened to see that photograph. in your suitcase. Well, that's not me. It is me, but it isn't. See, my parents. The only parents I've ever known. are really my aunt and uncle by blood. I mean. the people in the photograph I never knew. They were lost when I was a baby. Killed. Car accident. Car accident? When I was old enough to know, I was given the picture and told about it. I don't know why I hang onto it. It's just. You grow up in an ugly house the way I did. sometimes you wonder how it might have been. if things hadn't happened the way they did. It's funny. Your father the other day. mentioned Benson County. That's where they lived, I'm pretty sure. The people in the picture. My family. I'm about ready. Listen. I think maybe it'd be better you stay here. Stay here? While I run up the road to tend to Elliot. There's some money over there. Get yourself something to eat while l. while I'm gone. Well, they must make one hell of a Spanish omelette. All right, I'll wait for ya. You don't want to be going anywhere without this. Earl's Truck Stop over in Coke County. run out of Cheez-Its again. Cheez-Its and truckers. They sure go together. And Phil Pritchard wants you to ring him up. about puttin' another Coke machine in his ice rink. I can't figure why he waited so long. - Two years I've been tellin' him. - You're a little light here. Yeah, well, I had trouble with the Mexicans again. They hurt the machines? Nothin' I couldn't put right with a crowbar. I had to replace the brace on one. Slung it with. a three-Quarter inch York. - That should solve your problem. - Should. But those boys are strong. Hell knows I couldn't pop her. - Without the key? - Yeah. Well, that's what I meant. without the key. You look like you had one too many cups of coffee, Elliot. It's the chill, I guess. Are you stealin' from me? You know I did time in Big Spring. I told you that right off day we met. But I did the time. I'm out now. and I want to stay that way. I'm not sure that answers my Question. You don't know. 'cause you've never been in trouble. But once you been in trouble. and people know it. you feel guilty for things you never done. Just because you know. they think you got it in you. That potential. Is that why your hands are shaking? That's why my hands are shaking. I like my job, Arlis. I like you. I like you too, Elliot. I'll see you next week. And Elliot, that business about the machines. It ain't the Mexicans. Up there they blame everything on the Mexicans. We asked 100 women this question. Give me the most popular answer. from the 100 women who answered. Tell me a reason why women leave their husbands. Infidelity. Did our women say infidelity? It's number one! Who needs him anyway? Stardust Motel. Emma, it's Arlis. Ring 12 for me, will you? Not unless you wanna talk to Theresa. She's pulling the sheets. Speaking of which, what do you want me to do with the suitcase? Suitcase? I'll have Jimmy put it in Maintenance. Just give me the word. I don't follow you. Where's the lady? Gone. Been gone about an hour now. They just got in the car and left. They? Who's they? She and her friend. A young lady in sunglasses. A real stinger, that one. Asked me for directions three times. then liked to take half the guest mints from the bowl. I swear, some people just have no manners. They say where they were goin'? Up north, I guess. The young one had gotten turned around. Wanted to know how to get back on the farm route. That doesn't help much. They could be anywhere in the county. It suits you. the dress. Well, you can have it back if that's what you mean. I'm just sayin' it suits you, that's all. You might think about doin' something with your hair. You got a nice face. You should let the boys see it. It ain't my face the boys wanna see. Maybe you haven't met the right boy. - And you have? - I thought so. Last night, at least, but now l. I don't know what to think. Look, you can't figure men. So don't run yourself ragged tryin'. I guess. I don't know why he just didn't call me himself. I told you, it's a surprise. I don't even know what's goin' on myself. I'm just doin' what I was told. Well, here we are. This is where we're goin'? I don't. Oh, my God. Surprise. Howdy. She's some old dame, ain't she? Look at that face, sweet pea. Does that break your heart? To pieces. First time you've seen it? - How did he know? - What's that now? The house. How did he know where it was? Oh, Arlis. He knows a lot more than he lets on. Anyway, sweet pea saw it and. said something about a photograph. - That about right? - Right. Where is he? He'll be along. Say, you wanna take a little look inside there, look around? Well, go on. But you be careful, now. Watch yourself, especially on them stairs there. There's more termites than there is timber by now. How was the movie? I got here as fast as I could. You talk to that clerk there at the motel? Dropped enough crumbs for a flock of geese. That's ten minutes. Where the hell you been? She had to pee twice. and I had to make a little stop of my own. I know how grim you get, you don't get your breakfast. You're smarter than I thought. I'm not smart enough to figure out what we're doin'. wastin' our time out here in cracker land. I'm gonna tell you all about loose ends some day. And you'll want to listen careful. You look like you've seen a ghost there, Junior. I hope you brought some food. You all right? Hell, he's fine. Just fine. Cat's got his tongue is all. Come on up. There's something I wanna show you. Watch your step, son. It's like heaven, isn't it? My mother must have stood right here. brushin' her hair. daydreamin'. I think I figured it out. I must've slept in here. or there. No. In front. In those days, houses like these. they used to put the baby in the front of the house. That way, if a woman was hangin' laundry and the baby cried. she could hear. Maybe my mother hung laundry out back. Sun's strongest in the front. You seem to know more about me than I do, so why don't you tell me. Were my parents good people? Were they nice to baby Kay? I'm sure they were. - What makes you so sure? - 'Cause you're good people. And good people come from good people. Ain't that right, son? - That's right. - I'm not so sure that's true. But it's nice of you to say. No, I'm. I'm not just saying it. I know it, and that's a fact. I'm gonna go outside. That's a good idea. Would you do me a favor? Would you take Ginnie while you're at it? She's probably down there bitin' on her nails by now. - I'll go with you. - No. I need to talk to you. Father to son, you know. Let the girls get some wind in their hair. We could walk for days, I bet, and never see anything but this. Wouldn't that be a thrill. See, it was the girl, sweet pea, that first mentioned it. the house being the same and all. I thought she had it all wrong, naturally. See, I knew I never seen this woman of yours before. 'cause I never forget a face. But. Still, there was something doggin' me. A sound. Halfway to Shreveport, I see a lady standin' by the side of the road. A mother. And that's when I knew what it was. That sound in my head. her cryin'. You see, I had forgotten. about the baby. What's that sound? You hear it? Bugs. She doesn't know. There's no reason for her to know, no reason for me to tell her. I realize that. I truly, truly do. But this woman, she's different. See, I noticed that the first time I seen her. The way she looked at you and the way you looked at her. It was touching, truly. She'll never know. I swear it on my life. Damn, I wish I could believe that. But as much as we are the same. you've always been a little too emotional. I left her this mornin'. I only came back 'cause of you. This little game. This ain't no game, Junior. You know me better than that. I must be out of my fuckin' mind. It's not gonna change, you know! They don't grow this stuff but one color. It's a shame, really. She's so sweet. Almost innocent. She is innocent. But I'm not. Take me. and she can't know. I couldn't do that. What kind of man would that make me? A man who'd shoot his own kin. I couldn't sleep with that, and I do prize my sleep. There's really only one Question here, son. Do I do it. or you? I could hear 'em. You don't mind if I smoke, do you? You know how I always enjoyed a good cigar. That's what separates me from other men. I can tell the difference. A good cigar's not what separates you from other men. What separates you, Junior? You fuck their wives? I don't shoot their children. You'd done what you were told, there would have been no blood that night. I didn't pull the trigger. But you opened the door, and they were supposed to be asleep. And you know they're always supposed to be asleep. Besides, wasn't me that shot first. I had no choice. And the boy? Did he have a choice? Fuck that little boy! He almost got your daddy killed. We had one bad night. It was 30 years ago. There was more than one bad night. But that was your night, wasn't it, Junior? You're right. You didn't pull the trigger. You did open the door. And now, you brung her to me. You're stupid. You've always been stupid. You was stupid when you were a little kid. As a man, shit, you're being stupid now. Who's got the gun, boy? Me? Go ahead, son. Put it on me and pull the trigger. Come on. See, you can't. You just can't. You can't because we're kin. Blood. Look, you go ahead and run along and fill up them candy machines. It's only right that I do it. This way, we both will sleep easy. Dad? Son? Sweet dreams. - What happened? - Get in the truck. - But. - Get in the truck! Everything he told you. it's a lie. Thanks for the advice. Don't be in a hurry to leave. They know me here for years, so you just stay as long as you want. Until you figure out your next step. You got your key? Yeah. I got my key. What was I doin' in that house today? Or am I crowdin' you? There are some things that. are better left unsaid. It just does no good to talk about 'em. No good at all. It's like I said. I'm a creature of habit. Each town I go, there's a place to eat. place to sleep. And in each town, there's also a woman. I'm startin' to miss 'em. Sure, I understand. I just sort of fell into your life anyway. There wasn't any reason to it. God knows I've been a burden. It's just. I really haven't been myself these last few days. Yes, you have. You've been fine. Better than fine. Looks like they're almost gone. The bruises. I better go. I got a jukebox up the road that's only playin' George Jones. That ain't so bad. I guess not. I stumble on any of those blue dimes of yours. maybe I'll use a couple of'em. give you a call, let you know how I'm doin'. You know where to find me. What's that on your pocket? That's nothin'. It's just a little blood. {{{the end}}} Ema Hesire, I know you're in there. The wedding has been all arranged. Please, gods. Please get me out of this. You turned down the jeweler. You turned down the grain merchant. You turned down the Pharaoh's food taster. There's only one man left who'll have you: You'll marry Hazzi-Ra. So what does he do? He's a fuel merchant. -Mother. -All right, so he sells camel dung. -Forget it. -You forget it. Mother, I don't want to settle down. I want to do things and invent things. I want to try things that nobody's ever tried before. -I want to fly. -Sure. And I want to smoke and tell your father to go to hell. Emmy, if I thought we women could any way change anything, don't you think I'd encourage you? No. Don't. These are the times we live in. Mother, there's got to be a better way. Please, gods. Please help me find it. Sure, the Nile is overflowing. There is a wheat shortage. The Pharaoh has hemorrhoids. The gods have bigger things to worry about than you. What would you say if I told you, you get more beautiful every day? What was that? Arms and legs? God, how thoughtless. I'm sorry. "I've got sunshine "On a cloudy day "When it's cold--" She needs a 10. "Cold outside--" What do you think? Speak up. Don't be shy, now. "I got the month of May" Wrong sex! Now, that's the ticket. Nothing beats a great pair of legs. "What can make me feel this way" Popeye look. "I got so much honey "All the bees envy me "I got the sweetest song that I can hear--" Boss! Hi! Great. I was just coming to see you. You know, you could get the dummy of the week award, Switcher. -Yeah, she turned out pretty real. -I wasn't talking about her. What do you think? It only took me six days. I could turn out three or four a month. You're supposed to knock off three or four of these a day, Switcher! -Now, get back to work! -What about quality, boss? Style and grace. These things take time. That's it! You're fired! Fired? Okay, but can I finish her? I'm a sculptor. I'm trying to be a sculptor and she's my work of-- Beat it! Now! There you go. Have fun. You guys having a good time? Having fun at the party? That's my boy. Here you go. Just one second. Here you go. Bye-bye. Want a giraffe for the birthday boy? A monkey? A pony? A tiger? -How about a hint? -I want the big one, stupid. That's the official Flights of Fancy balloon. How about a poodle? Listen, biscuit-brain, my old man is paying for this party. One giant balloon, coming up. There you go. Have fun. Now, what do you want? Daddy! Biscuit-brain, what the hell do you think you're doing? Take your hands off my kid! -My balloon! -You're fired. -Trimming the hedges long, Switcher? -Actually, no. I'm really a sculptor. But there's not too much work for us these days. But no reason why hedges can't become art. You're fired! Get your paycheck and get out of here! What do you think? What do I think? I'm fired! Pick up my paycheck and get out. -Look. The road warrior. -Hi, Roxie. His Jag's in the shop. Hi. It'd be nice if you'd pick me up in something with doors. -Come on. -So where are we going to dinner? I'm not that hungry. I thought maybe we'd grab a hot dog, go for a walk, look at the moon. You lost your job again? No, I didn't lose it, I know where it is. Just somebody else has got it. Can we get out of here? -Good night, Mr. Wert. -Nice work, children. -Good night, B.J. -See you tomorrow. -Who's that? -That's B.J. Wert, the regional manager. He is Illustra. Can we get this bucket of junk to go? Yeah, I'm trying. -Good night, Roxie. -Good night. Must be nice having your own limo. Go from any funeral right to dinner. This job at Illustra is destroying your sense of humor. You gotta quit. I'm not the one that can't deal with reality. Reality is very disappointing. I really do care about you. But I think if we sleep together tonight, we'd only confuse things. I think you should see a professional. Professional? You mean a hooker? No, a psychiatrist. I can't afford a psychiatrist. Then call one of those shrinks on the radio. They're only good for little problems that fit between commercials. Good night. Wait-- My God! It's you! I wanted to take you, but they wouldn't let me. You're the first thing I've created in a really long time that made me feel like an artist. No! See you tomorrow. Good morning! What a gentleman. They're putting up the sign! How fun! It's a skosh crooked. Isn't this exciting! A customer lined up to get into our store. -Tell me, do you like our new sign? -It's very nice. -You've really been here 100 years? -Not personally, but the store, yes. It was built by my grandfather, Tough Teddy Prince. My father ran it until he passed away recently. I'm sorry. He was very old. And he died the way he wanted to. In women's lingerie. Pardon me? Heart attack, walking through the women's department. They don't have that sign quite right yet. -Look out! -Sorry, man. Watch yourself! I got it! Maybe. Young man, I'm sorry! No, that's no problem! -lf I can make it up to you in any way. -Yeah! I could use a job! -What do you do? -Anything! -When can you start? -As soon as I finish this! -Young man, what's your name? -My name? Jonathan Switcher. You're hired! Thank you! My lucky day. Every time I walk through these doors, I feel like I'm home. I practically grew up here. Greta Garbo used to get her makeup right over there. Of course, you probably don't know who Greta Garbo is. Sure, I do. Ninotchka, Grand Hotel. I don't sleep much at night. Neither do I. At least, not in the two weeks since I've been in charge here. I don't know how we're going to make this store great again. Looks fine to me. What time do we open? We are open. I'm sure things'll pick up by lunch. Yes, B.J.. It's all going according to plan. It's like a ghost ship around here. They're gonna be begging to sell this place within a month. No, Timkin is no threat. B.J., she's here. Mr. Richards. Do you know what this young man just did? -Shoplifting? -He saved my life! Those incompetents you hired nearly got me killed. If I were paranoid, I'd swear this was sabotage. It's not as if I was turning away Harvard graduates. If you know someone you feel is qualified to work here.. Yes! Jonathan Switcher. Let's show him our gratitude. $5 should do it. No! I want you to give him a job. Take good care of him. Thank you. Switcher? What kind of work experience have you had? I've had just about every job there is. Briefly, I'd like to do something creative. Maybe with, say, mannequins. Please. Listen, I pride myself on being able to size up a job applicant and see just what kind of executive potential he has. I have just the job for you. So, you got a new job. That's terrific. What is it? Let's just say that thousands of dollars of merchandise go through my hands every day. I'm taking you out for a celebration dinner. -All those panties, up to lingerie. -Panties. I'm into it. -Did you say panties? -Panties? Can't talk now. Pick you up at 8:00. -See you then. -Bye. I've seen him pick you up. That little pissant! You can't tell me that he's satisfying you sexually. That's none of your business. I would like to make it my business. I would love to sink my teeth into your little bottom. What? Did Armand say something bad? Forgive me. English and me, it's new. My tongue, it slides. Look, our relationship is strictly business! -You got that? -Yes. Of course. I have some reports to get out by noon o'clock. -See anything you like? -I was just looking for panties. You found them. However, my friend, you missed the lingerie department by four floors. -Get going. -Right. Asshole. What was that? Nice hall. I must be losing my mind. All artists must fall in love with their creations, but you seem so special. God. Roll over, Bill Shakespeare. That's the sweetest sentiment these ears have ever heard. -No, I was rehearsing a play. -I always find it best not to explain. It adds a certain mystique to one's reputation. No. I'm a regular kind of guy, okay? Don't disappoint me. When you're finished your conversation bring her to window number 3. -Sure. You got it. I'm Jonathan Switcher. -Hollywood. Hollywood Montrose. Doesn't it just sing? It sings, yeah. I'm a window dresser here. We're going to have fun. I am so glad you're working here. -You are? -Why, of course I am, honey. I never thought they'd hire anyone stranger than me. Hello? Halt! -Identify yourself. -Jonathan Switcher, new stock boy. Yeah. Mr. Richards told me all about you. I am Capt. Felix Maxwell, night security commander. It's my responsibility to secure the perimeter here at Prince and Company. I didn't know there was danger of invasion. There's no danger, as long as me and Rambo are on patrol. -Rambo? -Yeah. I call him that because he likes to draw first blood. Just what is your assignment here tonight, boy? I'm helping Hollywood with the window. The little Mary has an assistant now? -Where do you people come from? -Ohio. Ohio? You mean they got them in Ohio? So, you like your new assignment? Could have been worse. Could have put me on with a bigoted jerk. Hold it there, boy! Did you have anybody particular in mind? You think he meant anybody in particular, Rambo? Don't let Felix get to you. He just has a bad case of Miami Vice. I gotta go, okay? I promised my girlfriend I was gonna take her out tonight. What happened? What did I say? Albert left me, that bitch. He said my thighs are too fat. -Do my thighs look too fat to you? -No. You didn't look! I don't know about men's thighs. They look fine to me. They really do. Thank you. Albert called me "cellulite city." Maybe he's right. Maybe I should have my hips lifted. No! If you want to lose weight, just diet. Diets are no use. It's those jelly doughnuts. They call to me in the middle of the night: "Hollywood. Come and get me." I can't stay away from them. -It's like you and women's dressing rooms. -No, that was a misunderstanding. Have any of your friends ever been vacuumed out? I heard those doctors in Beverly Hills they just open you up and suck those fat cells out of there. It sounds nice. I wonder if you could do it yourself, with a vacuum cleaner or something. Albert's been off work for an hour now. There's just no telling what he's gotten himself into. Take it easy, okay? Just go home and get yourself some rest. You'll be fine. An artiste does not leave his work unfinished. No, it looks fine to me. In that case, I'm a dream that once was. Look out, Albert, because Hollywood is on your case. Yeah, go get him. Good grief. What's the matter? Don't you like your new scarf? Not especially. Shit! What a funny way to say hello. What the hell's going on? My name is Ema Hesire, but you can call me Emmy. This is a joke, right? A Prince and Company initiation? Who hired you? Hollywood. Nobody hired me, Jonathan. You know who I am. No, this can't be happening. I know! The sign, the electricity. My brain synapse, it was destroyed. I felt so sorry for you last night. You looked so lost and Ionely. Last night, you saw me? No. You can't be her. When you made me, didn't you feel inspiration? Almost like your hands were being moved by a force not of this world? You made this body so that I could come to life! Am I in the twilight zone or am I just nuts? I'm so glad I picked you! I'm gonna create someone who doesn't like me? So, tell me your life story. It seems to have slipped my mind. It's a long story. See, I was born in 2514 B.C. in Edfu, Egypt. -I'll be 4,501 next April. -I'll bake a cake. Back then, I wasn't allowed to do anything. Do you know I was supposed to marry? -Who? -A camel dung dealer. Would have been my guess. I'm stressed. I'm having a hallucination caused by stress. Does this feel like a hallucination? Come on, let's go have some fun. Food additives. It's food additives. Come on! Except for early morning clouds the weather for the Greater Philadelphia area should remain the same.. Damn him. .with a slight increase in temperature. The things I could've done with these tools! -You like to work with your hands? -Yes. I love to build and invent things. -Back in Edfu, I even made a pair of wings. -And I'm sure you flew. That's right. Almost. You still don't believe I'm real, do you? I'm open for discussion. Why don't we stick to good, old-fashioned hand tools for now. -You've got good hands. -Thank you. I like the way they felt when you were putting me together. Tonight we'll do something different and special. Something this store has never seen before. I wish you didn't look so worried. Easy for you to say. As a mannequin, you'll always have work. Me, I'm gonna wind up in the nuthouse after this. I wonder if insanity is covered in the employee health plan? That's the dress I should wear in the window. Don't do that. You weren't so shy when you were creating me. You weren't so real. Good God, who are you? Good morning, boys and girls. I don't see Zingy. She just bit smiling Alan. You look foxy! Can I ride you? -I'll be walking to work. Thank you. -No! Don't be silly! Wait! I thought our plans were for 8:00 last night. My mistake. -I've got to talk to you. -We have nothing to talk about. Take a hike, wussy pants. Something happened last night. I'm going crazy. I saw things that couldn't have happened. Where were you? You look like you slept in the street. -Prince and Company. -Prince and Company! Your big job! You know the mannequin that I made? She's there. She came to life. She knew who I was. You could have told me you just decided to stand me up. Instead, you come here to me lying with this ridiculous story! No, I'm not lying, I'm insane. Armand, let's get out of here. Mom, when I was growing up, did I ever do anything really strange? Yeah, I know I was always different. Let me ask you this: Is there any history of insanity in the family? I mean, Grandma-- Grandma and Grandpa weren't half-brother and sister? No, I'm fine, Ma. You know, you're alone a lot. You start inventing things. Women, you know, a beautiful woman.. Enough about me. How are you? You ever have hallucinations? This is America. You do not set the pace by redecorating. -You demolish. -Of course. I'll remember that. We'll build the best Illustra yet on that site. And when I move up someone will have to take my place here. I'll be keeping my eye on you. B.J.! You won't believe it! Prince and Company has the most incredible window. I'm talking fabu. People were lined up outside to get a peek. At what? I passed it coming back from the tanning session. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Really? You know, it really wasn't that great. It was interesting. In a jejune way, at best. I didn't care for it myself. You know.. You should have seen it! It was beyond brilliant! There was 20 mannequins with tennis rackets coming out of.. Beej, he's just a twerpy stock boy! That window was a fluke. When I move up, somebody will have to take my place here. But if you let that stock boy screw things up, it sure won't be you. I've worked on this deal too long to have it ruined by some snot-nosed punk. I can handle him. I meant you! Of course you did. But you know that the board meeting is today. I guarantee the sale will go through. Under your inspired leadership, Illustra will reach new heights. So we-- Richardsl Where in the hell did you learn to kiss ass like that? Did you take a class? No, sir. That's a God-given gift. Beej? B.J., are you there? We'd all love to know what possessed Switcher to create such a window display. Did you see those crowds gaping on the sidewalk? It's an embarrassment! Never you fear, your Hollywood is here. Rumor Control has it that the board wants to fire your little behind. You let me in there at those so-and-sos. I'll straighten them out, tout de suite. How can they think of firing you? They're business people. They won't appreciate an emotional appeal. You're right. I was hoping to avoid this, but this is an hour of desperation. This is not the way to approach this, okay? You don't think so? Please don't tell anyone you saw me dressed like this. I have a reputation to uphold. My lips are sealed. I appreciate this demonstration. That's it! A demonstration! I'll create a media event. Call the newspaper, boys and girls. The headline will read: "If Jonathan is fired, Hollywood flies." Excuse me while I step out onto the window ledge. No! Come on. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. -I do get carried away sometimes. -No, not you. That Richards, he gives men a bad name! No! Mr. Richards said he was gonna fix everything for me. What arrogance! That worm of a stock boy has created an affront to the dignity of this store. I'll have it taken down immediately and make sure that lunatic never works in this town again. What say, shall we move on to the sale to Illustra? Just a minute, Mr. Richards. I believe we're onto something here. Maybe people will come to see our bold, new window displays. If they come to look, they'll stay to buy. With all due respect, Mrs. Timkin, it's a little late for that. And we do have the firm offer from Illustra. For one tenth the value of the store! Besides, I can't bear the thought of selling this place especially to that awful B.J. Wert. We know how much the store means to you, ma'am but, 10 percent is better than bankruptcy. I think Mrs. Timkin is right. I move we postpone the sale for six weeks. I second the motion. All in favor? All opposed? This meeting is adjourned. -Harris, would you bring Mr. Switcher in? -What? No, wait. I think-- Good news. We've not only decided to keep you on but I'm promoting you to visual merchandiser. You're kidding! That's great! What is it? Just keep doing what you did last night and you'll be fine. I'm not sure I can do it again. Last night might have been a one-time inspiration. Don't doubt yourself. Go with it. Feel it. You're doing the job you were meant to do. You must lead a charmed life. It was all I could do to save your skin in here. No thanks are necessary. Good evening, Mr. Richards, sir. Listen, that new stock boy, Switcher, has been promoted. He'll be doing windows at night. Just keep an eye on him for me. Do you suspect pilferage, sir? I'd be happy to strip-search him. You people that work at night scare me. I just want you to let me know what he's up to, how he works. Yes, sir. His M.O. Would you like that in a written report? You write? No. Rambo does. -Just watch him. -Yes, sir. Come on, Rambo. We have got ourselves a mission. Jesus Christ, Rambo! Hi, it's me! Jonathan, remember? I guess it was just temporary insanity. "O ye of little faith." You're back! I thought-- You remind me of my old boyfriend, Chris. He didn't have any confidence, either. -Chris? Who's Chris? -Just a sailor. I told him that the world was round and I never saw him again. Christopher Columbus? You knew him? So, you didn't come here directly from Edfu? No. I tried out different times and places but none of them ever seemed right. You didn't happen to run into Michelangelo? Michelangelo. Yes! He wasn't very interested in me. He was involved with some guy named David. -Come on. -Were you there? Mrs. Timkin loved what you did last night, but they think I did it. They want me to keep doing brilliant windows. -You've gotta help me. -Of course. You are magic. Where do they hide all the musicians? -Come on, let's dance! -No. I can't. Shake that thing! Great. I want you to meet somebody. This is Emmy. Very nice. Maybe I can get G.I. Joe, and we can double sometime. No! You don't understand. She-- Don't say nothing. It's cool. It's obvious to this country girl that you're an A-number one creative freak. Imagine pretending to be a stock boy when you're a major artiste. I am so jealous. Some people may find you strange, but not me. I respect that. Create, honey, create! I'll leave you two alone and go meet Albert for dinner. -I hope he doesn't mind. -No. Just when I think you're real, you vanish. What's with you? -What's with me? -Didn't I tell you? You're the only one who can see me like this. -That's not exactly fair, is it? -Talk to them. Do you hear something? Wait a minute. Okay, you Rambo, get ready. Attack! Rambo. What? Stay there! Easy, Felix. I don't think she's armed. You can fool Rambo, but it won't work with me, Switcher! My brain is quicker than a-- I think that we've outdone ourselves. Yeah, this one's kind of fun. -Ready? -Let her rip. Very nice. -Good morning, Mrs. T. -Good morning, Jonathan. What do you think? It's hot, there's gonna be meltdown. Yes! Hot, smoking, burning, churning, whatever! Oh yes! Hello? Hi, Jonathan. Hi. It's me, Roxie. I thought you weren't talking to me. I wanted to see you. I want to know you're all right. I gotta get some sleep. I work nights now, okay? All right, but get up in time for lunch. I'm taking you to Chez Jacques at 1:00. You know where it is. Yeah, I was fired from that place once, I almost burned that joint down. It'll be just like old times. And please don't stand me up again. Yeah, okay. Bye. He'll be there. Love that gal. Hi, Tony. Hi, Hans! I see you're wearing the nighttime hair at lunch now. Looks good. It's you. The flambe terrorist. Will you not be satisfied till you burn the whole place down? It was an accident. I tried to show the customer a little flair. Jonathan! -You're here to dine? -That's right, old boy! By the way, the eyebrows are growing back nice. Sorry I'm late, I overslept. That's okay. You're only an hour late. Just glad you made it. I love this place. It's so romantic. Yeah! Boy, they did a good job rebuilding the balcony. It went up like a Roman candle. Jonathan, it seems like I was all wrong about you. And I have a way of making it up for you. How would you like to be the chief window dresser at Illustra? You're kidding. Word is out, Jonathan. You're hot. Can you imagine being at Illustra? -They want me? -We want you. What if I told you I had a little help? Fine. There's two of you? You can bring him along. And what if I told you it was a very beautiful woman? I wouldn't mind. Not in the least. I can't do it. -Monday, we'll work together. -You're not listening. You can drive me to work. I miss that quirky little motorcycle of yours. -I'm not taking the job. -What? Why not? If I'm one thing, I'm Ioyal. Jonathan, you're not seriously turning me down? I'm not the same guy I used to be. I finally found a place where I belong. I'll see you around. I got it! Don't panic! It's just a little one! Bye, Roxie! There's something strange going on in the store at night, Mr. Richards. Every time Rambo sees a mannequin, he gets so scared his little pug tail comes right out his little mouth. -Felix, you were in the war, weren't you? -Airborne. Yes, sir! Did you jump out of a plane and land on your face? Yes, sir! I don't see what it has to do with Rambo. Isn't it obvious Switcher is behind all of this? That skunk! An eternal failure is putting together the most magnificent displays in town. The bum. You say you hear voices, there's no one there. Just him and his dummies. Is someone helping him? Is he a ventriloquist? Some kind of mad genius? Good questions all, sir. Find out the answers! Yes, sir! What about little Rambo? Screw your dog! Let's go, people, clear out. -Clear out, lady! -Stop pushing, okay? I'm going. Come on, Rambo. Tonight we nail that little fart blossom. On behalf of Capt. Clark and the crew we'd like to thank you for flying with Eastern. And we hope you enjoy your fun-filled day in the Caribbean. We deserve this vacation. The sun feels pretty strong. I could use some suntan lotion if someone were willing to rub it on. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it. We are alone. Okay. So, listen, we find him, get a picture of whoever this woman is and get out. If we can't hire Jonathan, maybe at least we can buy her out. I don't know about you, but I've always wanted to make love in the ladies' shoe department. The smell of fine leather. Can I show you something in your size? What? You mean you took me serious? You're gonna pay for that. Stop it! Don't! Mayday! Mayday, Rambo. Okay, boy. Okay. Show 'em what you're made of. Go get 'em! Rambo! This way! This means a court-martial! You hear that? That must be them. I wish it was us. Come on. We've got them. -Give up? -Never. Switcher. You are one sick puppy. So this is the young lady he dumped you for? Nice. Beauteous! I really should have listened when he asked me for help. Tell me, when you were making love to him did you ever scream, "Don't stop, woody"? My camera. No, this is how I get my inspiration. I create. I can tell by looking at you, you're not the artistic type. You know, Mr. Richards told me to keep an eye on you, but I think I'm gonna handle things my own way. You want to move your sweetheart? That one was for Rambo. Switcher, this is for my Mama! Switcher. Switcher, I'm gonna knock you into the middle of next week! How'd you do that? I was standing behind him, he didn't see me. Teach him to mess with a man and his mannequin. Where'd you go? This is your last chance. We take him or we die trying! I did it! I flew! I really flew! -Are you all right? -Terrific, incredible, I feel great! Did you see how high I was? I just had a thought. You think we should name our first kid Pinocchio? Jonathan are you sure this is right for you? I'm positive. What about you? You've waited a long time. How do you know you're not missing something better 5,000 years later? Nothing could ever be better than being here with you. This is one guy who's never gonna leave your side. The window! Come on. It's almost sunrise. We can't possibly finish it! Don't worry about a thing. But we'll never dress the mannequins in time! That's right! Absolutely scintillating! Beyond genius! It sucks. Fool. I don't believe it's lunch yet. Let's not dally. Felix! What happened? Why don't you tell me? Where's Rambo? It's that Switcher. I caught him doing awful things to a half-naked dummy. Richards, is this your idea of a security guard? -I assure you I had nothing to do-- -You hired him, you fire him. What if he's telling the truth? How can you think that? The man is a lunatic, but I've never known him to lie. He's absolutely right. Mr. Richards, this store has never been more successful. It's all due to Jonathan Switcher. He can put a rubber glove on his head and run naked in the store yelling: "Hi, I'm a squid!" Hi. 'Morning, Mrs. T. Hello, Jonathan. This morning's window is your most brilliant yet. Thank you. What happened here? God only knows. Felix, did you try and take Omaha Beach all by yourself, again? -I was doing what Mr. Richards told me to. -I never said anything. Is that right? Richards when you take Felix to get his last paycheck get your own as well. Mrs. Timkin, you may be our grande dame but I've had serious doubts about a woman your age running this store. I'll appeal to the board. I can't imagine you're appealing to anybody. Don't mess with this old chick, mister. Just pack it up. Jonathan, let's go. And get that dog out of the tree. You can't do this! We'll file a grievance with the union! You're not in a union, you idiot. Hi there, Jonathan. I didn't know you were in there. Excuse me. That's lovely. What the hell are you people doing? Have you seen the latest figures, children? 89 percent. Sales are down 89 percent! Prince and Company is going through the roof! All right. Now, I want this to stop, children. And if it doesn't, so help me God! You are all dead meat! Jonathan, it is my honor to inform you that starting Monday morning you'll be the youngest vice president ever at Prince and Company. -Congratulations. -Hear, hear! -I don't know what to say. -Say, "Thank you." Thank you! Long live Prince and Company. Cheers. Son of a gun. So, Richards was telling the truth. I've been in this business 20 years. Hell, half the guys in this store probably wear lace underwear but, this.. We're talking a Sunday drive into some serious dementia. It's our move now. I'd do anything for Illustra but these pictures could kind of ruin his life. Roxie, I'd never ruin anyone's life. I would, but only if it were absolutely necessary. Roxie, you're not developing a conscience on me, are you? No, I don't think so. Good. Anyway, I don't want to ruin his life I just want to hire him. And now I know how. Hi, Gord. -Miss Thomas, hi. -Please, Jonathan, it's all yours. -Thanks. Men's room is broken. -Of course, dear, whatever you say. -Congratulations. -Thank you. You won't believe what Mrs. Timkin and the board just told me. -Vice president. -Jonathan, that's wonderful! Tina, Moni, he's talking to the dummy again. Nobody deserves it more. I knew this would happen for you. Creative freedom, practically my own boss, maybe some World Series tickets. All right, I'm sorry. I'm going on and on. I couldn't do this without you. I won't take the job unless we can be together. Jonathan you can't worry about what will happen to us. What does that mean? Girls, please, let's not be catty. I simply will not tolerate eavesdropping unless I'm a part of it. I assume my Jonathan is in there. You can't go in. He's got company, if you know what I mean. And who do you think introduced them? At least she'll never say your hips are too fat. Hollywood! Jeez, listen. You know I would never bother you when you're getting a piece of wood but this is muy importante. Your Hollywood needs help. -What's up? -I need your creative muse. I've always thought of myself as hot stuff, the very best at what I do. But seeing you, let's just say it, I'm dirt. Mold me. Shape me. I'm a fast learner. Please, Jonathan, do not let them turn me out into that dark night alone. We can talk about designs and stuff but when I work, I gotta work alone. Of course. I understand perfectly. You're an artiste, and that's the way you work. I can respect that. Jesus. Hollywood, listen, don't worry. You can work as long as you want here, I'm a vice president now. Who's crying? It's either our new vice president, the fairy or the dummy. Emmy, please, you've gotta help me. I can't come alive in front of Hollywood. Besides, you can do it on your own. How can you say that? We do everything together! You can't hold yourself back because of me. Now, come on. Hollywood's waiting. You'll do a masterpiece tonight. Emmy.. I'll be waiting in the window. Jonathan, how about a picture? Mom will think I've switched. Hollywood, you're a genius! I am? Yes! Okay, we need to make a list. Fire away. 30 feet of black nylon cord.. Sounds like my kind of list. Easy, sugar. Okay.. You personally vouch for this guy? He's worked at Prince and Company for 15 years. I think he'll be just fine. He's an imbecile, but.. This is him. Felix, come in. This is Mr. B.J. Wert. Mr. Wert, sir! It's fine. Felix, there are hundreds of mannequins at Prince and Company. Will you be able to identify the one Jonathan Switcher has a romantic interest in? Absolutely, sir. I never forget a name or a face, Mr. Nertz. Good. Felix, we need your help, and if you succeed you will have a cushy new job right here at Illustra. We want to get Switcher's mannequin out of the store and bring her here, secretly of course. A covert operation. I would be happy and proud to lead this mission, sir! Good! It's the most beautiful window I've ever seen. It's all you. -Not this time. -Every time. You're part of me now. I got you in here. Come on. You ready to go? Are you sure you wanna do this? Absolutely. You've been cooped up in that store too long. Besides, who cares what people think? Just put your arms around me and hold on tight. With pleasure. Jonathan! Look, Jonathan, I know about your problem. What problem? You're riding with a mannequin on the back of your motorcycle. What is wrong with this picture? Right, you two haven't met. Roxie, this is Emmy. Emmy, Roxie. Nice to meet.. My God, what am I saying? Jonathan, I wanna give you one last chance. Now, come to Illustra! What is in this for you, Roxie? An office with a view? I don't need Illustra or you. I got friends here, people who care and someone who makes me feel good about myself. Bye, Roxie. You'll be sorry! You're making a big mistake! Roxie.. He's out of his mind! B.J. was right. When I get that dummy, I'm gonna tear her hair out! You know what you need to do right now? You need to put him and this whole nasty affair out of your mind. Now, how is the best way to do that? By having a night of distasteable sex with someone that you care absolutely nothing about. And proudly, I would like to be that person. Fine, let's just go to your place. Really? Drive fast before I have second thoughts! Armand is the wind! Mr. Richards, you'd better put some camouflage on, sir. I am not going to put shoe polish on my face, thank you. Now, could we please get into the store, Felix? Yes, sir. Look at him with a dummy! Who are you to criticize? It's him! It's her! That little prevert! He's stealing her before we can! Don't do anything rash! We'll follow them, and at the right moment, grab her. Don't worry, Mr. Richards, I'm an expert at surveillance. Hang on! Where'd he go? That way. That is it! No more of this surveillance crap. Capt. Felix Maxwell takes this from no mannequin! No! Get us out of here before he gets out of the car! Watch out! Hang on! You're finished, Switcher! You may as well hang up your jockey strap! Let me go! No, Mr. Richards! No! -Be careful, you maniac! -I know! This is for you, Rambo. We got him! -I want to get out. -Geronimo! I don't understand it. This never happened to Armand before. Never! It must be you. You're so cold. You're so unfeeling. Where can I get a mannequin, too? Jonathan. What are you thinking about? The window. Turned out pretty didn't it? It was breathtaking. Emmy Ema Hesire you inspire me. I feel like I could do anything. Windows are only the start. I think we could design an entire city. No one takes the time to build things that have character and dignity. People need that. We could give it to them. I love you, Emmy. I love you, too, Jonathan. I better get into the window. That peckerhead doubled back on me. I saw his motorcycle out front. That dummy of his has got to be here! This is the one! You're positive? Absotively! Wait a minute. This one kinda looks like her, too. I've put my future in the hands of a vegetable. Just get the mannequin. Get the mannequin. -It's over there! -No, this is the door. This is not the door! This is the door. Wait. Mr. Richards did you ever notice how they all sort of look alike? Look at that one. Maybe this is her. This is really interesting. This is art. -It's like theater. -I get it! Excuse me. Good morning, starshine. I sleep alone these days, too, but I am not about to advertise it. Get my clothes? Spent the night? You slept through the whole how-do-you-do. What do you mean? All the girl mannequins disappeared from the windows last night film at 11:00. Yes, my dear your favorite, she is gone. Emmy? Jonathan. That was great! I'm sorry, but you know us special people are destined for heartache. You know what works best for me? Crying shamelessly. Don't do anything drastic! Me, my! Okay, now. Wait a minute. Yes. My car cover, darling. Yes. Yes, girl. Jonathan, wait! Roxie. Roxie Shield. -Can I help you? -Roxie Shield. -She's in conference-- -Thank you. You can't go in there! Security. Jonathan! We were hoping you might drop in. Can I get you something to drink? Where is she, Roxie? She's perfectly safe. Jonathan, let's talk about your future here at Illustra. I think it'll be wonderful to have the team back together again. -What'd you do with her? -Relax, it's just a mannequin. How does $55,000 a year sound to you? -You son of a bitch! -All right, $60,000. I don't think he's of Illustra fiber. Where is she? -You'll never see her again! -Where you going? We also have a very nice profit-sharing plan. We have extremely incriminating photos of you and that little.. Get up, Richards! Get him! Sorry, gotta run. Security alert! Man in leather jacket! Come on! Get.. All units, code 2. Perpetrator on main floor. Roger. Over and out. Come on, Terminator. Duty calls. Excuse me. Roxie! Call the police! The SWATteam. Go away. Felix! Switcher. Terminator lunchtime. Get him! Nice dog. Shit! Switcher! Where did he go? There he is! No! -Get him! -You're finished, Switcher! You've had it, Switcher! Get me out of here! Put me down, you idiot! Let's go. You've had it, Switcher! I'm gonna get you! You're finished, little Switcher! Yoo-hoo boys! Way to go, buddy! Two things I love to do: that's fight and kiss boys. Come on! Come and get me, Sister Maryella. What's the matter, honey? Come on. This is what being a man is all about, honey. You can't come in here. Emmy! Mine's bigger than yours is. Why can't we get that damn water turned off? Shit. Go! Shoot him! Jonathan, you saved me. It's nothing, really. I'm alive. What? He can see me and I'm still alive! You are! Thank you! -Thank you. -What is it? -You're gonna have to love me forever. -I always have, I always will. Move! -Get out of the way, doofus! -Move, damn it! It's a miracle! Stop it! You little creep! Stop touching me! Get away from me! Please don't touch me! Roxie. -Jesus, it's the heat! -Hollywood. Now, this is Emmy. Mama, put the coins on my eyes, 'cause I sure don't believe what I am seeing. There he is. Arrest that man. Who's she? She's who I came for. She's the dummy! I said, "Arrest that man!" Keep your hands off him! Claire, thank goodness you're here. These people.. Shut up! B.J., you really screwed up. What are you talking about? When I fired this idiot the other day, I decided to replace him with one of those camera surveillance systems. I have Richards and this moron on videotape. I was sure you were behind this. You greedy snake! Claire! I want those two arrested for breaking and entering and grand theft. I'll get you later for conspiracy. You can add kidnapping to that, too. -Kidnapping? Who? -Me! Who are you? She's the dummy! This poor man is having a breakdown. Get him out of here! She's the dummy! -She's the dummy! -Please, don't use force. Mamal I want my mamal Mrs. Timkin, those video cameras, did they pick up everything last night? I only saw what I needed to see. Just where did you come from? Roxie, you would never understand. Claire.. There must be some arrangement we can make? Cram it, clown! -Come on, now. -No, boys. You know, I see executive potential here. Roxie, you're fired! You'll never work in this town again! How am I gonna pay my bills, my rent, my new watch, my car.. l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. We must reduce a bloated government and restore its creative power. To reinvigorate our society-- My name is Jay Bulworth. California families who work hard and pay taxes shouldn`t pay for those who don`t. l`m Jay Bulworth. l believe in a hand up, not a hand down. l need your support. l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re at the doorstep of a new millennium. l`ll fight to end affirmative action. l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re at the doorstep of a new millennium. l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re at the doorstep of a new millennium. Our welfare system is out of control. l`m Jay Bulworth. We`re at the doorstep.. Connie and l have been married 24 years. She`s been a loving partner, and, more importantly, my friend. Jay`s been a great senator but his best job is husband and father. l believe in the values of honesty, decency and fidelity. Join me to strengthen California`s families. l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. We can`t afford privileges on the basis of race. Discrimination in the past doesn`t justify it now. l`m Jay Bulworth. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. Our welfare system is out of control. Too often, welfare subsidizes able-bodied people who should make a living. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. We must reduce our bloated federal government.. This is a phone answering machine. Leave a message. Pick up the phone. l know you`re there. Pork bellies indeed. l`ve spoken with Hong Kong, and l`m upset! That`s the wrong word. l`m pissed, pissed, pissed! l warned you about Fenner and his harebrained pork-belly schemes. And now l hear you invested everything you had and they`re selling short! The senator would love to have drinks with the Sultan. ls he in Beverly Hills? -Has he buzzed yet? -No. -Feldman call? -lt`s 6:1 5 a.m. in L.A. So? Get Liebowitz and Macavoy. l`ve got two hands. l can`t grow another. l didn`t ask you to. Make the calls. And Mr. Chow? What about Mr. Ling? Did his check clear? Hey, senator. lt`s a beautiful morning. Birds are singing. Leaves are doing whatever leaves do. You eat anything? lt`s Friday. That pizza`s from Wednesday. Did Fenner call? You sold short and they`re up. l mean, is that a disaster? Do l look like a disaster to you? The polls aren`t good. We`re down by four points. But the new spots are huge. Sunday brunch will bring us $900 grand. -They`ll ask about the insurance bill. -Which one? Makes insurance companies sell it to poor people. -That`s good. -Not for the companies. -We work for them? -We do, or we don`t have jobs. We`re trying to get 50 grand a table. Missy Berliner, Los Angeles Times. Last week, your challenger said you were ''an old liberal wine trying to pour himself into a conservative bottle.'' We`re at the doorstep of a new millennium. -That mistake can hurt. -What? ''Both sides'' remark. Hi, Constance. Murphy, do you think l have nothing better to do than wait around? l don`t mind helping, but you could get your staff to show some respect for my time. What about ''both sides''? We said we`d go with, ''l`ll get back to you.'' ''Both sides'' says the other side is worth considering. -Where`s Becky? -She doesn`t want to do this. ls she mad? She`s 1 7. Send her money, she`ll be fine. -Smile in the back. -That`s it. Any other help you can give, make the check payable to ''Bulworth `96.'' Cholesterol, liver function, blood pressure, EKG, all fine. -Are you eating? -No, thanks. Have you experienced a loss of appetite? l`m not hungry, thanks. When did you eat? Will the Wangs be in California? -Hello, Helen. -Hello, Mr. Crockett. Mr. Crockett, American lnsurance Federation. Jay? Jay? Are you saying you haven`t eaten or slept in three days? You should talk to someone. l`ll give you a name. Milton Alexander, a psychiatrist. l have a meeting. This bill will devastate us. -Crockett. -l`ll call back. -How`s he doing? -Fine. -How are you doing? -Fine. -You? -Fine. Can you believe this bill? ls the whole world going insane? Consider the strain in relationships with state commissioners. Or rate changes. This will cost us billions. The usual people are making trouble. l don`t mean African-Americans. l have no problem with African-Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King, Colin Powell, Michael Jordan. l have no problem with them. They have jobs. Throw down some lazy, welfare-taking drug-dealing, rap-singing punk, and say my people have to give him a policy. So he can burn down his house, smoke crack and get AlDS? You can`t get AlDS by burning a house. Vinnie! Vinnie, you son of a bitch! How are you? How you been? Other than a prostate like a coffeecake, terrific. -Not to use an old phrase, but-- -The bill`s un-American. l have confidence that you can bottle up this bill in committee. What`s that? Your homeowner`s insurance, disability, liability and a few million dollars in life insurance. -l`ve always had 10. -What? -Ten million. -Pesos? Senator. What we said was a couple million, paid to your daughter-- Four payments, 2.5 million each to my daughter. Would five do it? Why don`t we say seven? Ten is a whole hell of a lot of life insurance. lf Jay Bulworth plays ball, we`ll play ball. -Senator, this is Vinnie. -How are you? Ready for the research project? Davers, can you excuse us? Thanks. Senator, l`ll be right outside. Small bills. Must l use Davers to talk to you? Davers can always reach me. Did he ask you what the weekend research project was? Good. Nobody knows but you and me. You and me, senator. Here are photos of the person. Give them to whoever`s doing the-- -Research. -Research. First time l`ve gotten a guy to off a guy. -.not knowing who it is. -You mean research. -Yeah, research. -You said you didn`t have to know. l don`t wanna know who it is. l don`t want nobody knowing about me. We need to talk, we call Eddie Davers. Nobody knows nothing. Except one thing. -What? -Who`s the guy? -You just said-- -That was in the abstract. We`re really doing it, you don`t tell me who this is.. Simple math. Take a look. Excuse me. -What`s the gag? -He arrives at LAX tomorrow night at 8:40 on American Airlines. Second half of the money. lf l`m not dead by Monday, l`ll stop payment. Thank you for flying with us. Have a pleasant stay in Los Angeles. As you exit, flight agents will direct you to any connecting flights. Have a nice day. Welcome back to California. We`re running late, so let me go over some changes. The total from the brunch is 1 .1 . We got two from oil, and lawyers just south of 100. Gloria Alred got excited over your O.J. statement. Even the women came in with about 65. Our new schedule is a black church, then Beverly Hills. He`s here. -You should drink with the Sultan. -He`s nuts. -Welcome home. -What`s this? 24 hours on the Campaign Trail. This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN. Fred Tinsdale and Mimi Binder. Mimi and l will be behind you in the truck. C-SPAN will be with us all night? All weekend. The show airs tomorrow at 2. -Where are we going? -First stop is South Central. Did you get a copy of the schedule? We`ll be busy. The African-American community. Your African-American constituents don`t forget how you helped. -Where are we going? -Grace Church, senator. -Fred? -What? -Have you covered Bulworth? -These go by the book. ln Beverly Hills we meet big names in entertainment. Scotty, how are you? Vivian, Rwanda. My goodness. l didn`t expect you to be here. How are you feeling? Did you sleep on the plane? Did Mr. Murphy forget someone? Murphy, the senator-- Whoops. Senator? Senator Bulworth. The senator from California, Senator Jay Billington Bulworth. That`s a nice piece of timing. -Amen. -Senator your speech, sir. We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium. Listen. l put some time in this. --restore its creative power. To reinvigorate our society and bring about a rebirth of democracy. Any questions? Nice. Less is more. After the riots, you promised funding to rebuild. What happened? What happened was we all knew it was big news, so we came down here Bush, Clinton, Wilson, all of us told you what you wanted to hear and forgot about it. -Did you hear that? -Let`s see where he goes. We can`t get any insurance here. Health or life insurance. Why aren`t you in favor of Bill 2720? You haven`t contributed any money to my campaign, have you? Know how much insurance companies give? They depend on me to bottle up the bill in my committee. Then we can kill it. When you say ''by the book,'' what book is that? -Democrats don`t care about us? -lsn`t it obvious? Your kids are either jobless or in jail. Do you see any Democrat doing anything about it? Certainly not me. What`ll you do, vote Republican? You know you`re not. Let`s call a spade a spade. l mean, you can have a Billion Man March. lf you don`t support somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife you`ll never get rid of somebody like me. Fire! Fire! Fire alarm, Nina, let`s be out! This way, senator. What are you doing? That was good. That was really good. Does anybody know where the fire is? Where`s the fire? l don`t understand where it is. lt`s very worrying that in 1 990 in L.A. black churches are burning. Smoke? l don`t smell shit. l don`t know where the fire is. We have to be going. Thank you. Senator! We`re into politics. We want to work on your campaign. We want to volunteer. -On to Beverly Hills. -We really into politics. -Nina. -l hope the fire department gets here. -Yo. -Yo to you. -Later. -l was hoping sooner. -What`d you say? -Later is good. -You macking on my sister? -No macking here. Senator, l think we should go. We have to go. -My friends want to volunteer. -Volunteer? We didn`t hear the heart of your speech. You have support in this area. -Nina. -Oh, yes. You can`t deny the value of a frank exchange. What does ''mack'' mean? Macavoy, what does ''mack'' mean? ''Macking on my sister.'' Senator, your opponent, Hugh Weldie, has just leapt on the neoconservative bandwagon. ls your sciatic nerve bothering you again? No, l`m fine. Our people find Weldie`s duplicity particularly.. You`ve had a tough day. l`ll cover for you at the Liebowitzes`. Cover? After all the money we worked these guys for? -They give us more than the Chinese. -Tell you what. l have an idea. Pull over. Gary, you and l will go to headquarters. That`s a good idea. Let`s do that. We`ll meet in Beverly Hills. This is better. You`ll get a real look at how a campaign operates. You eat on the plane, sir? -Nope. -When did you last eat? Wednesday. Pull in here. l`m starving. Let`s get some chicken wings. This is getting uncomfortable. A third of the guests have left, a third are drunk. When will he be here? Any second. He`s had such a day. My guess is he`s working out a new guarantee with the State Department. -A new guarantee? -The West Bank. Didn`t hear it from me. He`ll be here soon. Senator Bulworth here we are, volunteer valets! You know Manny and Dorothy Liebowitz. Hi, it`s good to see you. Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman left but security of the West Bank is more important than your being here. -l got a bite. -Come in. We`ll be out soon. We can`t ask the Liebowitzes to open their home to television. Nonsense. Mi casa es su casa. Miss. Thank you very much. Do you think the entertainment business needs government help to limit sex and violence in today`s films and TV? You know, the funny thing is how lousy your stuff is. You make violent films, dirty films and family films. Most of them aren`t good, are they? So many smart people can work so hard, spend so much money and make so much money. What is it? lt must be the money. lt turns everything to crap. But how much money do you need? Miss, be honest and don`t spare my feelings. Are there more crispy crabcakes? Wait. Just wait. You can`t-- Why do you schedule campaign stops with industry leaders when you don`t like their product? My guys aren`t stupid. They always schedule the big Jews. -You`re mostly Jews, right? -Excuse me? There`s something bad about Farrakhan in here. Thank you, senator. l know l speak for you when l say l`m energized by this. Replay that crabcakes remark. That`s just great. Everyone was very challenged by your candor. Let Bob Dole smoke that. Get out! You`re all fired! Fuck you! We`re volunteers. You can`t fire volunteers. We stayed too long, anyway. We out! -You want a ride? -Yeah. Get the stuff. Get in the limo, big butt. -Where we going? -Where can we drop you? To La Brea. We`ll get a bus there. -We going down to Frankie`s. -Frankie`s? We`ll take you. -l don`t want to go. -What`s Frankie`s? -We`re going. -Let`s go, Macavoy. l can`t stand when people flex their authority. Don`t feel bad about going to the hotel and getting some sleep. Letterman is no Arsenio Hall. -He`s a two-minute brother. -You buggin`. l heard the head of his jimmy is big as an apple. Let`s look at the new 30-second spot. What do you know about his jimmy? -Jimmy? -Shanequa James saw it. -You mean his dick! -l like you serving the potato salad. Very dynamic. She gave him the nappy dugout. -Nappy dugout? -Man got a nine-inch jimmy. She booty-ugly. How you hit that? Nappy dugout. Hit it. Some of the nappy-- Frisbee tricks. Ladies, the senator has a meeting with the cardinal in the morning. lf l meet with them, can l dump the sultan? Let me just make a security check. Bulworth! You got your pail or mop? Can you sing, Bulworth? You couldn`t be a ghost. You got to sing. Be a spirit. That`s how these niggas got here. Ghosts got them. Be a spirit! The spirit will not descend without song. You got to sing, fool. Don`t be no ghost, Bulworth. -No cameras. -Tough break, Gary. l thought they`d let you in but the camera must make them nervous. -He with you? -He all right. Check your weapons. l don`t think we have any weapons. -Expecting trouble? -No. His family owns a pork shop for five years. Go on, you`re good. Good to see you, my friend. That`s-- What you said at the church? Brave. lf you haven`t been able to talk to me, you can now. -Stand by the door. -Why? -Lookout. -No one can get in. Good work. Sit down. Senator? Sir, if you`re having-- Excuse me. l need to talk to him. lf you`re having a problem, we should talk about it. What are you concerned about? That you told 300 people in a black church they`re not a factor as long as we`re ruled by insurance. You went to a fundraiser and told people their product is lousy. As many of them are Jewish you thought it prudent to mock their paranoia. We`re in an after-hours club in Compton on the eve of the campaign. Where there`s illegal activity, and you`re smoking marijuana. You call the shots. l can do my job much better if you just tell me: what is this new strategy? Have a drink, Murphy. Live your life. Bartender. What are you doing here? Chillin`? Damn! Leroy, get over here. Have a drink on me. Look who`s here. Clint Eastwood. -That ain`t Clint Eastwood. -What do you mean? -That`s George Hamilton. -George Hamilton? He got a TV show. Hey, George. -.what`s up, man? -Goddamn. -He with you? -Yeah. What`s happening? l don`t care who you know. You can`t come in. What you doing? This is fun, but l`m telling Macavoy to get ready to go. Put it away. Stop. -You lost, mister? -How you doing? This place isn`t for you. Can we talk? This place is for real niggas. He ain`t no nigga. -l ain`t what? -You ain`t a real nigga. -ls you a real nigga? -What`d you say? Don`t call me nigga, motherfucker. Would you prefer motherfucker? What the fuck? -You can`t call me no motherfucker. -Shit. -What? -Get out of here. -l don`t need you covering me. -Move it. -Where you going? -Get in your car and go. l saw you rush your brother out. He owes me money. You`d bust a cap up his ass. Motherfucker rip off L.D., he`s dead. Straight up. l give everybody protection. Right? l can give you protection or pain. lt`s wrong to embarrass me. Wrong and detrimental to my life. That motherfucker owes me money. l`m working on getting it. l`m tired of playing with you. You always say that. l said l`ll get it. The only reason his legs ain`t snapped is he`s your brother. What l really want to know ls where did little Nina go? l`m looking here and there But l can`t find her anywhere Where, oh, where ls little Nina? l`m hunting for Nina Hello, Nina Where you beena? Nina, Nina Has anybody seen her? Nina, Nina Where you beena? You`re the prettiest girl-- Leave. Okay, okay, you come downstairs And then we`ll play. Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry. Watch yourself, motherfucker! -You sorry-ass motherfucker! -l`m sorry. Keep walking, bitch. l`ll whip your ass. l`ll give you $5 to buy a new suit! Excuse me. l`m sorry. -He won`t leave. -He`s not tired? l doubt he`s slept in the past five days. -What? -He`s rhyming now. -Rhyming? -Rhyming. He`s talking in rhymes. lt`s very, very disconcerting. Nina, Nina l`m over here This is good, give it a chance l never even knew that l could dance Some people can And some people can`t l don`t care lf l split my pants We had a next-door neighbor who`d lose her mind. What`s weird was when she was like that, she`d only speak in lyrics. You look pretty beat You`ll feel better With ribs to eat Eat `em You`ll think they`re fine lf you want more You can get them any time l`m incredibly frightened. That George Hamilton sure can move. Hey, guys! -Senator, sir! -The fundraiser! Senator Bulworth? The Beverly Wilshire fundraiser starts in five minutes! The brunch begins in five minutes, but are you up to speaking? Up? What`s up?

Campaign finance reform is your key issue? lt`s the only way to go lf they pay the piper The piper does their show You got that right, senator. Bye, fellas! lf you`d wait in here for a moment, sir. l`ll be back to take you to the car. Patricia lreland is expected in town. Will you have a meeting with her? Hi. That speech was phat. -Phat? -You got a room here? A room we can go to upstairs? -A room. -A room. What do you wanna do? Proceed to church, then the debate? Or we can shut down.

Oh, sure. -Feldman? -Yeah? -The key? -Right. Sorry. -What? -l`m sorry, it`s in the car. He needs his room key. Senator, we have to get in the car now, sir. Key`s in the car. Let`s go. What do you say we get you 40 winks? -Nina and l are going to the room. -That`s not a good idea. You and her, now? l got a better idea. You and l get in the limo and circle back when you want to. Why would l? Will the insurance industry respond well? Senator, where is the nappy dugout? The nappy dugout`s Where you get the bug out -Who are the girls? -They`re friends, can`t you see Feldman, Feldman Where`s that key You got the key in your hand. You got the life. Ain`t it grand? You got the life. You got to be a spirit. Can`t be no ghost. You got it all, Bulworth. Ain`t life grand? Ain`t it grand? You got the life, man. Let`s go, Macavoy. We`re moving. Get the phone. l need Davers. You got to be a spirit, not a ghost! -Do you know where Davers is? -No, sir. -Maybe at our next stop. -You`ve had a crushing weekend-- This is Eddie Davers. Leave a message. You should get sleep. Davers, it`s the senator. Once you get this message call the man you introduced me to. Tell him he has to cancel the weekend research project. That`s important. See you at the church. Macavoy, the church. We drop our supporters off. Where can we take you young ladies? Senator, what a pleasure. ls Mrs. Bulworth under the weather? She`s fine. l`ll be with you shortly. -You got a choir in church? -Watch out, l`m with the network. Get in there and find Davers. Cancel the project. The weekend research project has be canceled. Macavoy, go in there and find Davers. l gotta find Davers. -You see him? -No. We`re honored by the attendance of U.S. Senator Jay Bulworth. Let us rejoice in his presence and sing hymn number 376. -Out of the car. -Why? l got some problems, and you`re not safe with me. -What does that mean? -Just gotta get-- -Are you afraid of somebody? -Yeah. lf you`re so afraid, why not tell me why? -l just need a guy to call a guy. -Why don`t you call yourself? l don`t know how. -Okay. Let`s go back to the hotel. -l gotta stay out of sight. lt is worse than arrogance. lt is contempt for the press and contempt for the people. Have you heard that Gephardt`s looking for somebody? l`ll stay out of sight till he gets back. We`ll wait in the car. Hi, Mimi. We seem to have lost our ride to the debate. -Could we catch a ride with you? -He split with the limo? So who walks in? Huey Newton. You know who Huey Newton was? A lot of people l talk to, black, your age, have no idea. Huey. Why are there no more black leaders? Some say because they all got killed. l think it`s the decimation of urban manufacturing base. An optimistic population throws up optimistic leaders. Shift manufacturing to the Third World you destroy the blue-collar core of the black people. Some would say the problem is cultural. The media`s controlled by fewer people. Add to that, a consumer culture based on self-gratification. lt`s unlikely they want leaders calling for sacrifice. lf l look at the economy, domestic employment means jobs for African-Americans. World War ll meant jobs for black folks. That energized the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. Energized communities produce leaders. Leaders they`ll respond to. What do you think? -What do you think my age is? -Your age? You said black people my age. Twenty-three? Twenty-six. All right, how old do you think l am? How old? Sixty. My mother was a Panther. Huey fed kids on my block. Senator, aren`t you late for the debate? Davers, Davers, Davers. l`ve been looking for you everywhere. We have to call Vinnie. You know what l get out of this place? Bupkus. Talk to you later. -lt`s Nina. -You fucking bimbo. l couldn`t get him up to the room. You weren`t supposed to push him off. All you had to do is get him upstairs. l`ve had it! Vinnie, wait. Don`t ''Vinnie'' me. You move on to plan B. What the fuck is plan B? You know plan B. And you better get it done. You said if l get him up to the room l`d get 10 Gs. -Fucking bimbo. -Vinnie! Vinnie! Davers. The senator wants to speak to you. Hey, Vinnie, my friend! How are you? l`m very relieved to get in touch with you. We`re gonna have to call off the weekend research project. -Call it off? -ls it a problem? -Not a problem. -Change of plans. But look, you keep the fee, by all means. -ls that a problem? -No. Good! Good, good, Vinnie. Let me ask you a favor. Can we keep this between the two of us? You and me, and whoever you got doing this thing? -We`re gonna need a surcharge. -Fine. -Cancellation fee. -Okay, just keep the check. No, an additional $50,000. An additional.. Good. l`ll send Davers over with another check. Shall we consider it done? -Yeah. -Wonderful. Wonderful. Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks. You`re welcome. Crazy motherfucker. What is a ''weekend research project''? lt`s nothing. lt`s all off. The guy is nuts. -l don`t feel good. -Want something? Vinnie, you want something? Vinnie? -l gotta go. l`m out. -All right! All right! We`re late, we`re late For a very important debate l`m feeling great While feeling my fate Senator! Senator, you want some fresh clothes? lf you want to hide, l got the place. You think after this crap is over, maybe you could hang? -Hang? -Hang. Hang out with me? Oh, hang. Hang out. -What do you think? -Yeah. l got the plan. Wanna meet my family tonight? That would-- Great. That`s great l got a whole new slate l meet the family l can hardly wait l think he`s recognizing the situation. -.and getting some sleep. -There`s.. Okay, listen to me. l won`t let him on TV until there`s some explanation. We`ll say he got sick, stuck in traffic. We`ll stand here and block him, arms akimbo if needed. Prevent him from doing damage to his and our careers. l`m explicitly authorizing the use of force. -Murphy, Feldman, Macavoy. -Hi, boss. Didn`t work, but he`s okay now. Got the razor? -Got it. -Get him to shave. They`re ready. How about a quick shave? The format agreed to is as follows: Questions will be addressed to each candidate in alternating order. Candidates have two minutes to answer. The other has one minute to reply. The first candidate has 30 seconds for a final comment. Each candidate will make a final statement. Mr. Weldie won the drawing of lots, he`s elected to.. l was supposed to set him up, not do it. Now l can`t get Vinnie on the phone. The first question is for Senator Bulworth. We have to ask about the change in your campaign style. Come on. Why are you here? Let`s admit it, because you`re making a bundle. -l beg your pardon? -You`re not here because of the money? Come on. We got three rich guys here getting paid by some really rich guys to ask a couple of other rich guys questions about their campaign. But our campaigns are financed by the same guys that pay you. So why are we talking? l`m bringing him down. They can kiss my ass. l could tell you stories about getting money. Stories about me. l don`t know about.. Hugh, do you have that.? But l tell you we got a club. Republicans, Democrats what`s the difference? Your guys, my guys, it`s club. So why don`t we just have a drink? Hugh? No? Hugh, if you win, think about where you put your kids in school. We put our daughter in Sidwell Friends. Any public school is a disaster. Excuse me, senator, at the moment we`re here. -.to ask about the news of your-- -News? The guys we get our money from don`t want the people to have news. Corporations are more efficient. Know why health care is the most profitable? lnsurance takes 24 cents out of a dollar spent. For the government to do the same for Medicare takes three cents. What`s this crap about business being efficient? What the hell is going on? They need to be regulated. You think they`ll regulate themselves? What`s going on? Gentlemen, it seems as if we`re experiencing technical difficulties. Hey, Hugh, what`s up? What`s up? What`s happening, baby? Huh? l`m bringing him down there, goddamn it. Stand by. We`re experiencing technical difficulties. What`s going on? Are we gonna do this? We`re doing the best we can. Oh, hi, Davers. Power failure. He wants to crash and burn his entire career? Fine. Fuck him! But l`ll be damned if he takes us down with him. l`ve been completely loyal to that fucker. l`ve had other offers, you know. Plenty. Didn`t he have it all, though? Looks, brains, more or less, classy wife. But Jesus Christ, Bill, he had us. The motherfucker had us. lf he had listened to me on welfare reform in `88. lf he`d just chased not quite so much pussy could`ve gone all the way. We still might. But now, with this shit, we`re fucked in the ass. Fucked with our pants down! Cocksucker! Fuck. Hi, Larry. Murphy, Murphy, Murphy. How the hell are you? -Ever seen anything like this? -lt is very unusual stuff. -l don`t know what to say. -l`d say l`m gonna have to do a show on this. Oh, my God, Larry. Come on, do you have to? -Are you sure? -Are you kidding? He`s on a roll. They want him. People are sick of this baloney. -l want him on my show. -That`s what l told him. The man`s got this giant vision! lt`s so gratifying that he`s listening. That`s between you and me. What are we talking about? -Tonight? -We got Clinton. Bump him! Just kidding. How about tomorrow? -Book him. -We`ll call you. -Nobody`s seen this for years. -This is it! Your boy is it! -He`s it. -You`ve got insight. No, you`ve got insight, you`re the guy who saw it. Senator, l`m afraid we`re gonna have to cancel this. They don`t wanna bump Jerry Springer. Sorry, folks. Senator, do you feel like you need a vacation? -Does it get to you? -No. Why? l`m confused. l like to play ball but you all play much rougher. l`ll be outside. -l have your policy. -Oh, forget it. l don`t need it. -Everything okay? -Okay is not the word for it. Pork bellies are way down, and you`re back in the chips. -Did you deliver the check? -Poor guy. -What? -He collapsed. -What? He collapsed? -He had a heart attack. When you have a moment, we have to sit down. Did he cancel the project? -l guess so. -You guess so? He was in a coma. l left the check. -Where is he? -Cedars, intensive care. You turned off the power! He told the truth! You didn`t want the American people to hear what he had to say, Frank! Go sit with him until he wakes up. Ask him if he canceled the research project. lf he didn`t ask him who`s he gotta call. -Okay, boss. -Senator.. Get out! Get out of the car. You gotta get out! You`re crazy, Bulworth. Larry King`s pissed, and he`s not alone! How about the FCC? Ever heard of the F-fucking-CCC? Now, you listen to me. You`re running an election special tonight. Guess what? l want my candidate on. Are we hiding again? Because l said l got a safe place. Safe? Safe. Senator, l think we`re back on track. You gotta be here at 7:30. State of American Politics. Dole, Clinton, and a piece on you. lt`s five minutes guaranteed. Live, no delay. Why ''Oh, no''? Just be back at 7:30. By the way, you doing your own driving-- lt`s very effective, sir. Jam? You`re not in a jam, sir. People are sick of all the baloney! But you didn`t want to play it safe. lt`s not the time for safe. Where are you? Senator Bulworth? l`m losing you, sir. Hello? Hello?

Momma Doll is me and Tyrone`s mama. And Rafeeq is Tyrone`s son by Vanetta, who died in `83. And Nina and Darnell`s mama passed. She was the baby. l`m gonna tell him l`m going to the cleaners. The lights are low Between your legs l`ll go -Don`t play with your food. -He`s doing no harm. lf he is, l`ll tell him. l`m gonna check on the suit. Taking too long. Where are you going?

These little brothers is my eyes and ears out there. Where`s Nina? l`m giving them entry-level positions into the only growth occupation open to them: The substance supply industry. They`ll run this shit someday. You greedy politicians don`t give a fuck. That`s what you say every time you cut school programs and funds to job programs. How can a man support himself working at motherfucking Burger King? And don`t even start with school shit. No education`s going on because you politicians fucked it up. So what`s a young man to do? What will he do? He`ll come to me, because l`m a businessman. These shorties are a businessman`s limited liabilities because of their limited vulnerability to legal sanctions. lt`s the same in politics. Find an edge, exploit it. That`s why you sent them teenagers to lraq. Die over some motherfucking oil. Send the ClA slangin` in the `hood. Same shit in politics. A homie got to risk his neck and fight For what he believes And he gotta preach it right lf he don`t got shit to die for Afraid to shed the light He ain`t got shit to live for Scumbag ls that how white people rap?

Fidelity Providence has been helping families.. Senator, the glasses. That`s the style, isn`t it? That`s the style. --providing health plans, life insurance for the changing face of America. You can trust Fidelity Providence. Welcome back. We have incumbent Democratic Senator Jay Bulworth. Good evening, senator. Senator, why this new campaign style? Why the new manner of dress and speech? Your ethnic manner of speech, your clothes. -The use of obscenity. -Obscenity? The rich gets richer while The middle class gets more poor Making billions And billions and billions And billions of bucks lf you weren`t rich at the start That situation sucks `Cause the richest motherfucker ln five of us ls getting 98 percent of it And every other motherfucker ls left to wonder where We went with it-- Obscenity? l`m a senator. l got to raise $10,000 a day in D.C. l don`t get it in South Central, but in Beverly Hills. l vote in the Senate the way they want and l send my bills.

''Fuck.'' ''Cocksucker.'' The obscenity Black folks live with every day ls trying to believe a word Politicians say Obscenity? l`m Jay Bulworth And l`ve come to say The Democratic party`s Got some shit to pay ls gonna pay it in the ghetto ls gonna pay it in the-- You mean Democrats don`t care about the Afro-Amer--?

American families Can`t buy a meal Ask a brother if he`s getting a deal A white boy busting ass Till he`s in his grave Ain`t gotta be black To live like a slave The rich stay on top by dividing white people from colored people. White people are more like the colored than the rich. -We just got to eliminate them. -Eliminate? -Rich people? -White people. Black, brown, yellow people. Get rid of them. We need a voluntary, open-ended program of procreative racial deconstruction. Fuck till we`re all the same color. Damn! lt`s gonna take a while-- Thank you. We`ll return with former Governor Lamar Alexander. Bulworth? You should get some sleep. Get away. This guy`s a hit man. Shoot them together. Are you shooting them both? Get them in a two-shot. lt isn`t worth shit without a two-shot. Get her back over there. Here`s the picture, right here. You`re not getting the shot! You`re not getting it! She`s leaving! -Stand here! -Get off my case! -l`m asking, did you get the shot? -Of course l got it! -You didn`t get it. -l got it! Wasn`t the guy. Few days ago, l made a deal with a guy for a lot of life insurance. And then l paid a guy to hire a guy to kill me. l tried to cancel, but the guy l paid is in a coma. l can`t reach whoever he hired to tell him the job`s off. There`s a lesson here, which is never make life or death decisions when you`re feeling suicidal, because you can`t-- Vinnie too cheap for a hit man. l had to get you upstairs so he could push you off the balcony. When l didn`t get you up there, he said to get paid l would have to do it myself. Here. l changed my mind. What? So you get it? Ain`t nobody gonna kill you. You get it? Jay. Senator Bulworth, elaborately costumed made no explanation for his more casual mode of dress and behavior. How can a man support himself working in a Burger King? And don`t start with school. No education`s going on. Obscenity? l`m a senator. Yo, shut up. Shut up! lf they could afford Johnnie Cochran.. The senator`s meeting with advisors. Yes, l`m an advisor. l`ll be meeting with him too. Good morning? Sandy, of course l know where he is. Meeting with advisors. Yeah. Okay, bye. Where is he? Attention is focused on California with one day of campaigning left. ln the senatorial race Hugh Weldie began campaigning early this morning. His opponent, Senator Bulworth, is with advisors. Call it single payer or Canadian Way Socialized medicine will save the day Let me hear that dirty word Socialism! Where is Senator Bulworth? Where is Jay Bulworth? Where is Senator Bulworth? With the Bulworth campaign moments from the primary it`s keeping its candidate under wraps. The obscenity Black folks live with every day ls trying to believe a word Politicians say Obscenity? l`m Jay Bulworth and l`ve-- -Should we call the police? -You think that`s the press we need? Where is Senator Bulworth? Where is Senator Bulworth? Where is Senator Bulworth? People are asking this election day after the senator astonished everyone by making no appearances. Campaign chief Dennis Murphy said the senator would meet with the press today. California primary night, and nobody`s seen anything quite like it. The surprise is Senator Bulworth. Not only has he won the Democratic senatorial nomination with 7 1% of the vote, he`s received 1 5% of the Democratic and 8% of the Republican vote as a write-in for president. Political analysts are bewildered at this unprecedented turn of events. Nina`s no idiot. lf she was hiding the senator-- What? lf she was hiding the senator, what? -ls he still sleeping? -Still sleeping. .if he is here. Feldman? Feldman? An unusual situation. Hey, L.D., what`s up? Got customers. L.D., man, come on. What`s up? House looks good, Momma Doll. They can`t see the flowers. -The man`s in a close-up. -They should show my flowers. Hey, man. lt`s important that l speak with Senator Bulworth. ls he here? Wait in the street. l can`t wait in the street. l`m very cool. l`m the senator`s chief of staff. And don`t mess up the flowers. Some sort of powwow at the door. Maybe we can get information. Will the senator make a statement? Very shortly, l promise. Missy Berliner. This is contempt for the press. He`s been missing for two days. Do we call Robert Stack? ls he in there? -We got a problem. -He still sleeping? Bulworth Democrats agree on one thing: Leading is more important than winning. Sit tight. -What`s up, L.D.? -He owes me money. -You`ll get it. -l don`t want it. -What? -He don`t want it. Look at me. Look at me, brother. You`ll work it off. Work it off? Doing what? Things need to be done in the `hood. You`re gonna help me do them. lf you don`t help me do them-- Come here. l got a reputation to protect, so you have to wear these. lf you help me, you wear these casts without breaking your legs. l`m about to flip this power shit. For the sake of your daughter, l hope-- Hi. Hi. -Good sleep? -Yes, thank you. Good to see you. -How are you, senator? -Very well. You have a very comfortable guest room. -Good to see you. -You`re on TV. May l borrow the telephone? l think l`m late at my headquarters. l can`t thank you enough for your hospitality. General, stay for supper. We got kale. He likes collard greens. No, he just thinks it`s collard greens. Hey, senator. Congratulations. We met not long ago at your office. -At my office. -Good to see you. Senator? ls this great? This is great! -Congratula-- What are you wearing? -What? You have to get into the old clothes. That`s part of it. -He thinks it`s the clothes. -l said it`s part of it. Senator, my strategy is you run as an independent. l`m confident we could-- We got to take advantage of this fucker while he`s still crazy. -You with it? -l`m down. We`re just beginning. You know what l mean? How about that write-in for president?! -We`re where we want. -You my nigger! You won! -l love you so much, l swear to God. -Don`t swear. Congratulations. We`ll take Santa Monica to get to the hotel. -Olympic`s better. -Does anyone know where the limo is? -Find an old car. -Limo`s paid for. -l got a taxi outside. -Taxi`s good.

[typewriter clacking] ["That Haunting Melody" playing in background] Mm. This place is starting to look more like a. museum. than a storefront.

I brought your book. - You left it at the store. - Oh, thanks. You. you really didn't have to do that. I was passing through so, you know, passing through. Yeah. You know what? You should stay. Um. - Yeah, I don't. - Come on. Order a drink. Okay. Can I get a whiskey, neat? Oh, that's Vicki and Steve. They're here every week, same time, doing the same thing. - Oh. - Yeah. [both laughing] Come on. What's up, Check? Ended up with this sailboat that I bought on eBay when I was drunk out of my mind. That cannot be true. Um. It's true. It's true. Paton's honor. [both laugh] But like I always say, life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. You always say that? Did you come up with that? I always say it and. No. No. But. you know, whoever said it, it's true, no matter what. Right. [laughing hysterically] [music slows] No. [sighs] Please tell me you took something. I didn't take anything. Gimme your hand. - Why? - Just gimme your hand. Cross your eyes. Cross. Close your eyes. Open. Did I pass, officer? This isn't a joke. I'll be right back. [instrumental music plays] Claire? Oh, I love those. Stay away from me, okay? Um, hey look, I. I'm just trying to be a friend here. [scoffs] Uh. uh. [receipt prints] $41.12 [cash register dings] Ay. hey [speaking in sing song] Um. hm. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. [Jo] What's at Graystone? It sounds spooky. I'm not crazy. [traffic sounds] What? [laughs] All right, all right, all right. [laughs] Favorite color on three. All right. One. [laughs] Two. [laughs] - Three. - Paloma. [laughs] What is Paloma? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. [train tooting] What? Nothing. I like it. I've never been anywhere. - Not even on a road trip? - No. No? My parents traveled a lot before us kids came along and then. [sighs] things got complicated. Is that because of Graystone? [Claire scoffs] My turn. Why are you here? I followed you up here. [snorts and laughs] Okay, that sounded a lot less creepier in my head. [both laugh] [Jo] Okay, my turn. Question two. What's Graystone? [train tooting in the distance] Place where you send crazy people. - Really? - Yeah. Are we gonna end up there? [laughs] [door opens] [door shuts] [chimes chiming] Hi, Claire. Hi. What's goin' on? I just needed to get some of Dad's old files. [scoffs] Right. Everything should be back here. [clears throat] What're you doing? Um. I'm trying to fix this typewriter. I think I broke it. I like these drawings. Yeah? Me too. Is it your book? Sorta. If it your friend's book? Um. Is she here? What? I've got a couple of offers already. You can't sell the shop. It's Dad's. I can. He left it to me. Um, if you don't want it, I can take it. You can't expect me to do that, Claire. Why not? Come on, Lily. ["That Haunting Melody" playing] [birds chirping] [sighs] Well, you know that. I. I'm going to need a new tailor. The. The clothes here. I. they just don't seem to fit me they way I'm used to them. Nothing fits right. I think you look fine. Oh, well, thank you. And. where's Frank? Dad died. He had a stroke. Well, when is the funeral? It was last week. - Oh. - I should've told you sooner. Sorry, I just. Was it a nice service? Yeah. Well, that's good. He was one of the good ones. He. used to have a box filled with mementos. uh. Tickets to the theater. little notes we'd written to each other. um. pictures of. places we planned to visit. Things like that. He came every Sunday, after Church, to see me. Okay. [music playing] [therapist] Hmm. Do you have anything you'd want to pursue? No, should I? It's. totally up to you, isn't it? It's not too late to go back to college. Or maybe pursue a romantic relationship with someone. [Jo laughs] Yeah. Like that's gonna happen. Well, um. how is Jo? - Still here? - Hm. What have you been up to? Um, I saw my mom. Oh, did you? And how is she? She's good. What did you guys talk about? Is it the Fourth of July, today? Yeah. I think it is. You know uh. I've never seen fireworks. What? Yeah. You wanna go? No. It's crowded. Don't be a weirdo. And hot. Oh. come on. Come on, Claire, please. Please, please. Please, please. Please, please. Please, please. Claire, come on. Please, please. Okay, okay, okay, we'll go. - Really? - Yes, really. - Yes? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. Should've brought flowers. [footsteps approaching] [grunting] Oh, God. Somebody's excited. Yes. Yes, I am. You know what? Just do this. [clicks tongue] Yeah. That's it. - Hi. - Hey. I've a huge favor to ask. - Oh, no. - Okay. Can you watch Lily? - No, we're going out. - I can't. I have plans. It'll only be for an hour, so. No, I don't think that'll be a good idea. I got called in to work for an emergency and Angie's at the restaurant. This is not happening. I'm s. s. sorry. Maybe you should go home. All right. I'll do it. Thank you. - Does Angie know? - Claire! Of course. I'll be back soon. I want you to behave for your Aunt, okay? Thanks. How you play is, if someone has a six and they have. or they have another card If someone lays down, they could take that card and give it to someone and then, if they don't have it, they have to go fish. So, what card do you have? Like, if you had a six, you could give it to me. A six? I don't have a six. - Then, I'll go fish. - Oh. Okay, game's over. Let's go. Jo, you know we can't go. Where were you going to go? Going to the fireworks' festival. Have you ever seen the fireworks? Oh, so Claire. Claire, seriously, why don't we go? Lily, would love to go. We can go. We can go and have fun. Come on. Who can say no to these faces? [music playing] [all screaming] [music slows and stops] [fireworks exploding] [music playing] [fireworks continue] Where were you? You okay? Where were you? I went to see the fireworks. Oh, that's not right. Get in the car, please. Take her to the car. Look, I'm sorry. Told Rich I had plans. How could. how could you do this? Did it not even cross your mind that you might be dangerous? What? You of all people. you should know. we grew up in the same house. It's not like that. And you can act like this is because of Jo? Because you left years ago. What did Dad do to deserve that? He was selfish. He was selfish. He was in the same imaginary world as the rest of you. And she almost died because of it. I found Mom, Claire. Before it was too late. I found her. Not Dad. I do not want that to happen to my little girl. I'm not Mom. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. ["That haunting melody" plays] I don't wanna leave my kids away. I've never seen you before. Get out of here. No, no. [footsteps running] Ah. Oh, no. No. Aah. I didn't want. Jo, go away. Jo, please. Please get out. Okay. Okay. [door opens] [whining] [thunder rumbling] Shit. [bottles clattering] [sighs] [sighs] [Therapist] How are you feeling, Claire? Has anything changed since we last spoke? [guitar music playing] The buyers were hesitant and. they were talking about turning it into something other than a bookstore. which I didn't like. So. I thought maybe it's time for a change. I could get out of the restaurant business. Be my own boss. And we could spend more time together. At least until we get the logistics sorted out. Maybe in the meantime, we. try to keep you from breaking anything. I made out a little 'do not touch' sign for the. typewriter. [sighs] Just kidding. Are we okay? Yeah, we're okay. Great. So I'll see you at the bookstore. Yeah. Okay. [footsteps going away] [engine revving] [birds chirping] [children chattering] Kismet Once upon a time when old Baghdad was new and shiny, there was a beggar and what a rascal! He called himself the king of beggars. Having convinced himself that he was a king of some kind, He'd roam the streets at night seeking adventure disguised as a prince. In a great palace in the city lived a great lady. A beautiful lady. And she had quite a time with this prince. Of course, she didn't know that he was only a beggar. Her lord and master was the Grand Vizier. A very powerful man. When you know him better, you won't wonder that she wandered. On the throne sat the young caliph, ruler of this great empire. But he was not content to sit and rule. He wanted the truth about his kingdom and his people. And to learn the truth, he also roamed the streets of Baghdad at night disguised as a gardener's son. And one day in this disguise, he met his fate. And adorable maid. And who do you think she was? None other than the daughter of that rascal, the king of beggars. Here is the fabulous old city. Let's cross the river with this caravan right into the exotic heart of romantic, fantastic Baghdad. A caravan! Look, a whole dinar. Dinar, bah. Pigeon food. Look here comes the feed for elephants. Round is the moon. 'Round goes the moon. The wind and the rain and the moon 'round again. Halt, the magical great of the earth. Here's a creature who will talk thy mother-in-law to death. She puts on her best feathers, and comes from nowhere only to greet nobility. A thousand blessings, my benefactor. May the golden cupboards of the water of life be open to thee. Alms for the love. The stench of my soul increases from dawn to dawn. Alms for the love of Allah. Hurry, hurry, the buzzards are waiting for thee. Look, the rich dervish miser. Not one dinar from him in twenty years. I've been much too patient with him. Get away from there, mongrel. One moment, kind merchant, in the name of Allah. Must the poor give away their blessings forever, oh great of heart? Out of my way, beggar. But this small boy looks hungry. A little compassion. Put that back. As thou sayest. Let the little boy starve. What, already hatched? How time flies. Give me that. - Very well, my friend, very well. - No, give it to me. All right, all right, but don't let it fall. You know how young it is. It's just a baby. How did the donkey's ear lay an egg? You're holding up the caravan. Out of the way. A thousand pardons, kind merchant. .Alms for the love of Allah. Did you see that? That thief. Sharp eyes, sharp ears, very useful. Gold? An embarrassment of riches. Fate has been very kind. Tonight I shall celebrate. Moolah, take my place. Moolah you can extract from the caravan. Watch him, Feisal. See he doesn't fall asleep. You're not leaving with all these fine pickings?. I have a rendezvous. Scum! To the caliph I may be dirt but to dirt, I am the caliph. Salam, dirt. What are you doing up there, old cactus? Looking for a sweetheart? Never you do that again. Marsinah. - My little lotus bud. - Good evening, father. Open your pretty lips, my little dove. - Delicious. - And why not, my pigeon? It's mixed with sugar and vinegar like the good and bad things in life. Rose water to give it perfume, and sweet seeds for flavor. And it's all put together by honey bees I have working for you in a corner of the caliph's garden. A special flock of bees? Very special. - And look what I'm making for you. - Mm, delicious. I thought you might come home late and be ravenously hungry. What a pity. I must go to a banquet tonight. Again? Again? As king of the world of magic, I'm very much in demand. How is this little hand going to look when you grow up and marry the prince I promised you? Maybe he'll be hungry sometime. Your prince is never hungry. A little thirsty but never hungry. I have a confession, father. Let's have it. I promised Karsha I would tell you. I was looking over the wall without my veil. That's why Karsha was on the ladder trying to see what I was looking at. Outside those wall, my blossom, is a very ugly world. Except in a palace of your own. That's why I built the wall around you. Leave it there. Until your prince comes to batter it down and carry you off to a world as lovely as you are. The fairy tale always comes true. Never forget that, my little princess. Now, I must dress for the feast. Sorry, kitties, but he's going out with royalty tonight. Thank you, my beauty. Let me see how you look. Oh, beautiful. Now that you have me beautiful, off to bed with you and get your beauty sleep. Blessings, my rose, sleep well. I've hung a lovely moon in the sky for you. Sometimes the old moon keeps me awake. Turn your pretty little nose into the pillow or I'll come up and blow out the moon. - Bah! - Huh? I said, Bah! That's all I've heard you say in thirty years. One of these days, I'll say more than that. Police, guards, police. Police? I don't see any police. What are you fighting for on a night like this? I called them liars. They were liars. So's everybody. Not when you make them lose their jeppers. Then they tell you the truth. - Is that what you want? - Yes, I want the truth. Truth, my friend, is boredom. Maybe so but it's exciting and worth fighting for. Give me a man who laughs when he fights. - Come and have some wine. - Thanks, I will. Hey, Prince. Don't expect the truth from anyone here. They're charming people. They don't bother with it. Charming people? They look like a bunch of back alley merchants and cutthroats to me. To you? My friend, they are all nobility. I don't recognize any of them. How should a young elephant like you recognize nobility? I go to all the parades. Excellency, I have a place for you. Salam, ladies. I won't tell you their names but they're all queens in disguise. Magic black eyes. Take one look and turn away. They're dangerous. Don't worry. He told me I was the only girl in Baghdad. So you are, my blossom. Hardy young antelope I've fell in with. What draggle tail part of the city do you come from? Mind if I choose for myself? Save me Laeida? She is not in yet. Drink some wine. In a few minutes, you'll see a young beauty worth fighting for. I hope I can agree with you. Agree with me? - The insolence. - I'm sorry. My friend, if she weren't a lovely sight to behold, she wouldn't be coming here for an evening with me. Oh? Well, might I ask just who you are? Keep it to yourself. One of the princes of the empire. I sit in the counsels of the caliph. Oh. You do? Then you know the new caliph. Tell me, what's he like? The new caliph is a yahoo. A yahoo? His father left him a score of lovely ladies. And what does the young gander do? He turns them loose. Bah! Heart of a king should be big enough for all the women in the world. If a king can't act like a king, he's a yahoo. He doesn't tell you what to do about the ladies, does he? My friend, No one has to tell me what to do with the ladies. You're sitting with the master. Oh, magic. And very handy in case of trouble. You must see this. <i>I have secured a new meeting place -</i> <i>a tower by the river. Come at once.</i> <i>Hassan will guide you. Jamilla</i> Bad news? On the contrary. It's from a queen. I haven't seen her for.Oh, it's been much too long. What about Lady Laeida? Oh, she's late. You'll have to take what's left. She might even like you. Thank you. Farewell, my friend. Say to the Lady Laeida, urgent matters call me. Why didn't you wait for Laeida? I have a rendezvous of my own. Does the master approve? Is she beautiful? - The sweetest girl in Baghdad. - Magnificent. Where? In a boat tied up to a cypress tree. Boat, romance in a bouncing boat. Go away. Spoil the night for someone else. Never let tomorrow break the spell. And when autumn breezes hear our sighs, may our lips never say fare thee well. Keep him near, never far. Never leave, evening star. His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir. He's not the Prince of Hassir. He's only the prince of liars. But charming. You may show him in. You may enter. ..and when autumn breezes hear our sighs .may our lips never say. Jamilla, Lady of the Moonlight. So we meet again, my prince. Let me feast my eyes on you. It really is you. This is a pleasure. I've tried giving you up. How could anything so beautiful be so merciless, so cruel? We have a week of delirious happiness and suddenly you're gone. My nights are sleepless, my days burning sands. I didn't know who you were, where you were. I shouted the name Jamilla through every palace window. From Tehran to Mosul. There wasn't even an echo. Finally, I take the long journey home to Hassir eh my own little kingdom praying for a thunderbolt to explode you out of my heart. But no thunderbolt. Charming. I ride home. I am desolate. In my palace, I have a corner I call the Garden of the Stars. I like that. There I sat night after night. And with my astrologers. A very stupid lot. They don't know anything about women. But you do, my prince. There never was another woman in all the world I couldn't forget but you. You weren't looking for me in that cafe where they found you. But how fortunate I was there. It was the hand of fate. Kiss me. - Kiss? - What else? I stopped a fight in the street. I took a poor old battered lad inside and washed the blood off him. A foul, reeking place, yes, but I. I couldn't leave him in the street, could I? And you couldn't keep Laeida waiting, could you? How could you profane this moment with chatter like that? After the torture you've made me endure. Adorable man, don't stop. Don't ever stop. I'd rather listen to you telling lies than to all the wise men with all the truth of the ages. Beard of my ancestor! No one calls me a liar with impunity. Who are you, Lady of the Moonlight? I must know. You'll never escape me again. I warn you to leave things as they are, prince. I never leave things as they are. The night is enchanting. Have you ever been on the river when the moon is like this? The river has romance from here. Let it be. That young lout I told you about. Yes, you washed the blood off him. He has a boat under a cypress tree. They're possibly cripples by now. My boat was built for the queen of Sheba. Is it written that Solomon never went fishing with her at night? What are you thinking? Nothing. Just listening. So soft and so lovely. Isn't your life always soft and lovely? I don't know. I've never lived before. Who built the high wall around you? My father. Why? To keep everybody out. To keep me inside. Is no one ever going to be allowed inside? Oh, yes. The prince I'm going to marry someday will batter the walls down. I'd batter the walls down but I'm only a gardener's son. That's why I'm laughing. Where is this prince supposed to come form? Kismet, my fate. Where else? You believe in fate, don't you? I do indeed. My father thinks he can give romance to fate. I want a prince for my daughter and nothing else will do. You've never told me much about your father. If I said he was a beggar, then you'd think he was a beggar. No I'm not. He's the king of beggars. He's a king of some kind. Or he couldn't be your father. If he ever knew the wall wasn't high enough. He'd kill me. No, darling, nobody's going to kill you. If he knew I'd been kissed by a gardener's son. Oh, well. The moon is almost gone. Take me home now, please. - You wicked. - Oh, Karsha. Is this the first time? Allah, look down. I'm in love, Karsha. Love with some poverty stricken camel boy? Your father would kill you. But you're not going to tell him. Swear to me me you'll never do this again or I will tell him. Did you make such promises when you were in love, Karsha? Go to bed, you. Besides, if you tell father, he'll cut both our throats. You get to bed. You ought to be too ashamed to draw a breath much less sing. There's no room in my heart for shame. Who is this young creature anyhow? Isn't he wonderful? He can jump but who is he? He's a gardener's son. Salt of the world, a gardener's son! Wait, his father's chief gardener of the palace, the caliph's gardener. - What gets you up so early? - I'm not up so early. - No? - No. I haven't been to bed. Ah, come, my friend, I. If I'm your friend, why don't.what's that? Brawling again. Why don't you stop it? I've prowled mt last prowl. I've found what I've been looking for. All thanks to Allah. So from now on, you can sleep in peace. - You found what? - I found a queen. And such a queen. What eyes! The kind our poets call deep pools. Always thought they were crazy before now, but they're not. I suppose queens do play around the streets of Baghdad at night. Oh no, not this one. I had to leap a high wall for my queen. And here's something to make you more cheerful. I want you to get in touch with our astrologers and tell them this is a wonderful day for a wedding. And don't you let them tell you it isn't. Wedding? Who is she? What's the difference? I know what she is. Her name's Marsinah. Good name, isn't it? What about her family? And her father. Who is he? If I told you he's a beggar, you'd think he's a beggar. He's the king of beggars. Are you serious? Very serious. King of beggars. You'll have to conjure up some new title for this king of beggars. But tell me more about the girl. She's a queen, my friend. Heart of a queen, mind of a queen, soul of a queen. I suppose she has a body. Ravishing, my friend, ravishing. Well, you didn't mention the body first. That's promising. Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day. - Long life and great happiness. - Thank you. I'd better call off the parade to the mosque. Oh no, we can't do that. That would disappoint my people. But the court's this afternoon. We'll have to dispense with that. That would disappoint the Grand Vizier. What's the matter? You look worried. I am, very much worried. You committed a blunder yesterday. - A very serious blunder. - Did I? Name of Allah! You summoned the Grand Vizier of Baghdad to court like a common thief. A thief's a thief. But he's the most powerful man in the empire. My father let this jackal skin people alive. Taxes, tributes, plain robbery. And I'm going to stop it. But he hasn't even acknowledged your summons. He'll laugh at you. And he won't come. He'll come. Or I'll go get him myself. And like doing it. I can only repeat that he is the most powerful man in the empire. Achmed. Let me have this. I want to keep it. Her head was resting on your shoulder. For the empire and her, I will do my best. And nothing on earth will stop me. That was spoken like a king. And why not? If a king isn't a king, he's just a yahoo. Yahoo? What is a yahoo? You won't find that word in books, Agha. Blessings of the Prophet on this day of days. This brand new caliph, this presumptuous peacock, has the gall to summon me to open court. When he stands before the mosque today, I want you to send an arrow through his heart. But see that the arrow flies straight. Yes, milord. If you fail, your head will come off. I will not fail, milord. That will be the shortest career any caliph ever had in Baghdad. - Good morning, father. - Ah, my little lotus. Fresh from the hills. The dew is still on them. I waited for the sun to open them up. Enchanting! - Aren't they gorgeous. - Go on with you sining. And how is my little nightingale this morning? - In good voice? - Too good. What's troubling my little Marsinah? She's not in the mood for learning. My mind is wandering this morning. I'm sorry. Why not? Everyone's mind should wander on a morning like this. I knew you'd understand, father. And today, I am not your father. Today I am the shah of Molla Bashi. Bah! And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, your excellency? Word of thy beauty is blowing down the wind. I am here to offer gifts at your feet. It's lovely. Where did you get it? I never remember where I get anything. Now, you sing for me. Very well. Bah! Tell me, tell me little evening star, is this world as lovely as it seems. Did some magic carpet from afar bring this love to the land of my dreams? Keep your light forever in his eyes. Never let tomorrow break the spell. And when autumn breezes hear us sigh, - Did you teach her to sing that song? - I did not. .lips never say fare thee well. Where did that song come from? How do I know? I dreamed songs like that at her age. - Where did she learn it? - I don't know. Something's happened. Who is it? What is it? If there's any trouble, there's no one to blame but you. You brought her up on fairy tales. You made fantastic promises. Built walls around her then went roaring through Baghdad and forgot about her. Forgot? You can't forget her any longer. Do you think she's going to wither away waiting for your fairy tales to come true? She's waiting for her fate and all its splendor. The fate for a beggar's daughter is a camel boy. Silence, misery. Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud. They're the only things in the world that come true. Alms for the love. What's wrong with him? Oh, him. He worries me. Alms for the love of Allah. Everybody's in a gay and festive mood and you sit here. What ails you? Guess the rendezvous must have made him sick. Maybe he drank too much. I never thought I'd have a problem and no answer for it. - He has a problem. - What's that? Oh. One of those things. I never thought you'd have a problem. I know the answer. Don't worry. For a dozen years I made golden promises to my little girl. Suddenly she's not a baby anymore. What about the golden promises? A prince and nothing less. A handsome prince, fabulously rich. I spread a carpet of dreams before her. This morning, I'm just a beggar. Princes live in another world. My rose will bloom for some camel boy. He'll never know how sweet she is. I guess he has been drinking too much. It's the Caliph. That man will never make another attempt of the kind. I made sure of that. Also, he can't answer any questions, can he? Dead men tell no tales. Feisal. What was that gossip of yours about the big people? About the Grand Vizier. He was invited to the court like any criminal. That's what I said. I think he just replied to the invitation. He came within inches of being ruler of the empire. I could tie my chariot to such a star. - Lord of the Grand Illusion. - Or we just do nothing. There's only one place for the loveliest of daughters. The household of the greatest of men. The Grand Vizier? You're closer to him today than you will be in a thousand years. Now, by the glories of Paradise to come, Allah hath opened the gate of action to me. Lead me to a bazaar where they trade in royal silks. Jewels from India, beads from Damascus, sashes from Constantinople, turban cloth from Vocarra. My Marsinah was born to make a palace dance. Allah, save us. That, my friends, is the golden promise of a king, and the word of a king is good. Water, water, it's good. I never knew it was like that. Feisal, my friend, you have a face. Yeah well, I had a bath. Say, Bobo, why are we hiding here in a public bathing place? Don't worry. This is one place they'd never look for us. - No? - Police, police! Police, police! They're here, the police. They're here. Why not police? There was an attempt on the caliph's life this morning. They're looking for accomplices everywhere. Attendant. Attendant. Yes? Yes, your highness. One of my men tells me the police are here. They're looking for a beggar for robbery. Tell the captain I wish a word with him. - At once. - What? There's a wise proverb: Seize the horns of the charging bull. Your highness, the captain of police. Why do you enter a place where weary travellers relax? Must the peace of the hammam be disturbed? - It's a matter of duty. - Duty? In my country, I allow no such impertinence. What duty? We are looking for a thief. Must have stolen the sacred jewels. No, milord. Apparel of great value. Trinkets a rat steals and a captain becomes a ferret? In my country my captains don't annoy visiting royalty chasing petty thieves. Look int he yard. See if my elephant is still there. Your highness, I did not know. You didn't know. What's happened to Baghdad? My last visit here, eleven years ago, when I was a day's journey away, the police of Baghdad knew I was coming. Your highness, no elephant. By the dried skin of the hyena. Have I come a thousand parasangs to visit the Grand Vizier only to be robbed? I demand safe conduct. and another elephant. If your soul isn't too weasel to stop this rat catching, send a messenger to Mansur's palace. And say the Prince of Hassir has arrived with toot sweet. On matters of great importance. Very well, you shall have your escort and you shall have your elephant. But now. - I want privacy. - Very good, your highness. Is that carpet for us? No, that's for the elephant. Tell the merchant the tax is direct. Unless they pay it immediately, it will be my personal pleasure to roll their heads through their bazaar. What do you want? How large a guard shall I prepare for your visit to the royal court? You should know better than that, captain. - But, milord. - Forget the summons to court. This young peacock is beginning to spread his tail. He just might send the police after me. It'll give him a chance to find out I'm the police. What is it? His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir. Hassir, Hassir? He must come from the far ends of the world. That's the farthest corner of the empire, my lord. Did he send a messenger for an appointment? No, milord. These heathens have customs but no manners. Yes, milord. Let's give him a royal reception. Let's amaze him with it. I wonder what this barbarian wants to have travelled so far. His royal highness, the Prince of Hassir. I'll wager he's been preparing a long speech all the way across the desert. A long, horrible speech. Welcome, your highness. A wide brow proclaims an open heart. May heaven trust me, your lordship. I never ask prosperity where it comes from. Right, milord. The devil could do you a good turn now and then. That they may be seated. I have a contemptibly small gift. My caravan is delayed. So if you will accept this in the meantime, I would be most honored. This is exquisite. This is really fine. - Good hands made this. - Very young hands. Is the design a copy? Copy, milord? It's a creation. She did all of it. She? It's a gift from the loveliest girl in Hassir. Perhaps in the empire. If I guess right, there's a mission you want me to perform. - Is there, milord? - Yes. You want me to propose the lovely young girl for the caliph's household. Milord. But you've come at a very bad moment. The caliph does not love me as he should. At the moment. Milord. If I wish to visit the caliph, I will visit the caliph. Splendid, splendid, your gift honors me. Will your highness honor me by accepting eh. These? I am overwhelmed, your lordship. Alfife. The living isn't very good on the journey from Hassir to Baghdad, is it? I once knew a magician in your province. His name was Abdul Laka. How is he? The one with a beard like a field of ripe corn? No, no, no, he had a short eh. scruffy wisp of a beard. Oh, that Abdul. The brigand. He stole so brazenly, my executioners had to cut his hands off. - No. - Bled to death in public. That should teach him a lesson. Let's drink to poor Abdul. We have the finest wine, music and dancing. Dancing? You like dancing? It's the flowers on the mountaintop. Then you're about to see the finest in the kingdom. I have scores of them. My kind of dancers don't come in scores. - No? - No. I'll wager you haven't anything like this in your pastures. The girl who made you the gift makes these look like swamphens. Swamphens? These girls were selected from every royal house in the empire. Milord, my little girl would be a queen among these. Great dancing takes brains and heart. Alfife. I have a great dancer. She has brains but no heart. Say to her gracious majesty I have a distinguished visitor. The prestige of my court is sinking. Say that I am pleading that she save the glory of the court. Your ladyship? Well? I'm commanded to request that you appear in the hall of the white columns and dance. I'm very sorry. I'm not in the mood for dancing. But it is for a distinguished guest. Must I call Hassan? We've been robbed, lord. Alfife, one moment, please. The royal merchants have been robbed. They want justice. Tell them to wait. I have troubles enough. Quiet, quiet. Her ladyship is not in the mood. Salt of my ancestors! A man who cracks a whip over an empire. If I cracked a whip over this lady, she'd take it right out of my hands. It takes a great man to admit it. She's a gift from Macedonia. I can't offend Macedonia. That sounds more like the caliph than your lordship. Well, upon my soul! You all stay. Watch the dancing and have some wine. Why do you continue to deprive us of the pleasure of your incomparable dancing? Didn't Alfife tell you? Doesn't the look of desperation in my eyes soften your mood just a little? I'm in a very pleasant mood. Very. I have a charming and distinguished guest. It's your luck that he pleases you. Pleases me? He scorns my dancing girls as swamphens. Oh, a man of judgement. Lady Jamilla, I have granted you exceptional privileges. You granted nothing. You have an agreement with Macedonia that I should do that thing. And you have agreed never to come to this tower except at my invitation. I'm waiting patiently for the invitation. And as far as dancing is concerned. You have ladies who dance when you strike the gong. I don't. But, Lady Jamilla. I give your lordship my answer politely. It's outrageous hospitality. He's had a long hard journey and we mustn't disappoint the Prince of Hassir. The Prince of Hassir? Now, don't try to trick me. There's no such thing under the sun as the Prince of Hassir. I'm absolutely certain. There's no such man. There's nothing more to be said. Some day I'm going to cut your head off even if I lose Macedonia. Hassan has something important to tell you. Hassan? I'll see him. She says there is no Prince of Hassir. Lady of the Moonlight. Lady of the what? Well, she came down from some celestial spot. She didn't come down. She came up. Marvelous. Pity custom forbids my telling her so. We are bigger than our customs. Tell her so. Don't be afraid. She doesn't bite strangers. Your lordship is great indeed. Lady of the Moonlight. You are ravishing. I warned you to leave things as they were. How could you do this terrible thing to me? What have I done? When you said you shouted my name in the windows of all the palaces, I knew it was nonsense but I loved it. To me, you were all the romance of old Baghdad. When I was bored to exhaustion, I could escape and find you. You were priceless. Jamilla, listen to me. No, no, no. This is farewell, my friend. What a shame. I am just as much the Prince of Hassir as I ever was. As much, no more. You're a charming liar at times. Don't be absurd. The Grand Vizier doesn't roll out the red carpet for stray vagabonds. When my royal blood is up, no one can deny me. And no one does. Nothing has changed. You mean you hoaxed your way in here? This is magnificent. You took your life in your hands to see me. A poor risk for such a reward. Then I must see you tonight. You must tell me all about this before you forget any of it. What you said, every word. What the great man said. Oh, this is wonderful! I'll laugh in his face every time I look at him. You'll never laugh in his face again. We're leaving tonight you and I for my Garden of the Stars. If you will accept this little gift, beautiful dancer, it may remind you of the pleasure you gave a weary traveller. You're too gracious, your highness. Well? Well. She's a great artist, milord. Then we'll hear no more about the maid of Hassir. Of course, she's much younger. But she's queen of them all. You're not suggesting I get rid of Jamilla? No, no, no, my lord. But of course, fate moves queens into place and out again so. You never can tell. We're too shaking with Macedonia right now, aren't we? I didn't come here to give you the shakes. I just wanted you to see the girl, that's all. To see her dance. And when she sings, my lord, the angels are still. In the name of the seven burning lakes, do you expect me to travel all the way to Hassir to see this paragon? No, she's here with me in Baghdad. Then before you start singing her praises all over again, I'll send for her in state. That's something I must do myself, if you don't mind. No, anything you want, of course. The superlative hand that fashioned the gift shall have something from me. Here. Give this to the miracle of all girls and say to her that never before in it's history has this palace held its breath as it does now. And what's her name? - Marsinah. - Marsinah. And now gentlemen, to the Princess Marsinah. This needlework! What material! I poured all my love into it. Oh, Karsha. I like it myself. Listen. Listen. Oh, he sounds happy. Sounds like an extra glass of wine or a new fairy tale. Here, you come take that off. That's not for everyday. Please, Karsha, I want father to see it. Ah, my blossoming flower, greetings, my unblossoming cactus. Salam, salam, salam. Happiness. Where did you get it? To those of royal blood, one never asks, "Where did you get it?" Those pearls. Gorgeous. Who was it said every son's a blessing, every daughter a desolation? Who'd dare say anything so wicked? I wouldn't barter you this day for all the sons of all the guardians, all the nobles or. am I talking like a king? Who went crazy. Silence, cactus. Or I'll call my slaves to chop your head off. How would my little princess like to live in a palace? With pillows of ostrich plumes, in courts of marble with ceilings of molten gold. She'd go blind in the eye, enslaved. To bring on the feast. Come on, slave, the feast. Ha, quiet. Your wishes, princess? I shall have a sherbert. In my costliest china bowl. With exquisite spoons made from the pear tree. Here is pheasant from Mazanderland. Here are the choicest bites of the wild antelope. I get the bellyache just listening to them. So, I go roaring through Baghdad, do I? Such a roar was never heard through Baghdad. Please, father, tell me what did you do? I have had wine with the greatest man in Arabia. Wine, music, he even brought out his dancing girls. I looked at them, I thought of you. Milord, I said, these are swamphens. He said, "Off with his head." I said, "Wait", said I, "Wait." Not until you've seen the Princess Marsinah and so. He sends you this. With his compliments. Now, my lotus, my little pigeon, you are to dance for the Grand Vizier! I? I dance for the Grand Vizier? I promised you when the time came, a king should bow his turban to the dust for you. All day your father has been stepping from one mountain peak to another. But don't be uneasy, my little Marsinah. You'll dazzle them all. Open up in the name of justice. This way, quick! In here, both of you. Quick! The police, police. - I knew they wouldn't be far behind you. - Stay there. - The robber.- The rascal.- That's my tunic - My shoes.- My ring.- My turban. - He stole my purse. - Quiet. They're lying dogs, captain. These clothes in this shack? These clothes are mine and those too. You can have them back. Here. Come along, you're under arrest. Alfife, this is an outrage. I'm a man of religion and peace. Three doomsday break if I lie. Father. I'll be back, my little one. Don't worry. I'll see my friend, the Grand Vizier. He'll send them all where they belong. Come along. I knew it. I knew it. Karsha. - Karsha. - Come, my little one. No, no, I must get help. The king of beggars. - Gardener? - Yes? - What is it? - This young lady wants to see you. Wants to see me? Yes, please. A flower from the caliph's garden. Is that what she was? Here. Thank you. That has a blessing. Where can I find your son? My son? This garden is the only wife I ever had. Thousands of these flowers are my only children. Oh, see what you've done. Forgive me. Milord. My friend, I didn't believe it when they told me. I've seen princes made and unmade pretty fast in my time. But never with a speed like this. Go ahead. The accusers may speak one at a time. Quiet. I have heard the accusations. And what has his highness of Hassir to say? And what of the magician? Can he juggle his way out of this? Come, speak. Milord, when the trick fails, when it's exposed, the magician's a poor thing. The other gift, the bracelet you gave the princess, milord. Oh, no, hang it around your neck again. I did enjoy you. You surprised a man pretty hard to surprise. And you remember poor Abdul? Yes. You know the law. If a man steals, you cut off his hands in front of his victims. My hands! Actually, you'll cut my heart out. If a man knows the law, he should think of that before he steals Milord! It is no pleasure to see rare talent cut off before its time. But it is so written in the law. There can be no compromise. What is it? A message from the imperial palace. I have come from the all highest of the center of the universe to give his compliments to you. He has sent a very substantial number of his royal guard. His serene highness is thus assured that you will be conducted to his presence in a manner befitting your exulted position and the distinction of your house. Did you say royal guard? By the express orders of the caliph. Your palace is now completely surrounded by your escort. Milord. Milord, shall we proceed? What are we waiting for? Cut off his hands and dismiss the court. Milord, wait, these hands can serve you. Silence, mountebank. But I can tell you of my master in Morocco. He toppled the king off the throne. When everything else had failed. Halt. My friend, your story will have to be exceedingly good. Or it will be exceedingly short. It's both, milord. It's good and short. But. I need my hands to tell it. And now, what did your master of Morocco do? While the king was amazed at the lightning in one hand, the other drove a dagger through his heart. Proceed. I heard the king's messenger. The words sounded fair but. Your lordship is trapped. Before the mosque this morning, a mans' head rolled in the gutter. He'd fumbled his job. You told me yourself how much the caliph loved you. Of course, you know you've just written your death warrant. Unless I can serve you. What you want done in Baghdad today, only these hands can do. Get me before the king today and you will rule the empire by sundown. - You have courage, my friend. - I have for this, milord. I'm keeping a golden promise. I'd rather die than break it. - A promise to whom? - To my daughter, milord. Dear to me beyond the hopes of Paradise. The highest place in the world I've promised her since she was a baby. If you serve me today, I'll make you a prince of Islam, and she can have anything she wants. If I send this peacock to Paradise one split second later, I'll be dead. You risk that, of course. Now, what do you want? This and it must be done rapidly. My Marsinah brought here in state. I must see her installed not as one of your dancers but as queen. As head of your household. But what about the tiger cat? Leave the tiger cat to me. Another assignment in magic? You met the lady for only a brief moment. It was love at first sight, milord. I can always tell. Very well, my friend, very well. Your princess Marsinah shall be brought here in state. And now some wine. That means good things. Like a bursting sunrise. You've heard many fables, child. But the sands never lie. What's that? Have you risen from the dead? Marsinah, my child, there's nothing to be distressed about. A word to my friend, the Grand Vizier, and those hounds went off yelping. Tears, my poor baby? Has this croaking old parchment frightened you? I've good news for you. The greatest of all news. You are to be queen of the household of the Grand Vizier. Think of it. The Princess Marsinah. Not just one of a score of dancing girls. But queen of them all. Don't lie to her anymore. I do not lie, cactus. Before the sun goes down, she'll be the greatest lady in Baghdad. - Why must you make life so horrible? - Marsinah, it is written. I love you, father, but I can't obey. What's this? What's happened? She's fallen in love. That's what's happened. Who? When? I'll send him floating down the river without his head. Where is he? He told her his father's the royal gardener but he lied. The royal gardener has no son. I want to put you on the mountaintop but you choose the gutter. Don't you see how miserable I am? My little Marsinah, I built these walls to protect you. Every day of your life, I've tried to bring a world of dream in here. And now those dreams are coming true. I know what life with the gardener's son will mean. Slavery, poverty, ugliness. A few short years and life will be over. That's not true. Leave me alone. - Captain of the guard. - Father. Bring them in. Don't make me do this. For this I've risked my life a dozen times today. For this I descended a bottomless pit. The bargain is made. You mean I. I'm to marry a. I'm giving you the place in the sun I promised you. Deliver this maid to the Grand Vizier. They don't have to touch me. I'll go. When will she arrive? Just before sunset. After the gardener's son has battered the wall down. The messenger has returned. You may speak. You majesty, this beggar we've been searching for seems to have vanished. Ridiculous. Beggars don't vanish from Baghdad. He must be found and found today. In your search, did you learn anything about him? He calls himself king of beggars. He masquerades at night as the Prince of Hassir. He is also quite a magician. Double your efforts. Set a watch around the house where he lives. You may go. You're not serious about this wedding after what you've just heard? Nothing can change my mind. I shall bring her here myself. In the name of Destiny, you. It's insane to risk your neck in the streets. You can send a thousand men with me if you like. But the gardener's son is going to lead her through the royal gardens. I'll tell her nothing till we're here. I want the memory of this day to live in her heart forever. I'm ready, milord. Where's the princess? - She's being costumed. - Good. Your appearance in court has been arranged. The caliph has accepted your petition. And he. What are you laughing at? There's vast excitement among the ladies because of the Princess Marsinah. Her highness, Queen Jamilla, refuses to leave the tower, milord. You hear? She won't leave the tower. There's a good deal at stake. I think she'll have to. Right, but what are you going to do, put her under a spell? Exactly. As soon as you've formally dethroned her. There are formalities, milord. All right. Stay here. I'll take care of the formalities. Don't you dare come up here. Or I'll drive a dagger through your heart. But, Lady Jamilla. I shall stay in this tower as long as it pleases me. And only when I decide to leave, shall I leave. Oh, you decide. Remember I told you I would cut your throat even if I lost Macedonia. Now the time has come. - I'll call out the. - Never mind. I have decided to leave. You what? Jasmina. Marsinah. Prince Charming. Let no one make hash of fairy tales, my rosebud. Your veil, please. You should have brought a poet to talk about her. Arise, my dear. And be honored. From now on, this distinguished young lady is queen of the household. There will be a marriage ceremony later in the day. A word to your father before I lead you to the tower. Once, milord, there grew a single rose in a beggar's garden. He swore it should never bloom for some camel boy. How do you do things like this? Magician. You brought this girl here? Yes, I brought her here. So that I would be free? It was a bargain. I was going to tear the place to pieces. And I would have. If I hadn't seen you. I told you you couldn't escape me. Can a woman escape her destiny? The name of Jamilla still echos in palace windows. And the Garden of the Stars is written in the sand. I'll come back for you in an hour. Another hour here? I'm a deposed queen. Forgive me. First I've a duty to perform. It's not as simple as I thought. Was is this duty? My part of the bargain. If I live through it, I'll be here. You'll live through anything. There's a secret entrance. My slave will be looking for you. Near the eastern gate. If you don't see me within the hour, I'll be dead. You'll be alive when the man in the moon is forgotten, my beloved. The Lady of the Moonlight will be waiting. Come quickly. Did I hear you laugh? Oh, no. Why tears at this great moment? You've reached about the highest place a woman can have in this kingdom. What good is a high place if your heart breaks? We women are not supposed to have hearts, my dear. Who was he? Nobody. A gardener's son. I see. You do strange things in Hassir. Hassir? Yes, your province. I've never heard of the place. But you have been formally presented by the Prince of Hassir. I've never been out of Baghdad. But who's the man who brought you? You mean my father. - Your father? - Yes. He didn't bring me from anyplace but the shack we live in. But who is your father if he's not the prince of Hassir? My father is a beggar. A beggar? Yes, he sits on a rock before the beggar's mosque. This magnificent man a beggar. Oh, how wonderful. How wonderful! A beggar! And his daughter a queen. What fun. Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you. Come on, cheer up. Hear that? Come here. The song of ceremony for the new queen. You're supposed to sing it. I. We expect it. Sing for them. Like the willow in the wind, I have a weeping. Like the willow in the wind moaning low Like a willow leaf, love is ever brief So my heart weeps away never sleeping Weeps away like the night winds that blow Like a willow leaf Love will come to grief Only yesterday spring was here to stay The voice is good. I could do with a happier song. Youth can be sad without rhyme or reason. Now that I've signed the marriage agreement, I've fulfilled my part of the bargain. See that you don't fail to do yours. Not I, milord. If I don't juggle you out of trouble, I've done nothing for her. That's true, that's true. Alfife. Double the guard around the tower. And what's so amusing? I was thinking if I fail with the caliph, they'll kill me. If I don't then your lordship will do it. I might not. Milord, I've an inheritance. My father lived to be 100, my grandfather 110. They won't be expecting me in either place for years. They won't be ready for me. Find courage, my friend, find courage. Kismet. His lordship, the exalted Grand Vizier of Baghdad. Let every tongue be silent. His serene highness, commander of the faithful, lion of the imperial forest, rider of the spotless horse, shadow of Allah on earth, ruler of all Arabia. If it please the all highest. The ruler of faithful is not to be addressed except at his own request. As you well know. Your case is third on the list, your lordship. But to summon me here on a few hour's notice, shows contempt for my great office. In the name of dignity and high justice, I demand time to prepare myself against the accusations, no matter what they may be. I will always listen when a man says, "In the name of justice." I'll grant you the time you ask. And I'm going to tell you what you're accused of so you'll know how to prepare. But during the time I'm granting you, all duties and power of office is stripped from you. The seal is worthless. But this is outrageous. You are accused of brutal taxation, robbery of the poor, years of corruption. My witnesses are here by thousands. And I have it from their own lips throughout the kingdom. When you have an answer you think we should hear, let us know. When your serene highness apologizes to me, may I hope that he does it as publicly as this. I will not keep your fate a secret I promise you. Number one on the divan program, is the case of Alwah, the woodchopper against Wapu the barber. Which is the barber? I am the barber, your excellency, I am the barber. State your case. Great keeper of all justice, this miserable woodchopper, he pays my barbershop a visit. He inquires how much will be the charge to shave him and his friend. I stated a most reasonable price. I shaved the rascal and I said, "Now, bring in your friend." And what does he do? He brings in his ass and says, "This is my friend." Well, Alwah? Most high and just, Two moons ago, I brought to this b-barber a load of wood on the back of my friend here. He bargained for all of the wood on the ass' back. In those very words. So this hard-hearted b-barber he took also my pack saddle saying that too was made of wood. He said. Agha, have this overly smart barber shave the woodchopper's friend. The next case is a petition from a stranger. It is a tradition in Baghdad to hear strangers without delay. The man is a magician from far off Morocco. And craves assignment as conjurer to the imperial court. This magician is the beggar we've been searching the city for. The next case is your father-in-law. The Prince of Hassir? That roustabout who kicked me and called me a yahoo? My father-in-law. The heavens are having fun. Perhaps not. His petition came from the valets of the Grand Vizier. Let's be on guard. I shall not weary your serene highness. I shall conjure before the eyes of the lion of the imperial desert only such feats of magic. He's gone. He's gone. Now, oh rider of the spotless horse On my right is this beautiful young lady and here, the handsome lad she loves. but it's springtime, your highness and with your royal permission. Let me out of here! Hey, let me out of here! Let me out. Thus demonstrating to the all highest that nothing in the world is real. Excellent, excellent. And now, oh, prince of true believers, I will show you a feat so incredible it has staggered all the rulers of the world. But the king must watch closely. May a stranger beg humbly to approach? The king's eyesight is excellent. Proceed. What use if the king can't see? Proceed. Watch the kerchief closely, milord. - See amazing things it can see. - Halt! Serene highness, I am a failure. My chance is a nothing unless you examine the kerchief closely. Stay where you are. Let him come up. Allah reward thee, commander of the faithful. Before your eyes, I will produce a forest and put it on the mountaintop. I now summon the gods of thunder. - And from these changing colors. - You will produce a knife. You showed me the trick last night. Remember the yahoo? Don't kill him. Bring him to me. Bring him to me. I want silence. Let every tongue be silent. This is the second attempt today. It is clear life is in the hands of fate. Praise Allah. Before this fool's execution, I want him to hear something. You were told of a royal wedding today. That wedding will still take place. I've combed the corners of Baghdad for this man. And while he was plotting with my enemies, I was arranging to make his daughter queen of the empire. That girl must disappear immediately. The Grand Vizier, stop him. Stop him. Don't let him get away. - Don't worry about him. - Don't let the Grand Vizier get away. Our chancellor will now give you the order of the day. - Proceed. - Guards, get him! Where's Marsinah? She goes with us. Quick, lead the way. Come back, you fool. He'll kill you. Admit no one until we get the beggar's daughter out of here. And his highness can try and find us in the wilderness of the desert. We'll soon find out who rules in Baghdad. Marsinah. Marsinah. Here's the key. Let me open it. Marsinah. The Grand Vizier. Where's the girl? Where is she? Alfife, call the guards. Alfife, the guards! Alfife. He died laughing, Excellency. We'll see if you can do the same. I've heard enough. Bring him in. Yes, the most beautiful pearl in my entire kingdom. Release him. You may rise. What have you to say? Your highness, You expect to be hanged, of course? Thou art the lord of my neck. Hanging is much to easy a punishment for you. Milord, torture? You love Baghdad, don't you? With the breath of my life, milord. Rather a dead beggar in Baghdad than a living monarch of the wilderness. Have you ever seen Hassir? Hassir is the dullest, drowsiest, most desolate corner of the empire. So. You're exiled. To Hassir. And if you're in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last. Exiled? From Baghdad? - Oh, milord, bring on the hangman. - Silence! From this moment, you are our Prince of Hassir. Prince of Hassir? You had a lot of fun being Prince of Hassir. Oh, most exalted, I will make this forgotten spot into a paradise. The desert shall blossom like the rose. The odor of decay will vanish before a breeze of orange blossoms. There will thy name be honored. Yes, but if you're caught in Baghdad one second after sundown, that second will be your last. They're coming, Jamilla. Karsha. He's coming, Karsha! Jamilla! Marsinah! Father. Marsinah. Father. You're alive? Yes and so are all my promises. Round is the moon, 'round goes the moon, the wind and the rain to the moon 'round again, Karsha. Father, it's the gardener's son. But why do you kneel? It's the revered one, the rider of the spotless horse. The Caliph of Baghdad himself. The ruler of all Arabia. Why, it. Marsinah. Now, say goodbye to your father. Father. My baby. Blessings of the Prophet on your wedding day, my little one. Your highness, the sun goes down. Your wedding gift, my lotus. And may Allah smile on you both forever. Look. Well, it's. It's the most beautiful pearl I've ever seen. Hurry up, man. I thought you were lost. All Baghdad Well, wishes are horses. Beggars can ride. The daughter of a beggar The daughter of a king. Farewell, Baghdad. If you're ever again in trouble, send for me. Sundown, your highness. This way. THE LADIES OF THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE I haven't shown you a very good time. You're suffering. I know I annoy you, but I'm your oldest friend. Though you keep silent, I must speak. Héléne, you have sacrificed everything for a man who no longer loves you. Jean and I adore each other. You know very well what I mean. Observe him as I observe you. There is no such thing as love, only proofs of love. Our happiness disturbs our friends. I'm sorry, but I'm happy. I only wanted to warn you, because I love you with all my heart. Good night,Jacques. The play was long and I'm exhausted. Good night. Jean! You frightened me. I rushed over to apologize for forgetting so stupidly. Such a thing doesn't matter between us. I'm tired. I completely forgot I was to dine with you tonight. I have no excuse. It's unforgivable. Do you like this case? I love gold. It's like you. warm, cold, light, dark. incorruptible. What a beautiful gift! Thank you. It was your anniversary gift. You would have found it at your seat. Anniversary? It was two years ago that we decided to live for each other. What a monster I am! Don't be so hard on yourself. We all have something to blame ourselves for. Even you? Even me. Tell me. It might be better not to. We vowed never to keep anything from each other. That's the trouble. I've held back from telling you for some time now. I didn't want to hurt you. - You, hurt me? Here it is, then. It happened gradually, without my realizing it. I couldn't laugh. I couldn't sleep. I wondered if it was your fault, but no. You're as wonderful as ever. You stay the same. I'm the one who has changed. I ask myself over and over: Why am I no longer impatient? Why is waiting no longer a torment? Why does my heart not leap up when he arrives? The sound of the elevator's approach no longer thrills me. Héléne! It's a horrible discovery, but I wish to be frank. My heart is drifting away from you. I'm ready for your reproaches, bitterness and insults. I've called myself the worst names already. Only one insult could wound me now: ''hypocrite.'' Héléne, you're wonderful. You were the first to speak, but I was guilty first. The story of your love is exactly the story of my own. All you thought, I thought as well. I kept silent, suffering. What a lesson you've taught me! - Really? - Really. Héléne, you're beautiful. You're stunning. It's like I'm seeing you for the first time. We should congratulate ourselves. It would have been awful if one went on loving longer than the other. Yes, awful. What now? - Neither of us has betrayed the other. We can avoid a messy breakup. We'll continue to see each other. We'll elude the death throes of a languishing love. No deceit, no surprises, no disgust. We'll be unique among our kind. I give you back your freedom, and you give me mine. We each go our own way. We'll be each other's confidant, though I doubt I'll find anyone to confide in you about. You've set such a high standard. Can anyone ever know the future? I may soon find you were the only woman capable of making me happy. Perhaps you'll feel the same. And one day we'll meet again, and I'll be at your side until we die. What if you don't find me when you return? Anything's possible. I might fall for another. He couldn't compare to you, but still - That would be nobody's fault. Good night, Héléne. Good night,Jean. Take all the calls. I'm not home for anybody. Anybody? Anybody. I'll have my revenge. Agnés, darling, you look awful. Thanks. Always such cheerful news. I say what I think. Hurry up. For those morons? Morons who wait for you and send such lovely flowers. Leave them alone. You're so tense. We must take them home. I hate potted flowers. Especially when a drunkard sends them! - You're mad! - No, I'm not. You're very ill-tempered this evening. Sorry, Mama. I'm not angry,just tired. Follow that car. Yes, ma'am, it's me. Héléne! What are you doing here? Come with me. You deserve a good scolding. Not a word from you in three years. I thought we no longer existed for you. I might say the same of you. It's Agnés' fame that led me to you. Otherwise I'd never have found you. - You know about our troubles? - I suspected. Financial ruin upon arriving in Paris. This enormous apartment, and me clinging like a fool to my dwindling furniture. My dressers, consoles, cupboards, chandeliers - everything I'd brought from the country. May God keep you from poverty, Héléne. And Agnés? An angel! She's resigned to it. Her life was dancing, but this was not her dream. She wanted to live for dancing, not dance to earn us a living. In the blink of an eye she gave up on all her true talents - the opera, fame. She's a success. <i>Leave me alone!</i> Enough! This is my home! Agnés! My little girl! <i>I'm no little girl. I'm a whore.</i> <i>Leave me in peace.!</i> My God, my God! I'm so distraught. I heard nothing. I see and hear only what I wish to. And I was so happy to see you again! Come on. What a disaster! It's over. All over. What are you saying? Nothing is over. I'm here. No one can help us anymore. - I'm just in time then. Let me handle it. - It's hopeless. It's not hopeless. It's very simple. Please, calm down. I can't go on. You're going to have a decent life. I'll see to that. Why would you care about women like us? That girl cannot remain in this mess. I must intervene. First, you must leave this mess behind and find a less dangerous way of life. But we can't. Agnés must stop showing herself off in public. You'll sell the rest of your furniture, flee this house and its intruders, and I'll see to your new home. - I have debts. - I'll take care of them. - You won't see anyone at first. - People will find us. If you don't want them to, they won't. Use your real name again. Take up your old lifestyle. Erase three years from your history. It won't be hard. Please, not a word of thanks! Just follow my advice. - You're an angel. - We are all angels. Obey me and don't worry. You'll leave here tomorrow. Now calm down and get some rest. Don't bother seeing me out. Agnés! - What a gloomy place! - A piano! I'm not supposed to dance, but we have music. No one's stopping you. Dance! Are you sure all this is necessary? If so, I accept it, but do you realize what we're in for? I do. Our life was a nightmare. And this is a dream? Look. I call this a prison. Trees! You have a lovely view of the square. Am I allowed to look outside? Now don't forget our agreement: You mustn't thank me. The Bois de Boulogne at 3:00 this afternoon. Don't wander far from the waterfall, and be on time. Agnés must be bored staying in all the time. She'll be glad to get out. At the waterfall. Precisely. I'm going out, but I'll be back for lunch. There'll be two of us. So, you're shutting yourself in? You have a secret. Tell me. We said we would tell each other everything. - People bore me. - Even Jacques? I don't want to see him. - You still love me. - Perhaps. And you behave like a saint. Perhaps. Now I believe you're capable of any heroism. I can be heroic if I must. But why do you live so alone? So removed from everything? You are made to be loved and admired. Use your charms - not just your feminine charms, but that magical charm of yours. It's no use, dearJean. My heart is at peace. I never thought our friendship would make me so happy. Please don't let our separation condemn you to a life of solitude. - So, you recommend Jacques? - I do. - Is that your advice as a friend? - As a friend. You're mine for the afternoon. I'm taking you out for a stroll. And I'm taking you to a show. On such a sunny day? I'd hate to be cooped up in the dark. We'll go for a stroll, then. Where? Anywhere. The Bois de Boulogne? Faces from the past. They were my neighbors in the country three years ago. I'd like you to meet one of my dearest friends. - What do you think of her? - I hardly looked at her. - You looked at her quite a bit. - She has a striking face. She looks more like a country lass than a Parisian girl. It's her gaze that I like. She looks you straight in the eye, yet in a shy way. You know, I was tempted to leave you and drive them home. Phone. Hello? We just got in. What? Happy? You're happy? So are we, my dear. See you soon. - Héléne is happy. - About what? Not long ago, tea time would have sent you running. Only to avoid your babbling lady friends. But there are other women. - Others? Have you seen the ladies from the Bois again? Why, no. What a shame! You should see them again, invite them over, help them. You like my ladies from the Bois? They're unlike the ladies you usually associate with. Very perceptive of you. They're so unlike them that they refuse to come when I invite them. - Why? - Out of tact and scruples. Are they so poor? They went very quickly from wealth to destitution and found simple contentment. They surprise me. - I admire them. Do you think I could see them, entertain them? Certainly not. You have no idea what that girl is like. No idea at all. She is beyond anyone's reach. You can't touch her nor tempt her. You'd get nowhere. If I were to go, would they throw me out? You? Go to Port-Royal Square? Port-Royal Square? Of course they would. I should just give up the whole idea? That would be wise. My dearJean, be careful with your whims. You're flirting with disaster. I'd rather warn you than console you. See you tomorrow? See you tomorrow. The gentleman forgot his gloves. I'll return them to him tomorrow. He won't be back tomorrow. I'm in luck. I'm not. Leave me alone! The waterfall at the Bois de Boulogne - have you forgotten? Was that you at the waterfall? I had forgotten. I'm so happy. I was certain I'd find you. Certain? Since we met, I've felt attached to you by a string. I simply followed it. - Is that string called indiscretion? - No. Certainty. - I must go. - So soon? Do you like rain that much? Is it raining? - The rain goes on and on. - Yes, on and on. - Where are you going? - To get an umbrella. - For whom? - You. Don't bother! I hoped I could say hello to your mother. What a pity! She's out. Take her umbrella. - Her umbrella? - Take it. - You're not going down again! - I insist. I won't damage it. I'll bring it back. Don't bother. Keep it. It's old and has soaked up many a storm. A souvenir? Give it to our mutual friend from the Bois. Will you see her soon? - I rarely see her. And you? Once a year. We don't see anybody. And I'll thank you to remember that. Follow your string now, and don't lose your way. - Why the long face? - You wouldn't understand. Understand what? You lend an umbrella - It's not the umbrella! I didn't break all ties with our former life because it was a jumble of poverty and empty luxuries. I broke ties with it because I needed to live and enjoy living. Those flowers ruin everything. But they bring joy, my angel. There was a time when I would see a man's face behind every bouquet. Now look. Behind these flowers, there's still a man's face threatening us. That's what we've come to. - You're always so dramatic. Yesterday our door would open to any man and - flowers! Today, it closes in their face and - flowers! Tomorrow there'll be more. - We'll refuse. Yet I'm still the same girl. You shouldn't have lent him that umbrella. I didn't <i>lend</i> it to him. I forbade him to return it. But it was my umbrella! I'm sorry, Mama. But believe me, I had to. - That's all right. Forget about it. - If only I could. - And be simple. - Simple? Yes, simple, like me. I take things as they come. I ask of things only what they wish to give. These flowers give me their perfume, and I breathe it in. Going out? Where? - To recover our peace of mind. - You're crazy! - I want what's happening to be clear. Agnés, what is it? - We've been found out. - What a mess. Tell me about it. Can't you guess? - Someone I know? -Yes. Then I can guess. He was waiting for me in front of our place. I was on my way home. He escorted me to my door. We're at the flower stage now and expecting his visit soon. You shouldn't have received him the first time. I sent him away. It was raining. Was I right to do so? - I approve. - Sincerely? Sincerely. - He'll come back. What should I do? - Show him the door. Take my advice. You understand how difficult it was for my mother and me to turn away a friend of yours without consulting you. I understand. But I will help you. - Help me? - In any way I can. - I'm such a fool. - Why? - I was afraid. - Afraid of what? Afraid, that's all. I was ill at ease. I imagined you giving out our address to anyone. In my mind you were indifferent to our problems, preoccupied solely with your own existence. I was so foolish. Do you feel better now? You trust me? - Yes, I do. - Good. Now sit down. You're going to write a letter. - To whom? - To me. To you? It'll be easy. We'll write it together. Where have you been? No one's seen you for days. I've just had a fascinating experience. I walked along the Seine, and I tried to count up to a thousand between bridges. If I went beyond a thousand, I turned around and counted more slowly. Climbing the stairs I told myself, ''If I reach the landing on my left foot, I'm lost.'' Luckily, I landed on the right. And what drives you to these kinds of activities? Despair. Despair? I must speak even if I hurt you. I'm ill. I can't be without her. I managed to see her again. - Whom? - The girl from the Bois. I found their haven, thanks to you. - Me? Did I give you the address? - Not you. Your mouth. Sometimes our mind lets words slip from our tongue unheeded. In other words, you made a blunder. - If I did, I apologize. - You must do me a favor. - What? The ladies from the Square turn me away. They never go out, and they receive no one. Héléne, that girl is wonderful. I must see her again. You must give me this one chance. I'll think about it on one condition: You must quit harassing them with your advances. You're causing me trouble. They complained to me in writing. If you need proof. here is the letter. It's from Agnés. Read it. Her writing is so like her. Without pretense. Childlike and noble. This is like Cinderella's slipper. If I found a letter like this in the street, I'd do everything in my power to find the girl who wrote it. That's your only reaction? I'll leave them alone, I promise. But you must give me your word you'll let me see them again. What are you dragging me into? Why put me in such an impossible position? How is it my business whether you love her or you don't? Work out the affairs of your heart on your own. Can you imagine the consequences of my kindness if those kind women knew I was helping carry out your whims? Héléne, you don't understand. This is no mere whim. I love you too much to involve you in a meaningless love affair. No, Héléne. I love her. I'm losing my head. I'm capable of anything. Agnés' face is like a gash across my heart. I meet her in my dreams and dream of her in my waking hours. I walk the streets thinking of ways to break down her door, to storm the barriers she's erected, to scream out the pain I feel. And when I've tired myself out, I turn to counting. Trees, cracks in the sidewalk, lampposts. I'm going mad. How you must love her! So recently cured of love, and now you'll do anything to go mad again? - When will I see her again? - And you're proud of it! - When will I see her again? - I don't know. I wish you'd stop playing that piano! I thought my music would soothe your pain. You won't let me see her? You're crazy, my dear. There's no cure for you. There is, but you won't give it to me. It isn't that I won't. I can't. Jean! Let me leave. - Why are you leaving? - I don't like the piano. - What are you going to do? - Disappear. Disappear where? Never see her or you or anyone ever again. This is all so absurd. You'll come by one evening. I'll arrange for you to see her here. - Could it really be? - I'm as crazy as you are. You still have a terrible hold over me. and it frightens me. - You can make them see me? - No. But I can give chance a hand. - Give me some time. - No, it must be soon. Tomorrow! You're another person when you dance. You light up like a chandelier. I'm about to put out that chandelier. I'm giving up dancing. What now? I've decided to quit dancing and dressing up. I need to put it all behind me. Agnés, my little girl. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing? I thought you were dead. - Nothing at all. I'll never dance again. It was my heart. Telephone. - The telephone. - I'll go. No, I will. Be reasonable and go lie down. This evening? Yes, of course, my dear. Certainly, with pleasure. We're invited to Héléne's. Agnés is here. Speak to her. I'd be delighted. See you tonight. - Will it be just us? - Of course. It's a joy for us to be here. We live like savages at our place. - Are you blaming me? - Not at all. Mother only meant it's delightful of you to have us over alone. You know very well I wouldn't dream of introducing you to anyone. I promised. Good evening, Héléne. I just dropped in for dinner, but I see I'm interrupting. Yes, you are. But since you're here, you might as well stay. You know everyone. Have a seat. We forgive you. Call first next time. You mustn't just show up on a whim. It must be lovely to live by your whims, to have a string that always leads you to the right place. Very lovely. My daughter and I take this opportunity to thank you for your flowers. The house is full of them. It looks like a greenhouse. Like a dream! Agnés was delighted. She was - I think broken glasses - You said it at the same time. Make a wish. Yes, let's. I've made mine. And I mine. Wouldn't it be funny if we made the same wish? Find a woman who would do as much for you as I have. What a disaster! I mean dinner. The awkwardness, the restraint, the uneasiness. Their hasty escape. It was adorable. - Still crazy? - More than ever. I have to have that girl! And perhaps you will. But how? We'll see. I know her, my dearJean. It's quite clear. Agnés, will you kindly explain your behavior? That man is charming. So unlike the others we've met. You must admit he's something else. Why the long face and the broken glasses? Why leave in such a hurry? Why embarrass Héléne like that? It was quite uncalled for. Good night, dear. Are you crying? Leave me alone. I never want to see Héléne or him again. You were busy eating and drinking, but I saw through it all. All what? Tell me. It's impossible to explain. I prefer not to understand. It'd be worse if I did. Promise never to see Héléne or accept anything from her again. I'm afraid that's impossible, darling. She plays with men, and she's playing with us. Men are fools. Too bad for him! Promise me. - Without her we'd be out on the street. - I know it, and so does she. It's tragic. Destiny is tragic, but I prefer a fate we choose to one forced upon us. What's sad is I can't do anything anymore. - I had a career once. - Don't torment yourself. You have so many ways of making yourself and others happy. Make whom happy? I'm thinking of you, my angel. Now go to sleep. Don't give it any more thought. I'll fight this battle alone. Oh, it's you. I knew it. I had to come. I'm sorry, but I can't ask you in. Come in. My daughter will be back soon. She mustn't find you here. - Can't I see her? - No, she mustn't even suspect you came by. Our place is very small. So this is where she lives and sleeps. She plays piano here, and she sits and reads over there. The lamp is her. These flowers are her. This cushion, this frame - it's all her. Yes, it is. I see I'll have to show you everything. - Her room. - Agnés' room. Her books. Her pictures. Agnés at age five. and ten. On horseback at 1 6. What's that? A costume. - She likes to dress up? - She used to. She liked dresses, hats, and jewels, but she does without them now. With your permission, I'd love to give her a present from time to time without her knowing. She'd never accept. She wouldn't have to know where they came from. You'd give them to her. We'll see. She detects the slightest lie. Now please go. - May I at least leave this letter for her? No, no letters. Go quickly! Mama, we are saved! - From what? - From Héléne and everybody. I found a job. What's the matter? - Nothing. A real job! It's a surprise. Let's go tell Héléne. I can't wait. Mama, something's wrong. - It's nothing, I tell you. Somebody looked through my things. I was tidying up. Your costume fell down. And what's this? ''Even if you never come, I will wait for you every day at the waterfall.'' Agnés, tell me about your job. What kind of work is it exactly? Are you sure no one will recognize you if you work in public? Don't be rash, Agnés. I'm not being rash, Mama. Shall I lock you in? Please,just give me a second. Do those men frighten you? Isn't there another exit? No, and they're not leaving. I know. They've been watching for you since this morning. The price of fame. - What fame? They want autographs. Come on, everyone knows you. The whole store is talking about it. They know you're a dancer. What's wrong? It's hopeless. There's no way out of this. Explain it to me, Mama. I don't understand. Is there nothing more to life than carrying the burden of one's past mistakes? It's not fair. - Someone recognized you. I told you. Always ''I told you''! There's no hope. I give up. But we can't go back to that horrible life that you hated. - Men are vicious! - Not all of them. Whom are you referring to? You're so impatient! Like a bull at a gate. You decide this, decide that. You rush into things. Just let things be. Look. - What's this? - Put them on. Where did they come from? Put them on and look at yourself in the mirror. You think it's not having fine things that makes me unhappy. See how beautiful you are. It's not the lack of fine things that makes me unhappy. If they were real pearls, I'd throw them out the window. Hello, Agnés. What lovely pearl earrings! I recognize them from my jeweler's shop. I noticed he had sold them recently. I knew I'd find you wearing them. - You've got it wrong. Should someone your age be wearing such expensive jewelry? Take them off right now. You're hopeless. How could you? - You've got it wrong. You're behaving like a tramp. A horrible little tramp! Send these pearls back where they came from with a curt note. How can Agnés behave so foolishly and inappropriately? You must keep an eye on her, my dear. Stop her from doing these things. Don't destroy everything I've built. Don't tear apart what's taken such effort to put together. How can you allow your daughter to be treated like a tramp? That's what you do when you allow her to accept gifts like that. But I suppose it's my fault. I ask you to live like hermits, and I'm sure it must be very dreary. If this life seems a bit oppressive, why don't you tell me? I can lighten the load. You must recognize I've helped you and that we've almost achieved our goal. Yes. Then help me to help you. And warn me when that little fool does anything stupid. You promise? - Yes, Héléne. I think you're right. I promise. ''I'm not the courageous type. I'm writing to tell you what I'd never dare say in person. And yet -'' Where are you going? Where are you going? Answer me! I'm sure she's up to something foolish. She hasn't been the same since yesterday. I told you to watch her. You asked for it. - Asked for what? The worst. for you. - Where is she? - If I knew, we'd try to save her. No doubt she's outdoing herself this time. She'll end up ruining everything. I've waited every day, but I never thought you'd come. I didn't come to meet you but to give you this letter. - A letter? Is it bad news? - Very bad. Then I don't want it. Please read it. I insist. - I'll tear it up. - No! We're unlucky. Every time we meet alone, it's raining. Come. Let's get out of the rain. So, you live in this cave? How odd. I've only a moment to tell you so much. Let's make this moment last forever. We can do it. We can make it last an entire lifetime, Agnés. Let's go far away. You're not saying no? I don't frighten you? Tell me this isn't some absurd dream. Tell me you're putting up barriers between us that don't really exist. That everything is clear and simple, and nothing separates us. Read this letter. We'll read it together one day, in the sun. There's a train at 7:00 waiting to take us away. We just have time. Take a cab and meet me at the station. Gare de Lyon at 7:00! Where are you going? Where have you been? Did you tell him everything? I told him nothing. You love him! My dear friend, you are very foolish. I told you your idea was doomed. These women are impeccable. Yes, I am foolish. You were right. Now you spend your whole life waiting - on stairways, in caves, at train stations. What about your work? - I can't work. I can't talk to anyone anymore. I can't read or write or live anymore. I haven't a shred of will left. I'm a walking ghost. I wish I could just sleep. Sometimes I feel like driving in my car until I fall asleep and crash. I wouldn't advise traveling. You'd drive 20 miles and turn back. My dear, we've come - Actually, Agnés didn't want to come, but I'm sure that in your kindness you'll understand me. It's a very serious and delicate matter that has me quite upset. I hesitate to mention it as you've always been very good to us. It's only our long-standing friendship that allows me to speak. Excuse me. Hello? Speaking. Go, then, my dear friend. What? I'm not helping you? That's all I'm doing, helping you. It's true. What do you expect me to do? Then go! I don't understand a word you're saying. You've shown how fond you are of us, and I'm sure we can come to understand each other. I don't know if we are of use to you in any way- Not in the slightest! Agnés is going through a difficult time. I'd like us to help her. We feel obligated to have your consent before we do anything. Consent? We are in debt to you, and it weighs heavily on Agnés. I'd like to hear you say she's free. Free? I set you both totally free. But you're hardly free, since you're practically married. Married? You're such an odd one, my dear Agnés. You drive a man mad - what do you expect me to do? You must choose: Marry him or tell him everything. Or shall I tell him? Mama, let's go. Marriage is out of the question. - I won't do it. - Why? If I accepted this horrible solution, where would it lead? He would find out everything. No one would think twice about telling him. People aren't criminals, Agnés. Be a woman. Fight! Don't spoil your life forever. You'll tell him afterward. Things will change then. In any case, you no longer have a choice. Let's go. How many miles? Sixty, round trip. - Well? - My mind is made up for good. God knows you and I are not the marrying kind. Oh, leave me out of this. Could you see yourself getting married? Yes, and today I can tell you that. But there's only one man I would marry. Who? You. You disapprove of my marriage? She's perfect for you. You're very lucky. I'm so glad to hear you say that. And after all I've asked of you, I'd like to ask for one final favor that should be no trouble at all. I put my fate in your hands. Tell them of my intentions. I don't think they'll need much convincing. Not so fast, my dearJean. This isn't about them. It's about you. I must know more about this. I don't want you rushing into some new adventure. - You said they were impeccable. - Of course they are. If things work out, I'm at their disposal. They seem to prefer to avoid people. If they like, we can have a simple wedding. On the contrary. I envision a huge wedding. Let me organize it. I'll take care of everything. But I repeat: Slow down. No, make it as quickly as possible. I could never do enough for your happiness. I'm afraid I was completely wrong about that girl. I'm afraid for you. Look at people's expressions. Ask some questions. About what? And whom should I ask? Agnés. Where's Agnés? I don't know. Come along. Come! I can't face them or anyone anymore. Come along. Kill me, but don't drag me out there. Let go. Do what you like with me. I deserve it. But I beg of you - - Let go! Héléne has told you everything, and now that you know - I know nothing and wish to know nothing! You hear me? Madame has fainted. Look after her. Héléne! You look upset. What's wrong? What is this horrible mystery I'm involved in? I don't understand a thing. Please tell me. Don't be afraid of hurting me. I'm going crazy! It's quite simple. You've married a tramp. She was a cabaret dancer. You played a trick on me, and now I've played one on you. You? Yes, me. You don't seem to realize where a woman's scorn can lead. You? Don't be absurd. You've married a tramp. Now you must face the consequences. You're suddenly so sentimental. You're horrid! Since your marriage seems to mean so much to you, you mustn't run off. Return to Agnés' side. You won't be the only one to console her. All her lovers are inside. And there are plenty of them! She's very ill. She's fainted three times. Her heart may fail any minute. I'm very worried. We must do something. Please, madame, let me by. You're here. In time perhaps you'll forgive me. But don't hurry. So many honest girls become dishonest women. Perhaps I'll show the opposite can happen. I'm not yet worthy to have you come close to me. Wait. Just leave me a little hope. Then you can judge my behavior. I'll be happy if you can bear my presence. Show me a corner of your house where I can live. I'll stay there without protest. I'm not evil. I know myself. I was weak. And I was in love with you - that's my only excuse. I lacked the courage to tell you the truth. Remember the letter you wouldn't read? It wasn't pleasant. You can forget me. I won't trouble you anymore. It will be easy. Hold on to life with all your strength. Hold on to me! I love you. You can't leave me! Try to hold on! Fight! I am fighting. You're my wife. I love you. Stay with me! I'll try. That's an order. You can't disobey! Stay with me! I will stay. THE END Stay As You Are Excuse me! Do you know where the gardener is? Do you know where is the gardener? The gardener? Thanks. Good afternoon! My name is Marengo. I am a landscape gardener from Rome. I'd like to you about a awkward matter. I know this park very well, and I remember there's been - don't know where - statue of Diana Yes, yes, it's standing over there. - O yes, over there! Matter is, I've got the task of newly designing the park of Conte Arqui, here in Florence. He. too, know this Diane very well, he is straight in love with it. In one word, he wants to buy it. Nothing will be sold here, not even a dry leave. Hello Osvaldo! - Hello darling! The last bus has just gone, I fear you won't make it home anymore. O, I'll make that easily. May I ask where you want to go? To Florence. If you'll be patient for a moment I'll bring you. I'm not patient! Will you take me to Florence? A bit far to walk? Yes. How did you know it's me? Yes, that's been hard to guess. Come on, get in. I come out here to learn, but if I manage to get through half a page, that would be a lot. Say, what do you think about cypresses dying? Well, they're just dying. I don't believe you. I've seen you have botany books. Tuscany is in danger to lose her charme. I prefer a less pitturesc scenery. A clear scenery, radiating calmness, not demanding anything. I, for instance, have never been in the Ufficies so far, and I feel quite well with that. Now I know how to answer a friend's question Are we still at the museum, or have we moved on to the next chapter? The next chapter. Yeah, great! And what's your friend's question? She asked me, what excites me most at a man. And what? So far, I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 things. But now I know. The hands. The hands? Hand speak a language of their own. They tell you what's going on inside. Yes, really! While you were talking about cypresses you were only longing to touch me. No, no, I'm not aware of that. Then it was them that wanted to. They wished to touch me. Well, maybe. Just a moment! I have to ask these men something. So what? You afraid of me that much? I'll be right back. No, wait! Pet me once! Listen please, excuse me! - There you are! These are the exact instructions. - Thanks! Good luck! Hello! Yes, what I wanted to say. The matter with the hands.. I believe you were right. They wanted to touch you. Why did you run away? I'll explain you when we'll meet. Oh excuse me, I didn't know. - Doesn't matter. I'll go to bed anyway. You'll see me naked soon. Oh, really. We both live here. - Oh, I see. She's aked me to come back late, but I had enough of walking outside. Besides it's been too cold. You're some folks, you two! You're some crazy folks! When I need the bed, she sleeps in the first class waiting room at the station. I'm afraid of those inhibited guys. You know, those who buy porno mags and then touch themselves all the time. Could you explain me why all these are pictures of old men? These are hers. She looks at them, studies them. And what's your name? Hers or mine? Both! Francesca. Cecilia. Listen, Cecilia, do me a favour! Tell her I'll come back tomorrow around noon. Yes, with pleasure. Ciao! But what's your name? Giulio. - Till tomorrow then! Ciao! - Ciao! And so I quit lecturing at the Institute for Restauration. I'm still working for a couple of magazines, but less and less. Have become really lazy. But you've always been like that! Though there'd been plenty of work since the flood. They are afraid of theft. They take the picture to a bank or the basement. And there they're moulding. And then they take them to us for restauration. And you? You know,i .. despite of these terrible devastations I'm still dealing with tree, with flowers, with gardens. A privilege. Sure! In such a bad world like nowaydays. Thanks! - Coffee? - Yes. Two cups of coffee! Are you married? But you've sent me a wedding present! - Impossible! A picture! A watercolour! The ducks! So that's where my ducks ended up! If you knew how I've been looking for them! But you had them! May I buy them back? - No. Do you care that much? No, but my wife does. We haven't met for an eternity! But why? Are you listening at all? Of course! No chance with the geese! Ciao Lorenzo! - Ciao Francesca! - Ciao! Francesca is calling again! - That's her newest one! Do you know her for long? No. Since yesterday, to be exact. I've been at Garzoni mansion to find a statue for a garden Do you know who she is? Fosca's daughter! What Fosca? - What Fosca! Your great love! Turn back time, about 20 years! You don't remember Fosca? Ah, that Fosca! The Fosca from then! We often went out all the four of us. You with the chubby one, what's been her name? Teresa. If you'd see her today - a catastrophy! An evil old hag, neurotic and gossiping like no other. If you consider how beautiful she's been in her youth! And in bed! I could tell you.. What became of Fosca? You don't know? Dead, for 5 or 6 years. But we haven't seen you for an eternity either. Wow! She's almost more beautiful than Fosca. But .. she's not looking similar to you at all. Better not! No, why should she look similar to me? What do you want to say? I haven't started that rumour. But Teresa keeps saying that. Saying what? Please, stop that joking! You can't possibly mean . One can't just tell such stories! Calm down! Teresa is a gossip, that's well known. What she's saying about me, you can't imagine. Unbelievable! About you? Well, please, I don't care about that! But Giulio, listen! - But about me! - Just been kidding! Besides, I remember as if it were yesterday. Right afterwards, a month later she's been sleeping with that guy from Trieste. An engineer or the like. Working abroad. She went with him to Africa or anywhere else in the third world. There Francesca has been born. He's been building bridges and roads. After a few years Fosca reappeared in Florence. She had left him. But she brought the child with her, that Francesca. That's all. You see! And how can a woman spread such unbelievable rumours, that.. Teresa. Do not pay attention, these are Teresa's kind of jokes. Besides, how would you tell today whether you've been the father, or he? And why? No! No, no! Is it that important? She isn't my child! Francesca was born on 10th July of the next year. That makes it clear, my calculation is right! Cause life is a boomerang, my dear sweet Giulio! You're doing your mess - and, zack!, they're comming back upon you! Like with Lorenzo! Have you seen him? Have you talked to him? You can't fool me! That's useless! Since he's left, eh, since I've left him, he's become a badass. Still upset about him? Half a life has gone by! But he's still a pig! A dirty pig! Back to Fosca, you've spread entirely unfounded rumours! I remember having met Fosca once, before she went away with the other one. She's been pregnant in the 6th or 7th month then. I've asked her if the child was yours. But why? She's been living with the Trieste guy longtime! Who's been building these collapsing bridges. I've always been sure that you were the one who made her pregnant! Because you are the same kind of badass like your friend Lorenzo! Once in the countryside you've actually raped me! We were drunk, how stupid! - Drunk? What did Fosa say, yes or no? She said neither no, nor yes. She smiled. Impishly. Very beautiful! - Thanks! But as my son fell in love with that statue. I know. I've really done what I could, but it's won't happen. I've already told your son, such a statue is not for sale. Such a shame! How graceful! Your daughter? - No. No, no! That's from the host, sweet wine and cockies. Excellent! - No, thanks I had enough already. Try at least, else you'd offend the host. Giulio, eat another mandarine! Vitamins are healthy! No, I'm almost bursting! Francesca, stop that! So, I'm leaving! Hold on a minute, I'll take you home afterwards. Here, a last one! We are sitting here for an hour, and you never open your mouth! Except to stuff the salami inside. And bean salad. Even my steak you've eaten! So what? I know how you are! All you need is a sandwich, a motorbike and a juke box. You haven't any eating culture! Anyway, she's got to leave now. But if . sorry, I have to. I won't come home, I'll sleep at Tino's. A kind girl, your friend! At me you never look! Or you're fixing me with your eyes like a cop. Why did you insist on Cecilia staying with us for the evening? It's only natural, she's your friend! But I think you're doing that not to be alone with me! But why? I'm quite happy with you. Last night was . wonderful, incredibly nice. Then I started to think. Are you aware how much older I am than you? And then I've got a wife. A daughter. Obstacles over obstacles! But you mustn't marry me! You make fun about everything. In your age that's still o.k. In mine less. Once I had a friend who was even older than you. Not as kind as you. Far not! Don't you want to come in? I have to get back to Rome Now, at such a late hour? So that means goodbye? Yes. And no. I use to come here to Florence for my work. Then we might meet, once in a while. Or better.. No, better not. Let's leave it at that. But we'll stay friends? I'd love to, if you want to. What to do in such a case? Shake hands? I know, I know, you're right. It's stupid. In my age one always talks about age with a child like you. But there are other reasons, like . You haven't heartburn after a meal, too, have you? One day you'll know what I mean. Quite trivial reasons, sorry. Goodbye, Mr. Fool Ah, I am scared jump Is your husband Points in a low voice Who are you? Is my friend and his wife, who is a photographer You live here?

True.</i> <i>I don't even need all that. I just want a good brother.</i> <i>That's right.</i> <i>He doesn't have to make a lot of money, so long as he's got a job.</i> Hallelujah. Yes, yes. He just has to be taller than me, college educated, and not crazy. No kids, good teeth, and no kinky sex. <i>I mean, I like to switch it up a bit, but, you know.</i> What? <i>You're doing it again. The list, Kenya. The list.</i> You know what? You should have stayed with Rashid Mohammed. How can you do the Muslim chauvinist thing? Whatever, girl. Rashid was fine. Okay? I would have been a bean-pie eating, mosque-going. walking five steps behind his behind, wearing a burka. <i>Listen, I've been listening to this new CD by Dr. LaWanda Phillips.</i> Now, she says that if we keep hanging onto this preconceived notion. of what we think we want. <i>we're actually cutting ourselves off from our universal abundance.</i> See, we hold on so tight. to this image that we have of our IBM. <i>"Ideal Black Man. "</i> <i>But she says that we've got to let go.</i> in order to let love flow. <i>In fact that's what it is called. "Let go, let flow. "</i> That means you, Kenya. No more lists. <i>"Let go, let flow. " That's right.</i> <i>Yes, and it's a whole lot better than, "Keep hope alive. "</i> <i>Okay, y'all.</i> Let go, let flow. This universe is listening. Perfect, my loves. Yes. So, as long as he is black and fine. <i>And educated, well-spoken, with a job.</i> <i>With a well-paying job.</i> <i>You have one new message.</i> <i>Kenya, it's Rashid. Happy Valentine's day.</i> <i>You've been on my mind a lot.</i> <i>I wanted you to know that I'm getting married.</i> <i>Yeah, she is wonderful.</i> <i>I met her at a Farrakhan rally.</i> <i>Kenya, I just really want you to come to the wedding.</i> Hello. <i>Happy Valentine's day, sweet pea.</i> You never forget, do you? <i>Forget my baby girl? Impossible.</i> Thanks, Dad. <i>You sound down. Talk to me.</i> <i>No, I'm fine. Everything's great.</i> <i>Sweet pea. Don't give up, baby girl.</i> <i>You know how to make your dreams come true.</i> Miss McQueen? <i>Dr. Brockton, I didn't see you.</i> Looking all cute. Thanks. Brothers, this is Kenya McQueen. <i>So, how's Laurie? She's fine.</i> <i>Why don't you sit down and join us? I can't.</i> Meeting someone? Oh, no. Because a friend of mine went on one of those Internet blind date things recently. <i>Watch out. There's some real stalkers out there.</i> Right. Good to see you. See you. Nice to meet you, Kenya. Good to see you. <i>You wouldn't be waiting for someone by any chance.</i> Someone named Brian? Why? <i>I'm him. I'm Brian, actually.</i> Are you Kenya? <i>Brian. Brian Kelly? Yeah.</i> Blind date Brian Kelly? <i>I'm sorry. It's that bad, huh?</i> Obviously, you were expecting someone else. No. Leah described you perfectly. <i>She's funny.</i> <i>Well, she said nothing but great things about you, so.</i> Should we sit? Sure. <i>Let's see if we can find a table. Great.</i> How you doing, brother? Magic treating you okay? Never met him. <i>They're all taken, so. Here's one. Just here.</i> Girl, you are wearing those dreads. <i>All right.</i> Uncomfortable? No. Why would you say that? <i>Well, you're talking to strangers, making sure everyone knows you're down.</i> So, you ever been on a blind date before? My first. <i>Why'd you do it?</i> <i>I don't know. I.</i> <i>promised my girlfriends I'd be more open.</i> But not this open. What? Nothing. You know what? It was really great meeting you. but I kind of, need to get going. <i>I've got a crazy week coming up. So much work to do.</i> But really, it was really - Nice meeting me. Nice meeting you. Yeah, really. You, too. Really. No, really. Bye. Bye. What was Leah thinking? I mean, I guess she meant well, but come on. <i>Yeah. Let's go. We just got here.</i> You got something else to do? Yes. I could be at home pleasuring myself. Hello. Hi. Lovely party. Can you believe this place? The azaleas, the lavender. Look at that fountain. You know they flew that tile in from somewhere. <i>Whoever did the landscaping.</i> Champagne. Thank God. Thank you. Leah sure can throw an engagement party. <i>Something's cooking in the kitchen.</i> See, now, why do I always get the ones in the aprons or the uniforms. with the nametags on them? <i>Am I wearing a sign that says, "all need apply"?</i> <i>Who's ready for something hot and sweet?</i> <i>But then again, "Let go, let flow. " Huh?</i> <i>Excuse me. Cheryl, don't leave me out here.</i> Hello. How you doing? How are you? <i>I'm Walter. Pleasure to meet you.</i> <i>I'm Cheryl. Nice to meet you. Hello, Cheryl.</i> What are you cooking? My specialty. <i>I'm ready for something hot and sweet.</i> <i>You'd like to taste one?</i> Yes. No problem. I call it my wishing fountain. You like it? Mrs. Cahan. Congratulations. Thank you. And please, call me Winnie. <i>You're like practically part of the family.</i> Your house is amazing. And I love the landscaping. Thank you. Thank you. <i>I just bought my first house, and I can't wait to landscape.</i> Well, congratulations. Then you must meet our landscaper. <i>I don't think he'd do a job as small as mine.</i> Well, no, we just have to ask him. Brian, sweetie, could you come here? <i>You know what? That's okay, I'm not ready.</i> No. Brian, this is a very good friend - Kenya, yes. We met. Right. I thought you were an architect. Landscape architect. Well, Kenya just bought her first house and she wants to do some landscaping. So maybe you could go take a look at it for her, sweetie. <i>Or recommend someone if you're too busy.</i> <i>Well, I think Kenya is probably the one who's too busy.</i> <i>I'm sure she has time. She was just raving about your work.</i> Really? It is nice. Thank you. Brian, she needs you. <i>If you'll excuse me, I have to go remind my daughter she's still a Cahan.</i> You look beautiful. Thank you. <i>Listen, I just have a small backyard and I don't really have a budget, so.</i> Well, small is okay. Business is business. <i>No pressure, but if you're ever ready, call me.</i> Take care. What are you doing? <i>You'll have to leave him in the car. I don't do dogs.</i> <i>Well, neither do I. We're just good friends.</i> I guess I walked right into that one. <i>Hi, how are you? I'm good.</i> <i>So, you don't do dogs, huh?</i> <i>I mean, I can't have dog hair all over my house.</i> <i>I hope it's not an imposition. No, I got it. I got it.</i> <i>Hear that, Max? She doesn't do dogs. So you have to wait in the truck. Okay?</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> Skiddley-Max! Go on, Max! In the truck! <i>There's a good boy.</i> <i>He's a good boy.</i> <i>It's around the back. Got you.</i> Listen, thanks for coming out here. and not, you know, holding my rudeness against me. I appreciate you saying that. So, what do you think? <i>Well.</i> <i>One thing's certain.</i> You need me. <i>Now, I'm just gonna throw around some ideas.</i> <i>but I saw you checking out Mrs. Cahan's fountain.</i> so I figure the focal point has gotta be a fountain. Fountain? I love that. Good. <i>But, I can't.</i> The electricity, the cost- Oh, no, we can make it work. You gotta have a fountain. <i>You come home from a hard day's work. You lay back on your chaise.</i> You listen to the sounds of the water, have a glass of wine. Now, this, are you married to this? No. Not at all. <i>All right, the tub's gone. Path.</i> And I was thinking we could build some kind of a structure here. Drape it in bougainvillea or. wisteria. <i>I like that. It's pretty.</i> You should see this job that I just finished. It turned out great. I covered the patio and the walls with this richly-hued flagstone. I did some interesting things with the lighting and stereo. <i>I'd love to see it.</i> Well, what are you doing right now? I can take you by. Now? Yeah. <i>I can't. I've got way too much work to do. Do you have any pictures of it?</i> <i>Pictures wouldn't do it justice.</i> <i>Well, today is out. I'm swamped.</i> <i>It's just in Los Feliz.</i> I can take you straight there and bring you straight back. Promise. Gorgeous day. Hey, you mind if I make a quick stop at the community garden? A quick what? <i>We're right here. Just dropping something off.</i> <i>I'll be real quick.</i> You can come in if you want. Maria, look what I got for you. <i>Mijo! Hey!</i> <i>Nice seeing you, Mijo. You, too.</i> <i>How you been? Más o menos.</i> The business has been good though. I hear about Penelope. Yeah. <i>She's a bitch.</i> Did you see it coming? Yeah, I guess, you know. How? Well, Maria. Honestly? <i>Penelope is great. She is. She's just not great with me.</i> MARIA Are you okay? Yeah. She is cute. <i>There's a spider in my hair. What?</i> <i>There's a spider in my hair. Wait.</i> Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Wait, wait. <i>There's nothing there.</i> Just breathe. Just breathe. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe. <i>You must think I'm a freak.</i> <i>No. Not at all. You just don't do spiders.</i> Or dogs. <i>There's a whole list. You have no idea.</i> You know. I could draw up some kind of a proposal and submit it to you. <i>And then the ball's in your court.</i> If you have any questions or ideas, just give me a call, anytime. All right? <i>I. I have to think about it.</i> <i>I'm still getting my head around the mortgage.</i> No pressure. Okay. Thanks. Good night. Sleep tight. Okay. <i>Don't let the spiders bite.</i> Kenya? I brought you a little present for the Pino account. Excellent. My very own personal computer. Bill Lebree. <i>Welcome aboard. I'll put you right to work. I'm at your service.</i> <i>I'll have the engagement letters, the procedures.</i> and the request lists around 3:00. <i>And I'll need them back by Thursday, no later than 10:00, 10:30.</i> And in the meantime, you can look these over. and get a breakdown of the depreciation and amortization. Got it. No problem. <i>Anything else you need, I'm here.</i> Thank you. Now, Kenya- Edwin, I know how important this account is. <i>Don't worry. I'm not worried.</i> We have complete confidence in you. <i>That's why you're being considered for partner.</i> Fantastic. Contingent, of course, on the Pino account. <i>I'll do it.</i> Well, this is certainly good news. Just wait till the gray hairs come. and you have to schedule in time to see your spouse. I look forward to that. For Miss Kenya McQueen, via messenger. For me? Your birthday? No. <i>Who's it from?</i> My new landscaper. No! Go! No! Go! Max, Max! Get out of there! Get back in the truck. Get in the truck! Skiddley-Max! <i>Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. He must have. He must have snuck out of the truck.</i> <i>Well, please do everything you can to make sure that he doesn't.</i> Yeah. Okay. I spilled your latte. <i>Thanks for the latte. It's real sweet.</i> No foam, extra hot. I was making one for myself. <i>That's really nice.</i> <i>So when do you think you're gonna be done?</i> <i>Well, we've only been here two days. You sick of us already?</i> <i>No, I was.</i> <i>I was thinking that maybe when you're done.</i> I could have a party out here. A housewarming? Yeah. <i>Yeah, I think that's a great idea.</i> You need to relax. Does it show? <i>You know, it's Saturday, you're wearing a suit and.</i> <i>I've got to go in. I've got a lot on my plate.</i> <i>I just found out I'm up for partner.</i> <i>Partner, huh? Wow, that's quite an achievement. Congratulations.</i> <i>Well, it hasn't happened yet. It will.</i> Better get back. Hey, what are you doing here on a Saturday? I got a job to do. for a hardworking lady that deserves a party. Thank you. What? What? Hi. Hi. <i>What's up with Iron Johnny, over there?</i> Hi, there. Hi. My bad. Stacy, my sister Kenya. Kenya, Stacy. <i>It's such an honor. Really.</i> <i>Here's the money for Mom's birthday. Good.</i> I got the tool for this job. <i>You didn't tell me you were landscaping.</i> Am I required to tell you everything? Brian, this is my baby brother, Nelson. Nice to meet you, man. <i>What's happening?</i> Forgive him. He was born arrogant. <i>It's the help.</i> Nelson! What? <i>By the way, what's this I hear?</i> You skiing the slopes? Are you sneaking off to the OC? Are you sleeping with the enemy? It was a blind date. <i>I didn't know.</i> Why did I tell you that? <i>Blind date? Blind. That is wrong!</i> My sister should be going out on a blind date with a white boy in the- <i>No! 'Cause you are not that desperate! What is the matter with you?</i> <i>I just don't want everyone knowing my business.</i> This is so awesome! Your first, very own house. Thank you. <i>Can I use the little girls' room?</i> <i>Yeah. It's right through there.</i> I hope she has a magic coochie. <i>Don't even go there, Miss Blind Date.</i> As a matter of fact, you should get yourself a little something-something. <i>I'm gonna hook you up. With your friends? Please.</i> Kenya, you need to make yourself more available. What does that mean? Interested. Open. Spontaneous. You need to let your guard down every once in a while. I tried. It backfired. Baby, could you do me a favor? Could you give my sister some tips on how to catch a man? Sure. I can give you some pointers. You need to get a good nutritionist. <i>You'd be amazed what a little diet can do.</i> It changed my life. Thank you. Thank you. So, where did you guys meet, anyway? I was driving. and Nelson pulls up next to me in his brand new Jag. <i>And I was like, "Oh my God, an XJS! This is not happening!"</i> Shut up! No, you shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. So, when are you gonna let me test drive that thing, anyway? Never. Never, ever. I would never ever let you drive my whip. So, I want to use a mixture of California natives and different perennials. to try and create a Mediterranean feel. You good with that? <i>I don't know one from the other.</i> Well, a California native obviously grows best in this environment. <i>And perennials, well, they're just flowering plants, they bloom seasonally.</i> They shift the energy and the mood for the garden. Here, check this out. Mediterranean lavender, you gotta have it. It has healing qualities. Yeah. In ancient times, it was used to honor the gods. <i>How'd you get into this, anyway? It was my dad.</i> Everywhere we lived, he had a garden. <i>And every spring, he'd make me help him plant stuff.</i> At first I hated it. Then after a while I kind of got into it. I was the only 12-year-old on my block who knew how to take care of cymbidiums. So at 12 you found your calling? Oh, no. It was a winding road. After college, I worked in an ad agency as a copywriter. I did that for six long years. An ad man, huh? <i>Yeah. Suit, tie, the whole thing. I.</i> I hated it. Then one day I took a cymbidium into my cubicle at the agency. Before too long the plants just took over. I started spending more time caring for them than working. It just clicked. So, what do you think of this, for ground cover? Yeah, it looks good. Great. <i>There's my sweet pea!</i> Do you two always have to make a scene? Happy birthday, Mother. Thank you, sweetheart. <i>Here's Nelson! Hi, sweetie.</i> Good to see you, Son. Father. <i>I'm sorry.</i> Kiki, these are my folks. Doctor and Mrs. McQueen. KIKl: Nice to meet you. <i>And that's my sister Kenya. Kenya, this is Kiki.</i> Hi, nice to meet you. <i>Your dress, it's very unique.</i> You like it? I made it myself. <i>I didn't sew it. It just clips.</i> What happened to the one with the implants? Stacy? Kiki happened to Stacy. Hey guys, how was your little trip to La Quinta? Fine. Of course, for a three-day trip, your mother packed five bags. Now, come on. It was a spa weekend. I had to have choices. <i>And besides, one of the bags was your father's golf bag.</i> So, Kiki, what do you do? <i>I work at the copy shop right now. But this fall I'll be going to design school.</i> <i>Well, we're a family of academics, as I'm sure Nelson has told you.</i> Dr. McQueen here is the head of neurosurgery at Cedars Sinai. Enough, Joyce. My daughter, soon to be made partner at Bailey, Banks and Biddle. Benson, Baily and Becks, Mother. Right, Becks, yes. And we are so proud of our dear Nelson. who has just joined the legal department at 20th Century Fox. Legal Department? I thought you were a producer. Good Lord, no! He graduated top of his law school class. That Jag was a graduation present from Dr. McQueen. Your daddy bought you that Jag? Mommy, Kenya is dating white boys now. I had one blind date. and nothing came of it, except I hired him as my landscaper. <i>She's landscaping.</i> So, it was Iron Johnny, huh? See, I knew there was something about that dude. <i>Actually he's really nice, and we're having a really great time.</i> <i>Ma! You're having a great time landscaping?</i> Burning the midnight oil? <i>I'm just trying to keep up with you.</i> Wow, nice. <i>It's really coming along.</i> Max, get over here. Max. <i>It's okay.</i> <i>I'm starving.</i> Want some takeout? <i>What's with all the beige?</i> <i>You are gonna paint, right? You're gonna bring some color in?</i> <i>What's wrong with beige?</i> <i>Well, it's.</i> safe. and impersonal. It kind of feels a little like a hotel. <i>It doesn't reflect you.</i> My mother thinks bright colors are for children and whores. What do you think? <i>I don't know.</i> See, I think color brings in energy. It excites the senses. I mean, it can make you feel sad, it can make you feel happy. It can make you feel bold. No, bold is definitely not me. Are you sure? <i>I don't think you take the time to know who you are.</i> <i>You're always working.</i> Yeah. Well, some of us have to work extra hard just to stay in the game. <i>You wouldn't understand.</i> Try me. <i>You're so full of advice tonight, Mr. Know Everything.</i> <i>Maybe it's time I give you some. All right, fire away.</i> <i>Well, for one, you're a lousy businessman.</i> <i>You didn't ask for an upfront payment.</i> <i>And you've already put in too many hours to make this job cost-effective.</i> Did it ever occur to you that I was giving you special treatment? I may not be the financial wizard, like yourself. but I have been running a small business, successfully, for over six years. Of course, if you feel the urge to review my books. then please, do me the favor. <i>I'll allow that.</i> <i>Trust me, you couldn't afford me.</i> <i>So, I take it you don't do white guys.</i> I just happen to prefer black men. <i>It's not a prejudice, it is a preference.</i> <i>Sure. It's your preference to be prejudiced.</i> What about you? Women are women. Some are poison, some are sweet. Ever date a black girl? All kinds of girls. <i>So you're a player. No.</i> <i>I'm just.</i> Just a landscaper. I take hard earth and make things bloom. <i>Speaking of which, it's late.</i> You need a hand with this? No, thank you. <i>Well, thanks for dinner. You're welcome.</i> <i>And I guess I'll see you tomorrow.</i> Bye. I let the guys go early for the holiday. <i>So, I'm gonna head off, too. Okay.</i> <i>There's just one thing. You're coming with me.</i> Why? Do we have something else to buy for the yard? <i>No, we're going hiking.</i> Just a day trip, nothing major. <i>Are you asking me out on a date? I'm asking you to go hiking.</i> <i>Well, then the answer is double no. I don't even like hiking.</i> Heads or tails? Who in their right mind would go out in heat like this? I mean, what is the point? <i>Don't look down, look up. Look at the mountains.</i> <i>I'm looking for rattlesnakes.</i> <i>Don't worry about rattlesnakes. The mountain lions eat most of them.</i> Very funny. Uh-oh. Shit! My hair! <i>I'm gonna kill you! I swear, I didn't see it coming.</i> <i>Don't think this is going any further, because it's not.</i> Good night. <i>Why'd they name you Kenya?</i> I was born there. My father was into world healthcare for a few years. My mother wanted to name me Tiffany. <i>She hated East Africa. Couldn't wait to get back to the States.</i> How come? <i>I don't know. She's my mother.</i> <i>There weren't enough places to shop.</i> Also, I had really bad asthma when I was little. <i>She didn't trust the hospitals there.</i> Asthma? <i>So that's why you hate bugs.</i> spiders. and tall grass. and hiking. Yeah, I was pretty sheltered. Little Kenya stuck inside while the other kids play. Drawing her pictures. and muttering her equations. <i>You think I'm pathetic, don't you? No, I don't.</i> <i>I think you're adorable.</i> Just adorable. Can I ask you one more question? Can you take this off? What do you mean? <i>I mean, it's not a wig, right?</i> <i>But it's not your real hair either, is it?</i> <i>I can't believe you just asked me that. I'm sorry. I'm just curious.</i> It is a weave, if you must know. I thought you dated black girls. They had real hair. I have real hair, too. Underneath? Yes, underneath! <i>So, what? They just. They sew it in? Something like that.</i> You know what? I think you should leave. <i>This isn't gonna work. I don't know what I was thinking.</i> It was a really, really stupid mistake. Now please go. <i>What? 'Cause I asked about your hair? Because of everything.</i> And furthermore, effective today. I will no longer be needing your services as a landscaper. <i>Yeah, you're a piece of work, Kenya McQueen.</i> Get out! Sorry if I offended you. <i>I just. I was just wondering what you'd look like completely naked.</i> You did what? With who? <i>I know. But.</i> It was raining, and we were hiking. You were hiking? And we just got carried away. All right. Well, can he bone? Nedra! What? <i>Don't be so crass! Oh, please!</i> Well, can he? See. Well, yes. <i>Now you're talking, girl. He got a big - Yes.</i> <i>But it's over.</i> <i>It's over.</i> It was a one time thing. In fact, I fired him. Kenya, you did what? It was never gonna work. Well, of course not, fool! <i>You don't have to marry him! Marry him, honey.</i> All you are doing is just having- Some good old-fashioned sex. For once in your tired sappy life. You need to let it flow. Take it out. Just getting the rest of my stuff. I knew it. What? <i>You're gorgeous.</i> <i>Don't worry about the balance.</i> Wait. <i>Don't go.</i> <i>I know you're sensitive about color.</i> <i>So we'll just take it slow.</i> <i>No one has to know if you don't want them to.</i> <i>It'll just be our little secret.</i> <i>Don't move.</i> <i>Yes. You can't tell me that white people don't have a special thing for dogs.</i> Dog hotels, dog shrinks. You know, you kiss them in the mouth. You let them sleep with you. I mean, look at you and Max. <i>I mean, you have your own language. "Skiddley-wags. "</i> <i>Skiddley-Max. It's Skiddley-Max. Okay, sorry.</i> <i>Okay? Sorry, Max. It's okay.</i> Your neighbor, Lillian. And Miss Selina? I mean, come on. Every day that dog has on a new dress. I mean, I swear, she even puts lipstick on that dog. <i>Miss Lillian doesn't count. Yeah, well, I'm not buying that.</i> <i>I'm just not gonna buy it. Here, taste this.</i> Can you just do that one more time? <i>Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.</i> <i>You've gotta take your time and just appreciate certain things.</i> Like, ladies, look at all the beautiful black men in here. Just give all the black men a round of applause in here. <i>I'm talking about fine brothers up in here.</i> <i>'Cause, you know why I'm particularly fond of the black man?</i> Because society is just so hard on the black man. <i>All they say is, "The black man don't wanna work. "</i> <i>Then, when they do work, "They don't wanna take care of their kids. "</i> <i>Then when have kids, "They don't spend no quality time with them. "</i> But when they bring that to me, you know what I tell them? Well, what about the DC Sniper? This man spent quality time with his son. Took him to work with him. Taught him how to hunt. <i>You just can't judge a whole race of men by one incident, you know.</i> I love my black brothers. <i>That's why I ain't never dated outside of my race.</i> Never dated outside of my race. Never. Well, yes I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I dated an African once. Baby, he did it to me so good, I woke up with my hair braided, baby. It was bad. <i>But I ain't never dated a white man before.</i> <i>Not that I'm not attracted to white men.</i> <i>'Cause there's some fine-looking white men in here.</i> But my only problem with the white man is that. <i>y'all don't know how to break up with a woman.</i> I watch The Crime Channel. <i>You date them, you come up missing, don't you?</i> Everybody will be looking for you. <i>You'll be chopped up, in the freezer, in a sandwich bag.</i> <i>with a "barbeque" sign on your head.</i> <i>Y'all, my name is Sommore. Y'all have been great. Thank you.</i> <i>Wow, we've been to New Orleans, Charleston, the wine country.</i> You know where there is good food, Walter will travel. <i>Yeah. He's a true foodie.</i> <i>And I've gained five pounds, but I'm having a ball.</i> Hear ye! Hear ye! <i>Madam Judge here, would you'd ever thought she'd fall.</i> for somebody with an apron? Come on, Kenya. <i>Well, you showed me the light. Didn't you?</i> Well, looks like you two have been having fun. <i>And plus, I can't even reach Kenya.</i> She used to pick up on the first ring. So, do share. <i>Well, I've been. - I have a big account right now. So.</i> Yeah. Kenya. <i>Admit it, girl. You're having fun. I can tell.</i> Oh, wait. And before I forget, I got this on our last trip. <i>And now that you're into colors, I thought you might be able to use it.</i> <i>Thank you. You're welcome.</i> <i>It's beautiful. It's beautiful.</i> <i>That's my song. Come on, let's dance. Okay.</i> <i>Come on, y'all. Shake a tail feather now.</i> So, I hear you into gardening. <i>Yeah, yeah, that's right.</i> Like that jungle variety. The jungle what? The jungle variety. Look, man, do you do this with all your clients? Do you bring them out? No, not usually. Why? Because that woman, you see that woman? I love that woman. And Kenya love that woman. <i>She's like a sister to Kenya, so she's kind of like a sister-in-law to me.</i> <i>See what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, I think so.</i> <i>So we got her back. She's kind of like family.</i> You got that? Yeah, I got it. Good. Got what? You got what? Got milk. What was that about? It was just about you. <i>Here you go, Sommore. I'll be up at the bar.</i> Hey! Hey! Hey, baby. How are you doing? You did a good job. <i>Thank you. I'm glad y'all came.</i> This is my girl, Cheryl. Hi, how are you doing? Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. <i>That's Kenya. Hi, how are you? Hi.</i> <i>I'm Brian. Hi.</i> <i>I see y'all brought your night light with you.</i> Girl, either you getting your swirl on or you got your probation officer with you. <i>Well, I don't blame you.</i> I know all about these undisclosed liabilities. <i>And you're not concerned?</i> <i>Well, yeah, but did you see the receivables? They're right here.</i> <i>Yes, I've looked them over. Jack-</i> Look, I really need this IPO to happen. I know you do, but the deal has to make sense. Look, did you see this, Bill? Of course, Bill saw it. He prepared the document before I did the analysis. <i>Jack, I know you're anxious about this deal but I'm only protecting you.</i> Jack. Oh, Edwin. You still owe me a round of golf. I sure do. <i>Listen, why don't you take a minute and sit with us?</i> <i>I'd love to, but I have a meeting.</i> <i>You're in good hands. Kenya knows what she's doing.</i> <i>Well, after your meeting, why don't you stop back here and look at this?</i> Sure. Kenya, do you mind? Not at all. Jack values your feedback, and he should have it. <i>We're all here to serve the client.</i> I believe that. Watch this. Oh, my God! Wow! Brian. this is just incredible. <i>It's.</i> everything I ever wanted. and more. Thank you. Hard day? Annoying. This client is a trip. I have to go back into the office tomorrow. <i>and he's second guessing everything I do.</i> I have to double-check my work just in case. That old black tax again. Black tax? Yeah, you have to work twice as hard just to prove yourself equal. <i>You sure you're not being paranoid?</i> <i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i> <i>Okay. Then I'll work Saturday, too.</i> Hey. <i>Don't walk up on me like that, you don't know me.</i> Well, I thought you could use some help. Oh, man, you trying to steal my secrets over here. <i>That's what you trying to do.</i> You got me. You got me. I admit it. Well, you know what? You ought to feel real, real blessed. <i>that you're even invited to this negro spiritual.</i> <i>I am, Walter. You know what I'm saying?</i> Hey, Boo-boo. Talk to you later. Oh, hey. You look gorgeous. Hi. <i>Oh, there's Leah.</i> Leah! Paul! Hey, Paul. Hi. Hi, look at you guys. I am so psyched. <i>Well, I'm so psyched for you guys.</i> Wedding in a few weeks. Yeah. Hey, the place looks great. Thank you. I want to show you the fountain. <i>I've been telling her about the fountain. Yeah, yeah. Great.</i> Yeah, I really like what you did here. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. <i>It's a good space to work with. Can I get you a drink?</i> <i>Yes, sure. We'll just have a couple of sodas.</i> Two sodas. Coming right up. <i>That white guy's really nice.</i> Girl, honey, you let go all right. Working your natural hair, sporting your little boy-toy. <i>He's a doll, baby. He's a gardener.</i> <i>He's a good one, girl. Look at your flowers and blooms.</i> <i>Tony's cute. Divorced.</i> Well, not technically, but the separation is legal. Suzzette. I know, you guys, please. He came into my office cradling that feverish child. Those muscular arms. <i>He said, "Doctor, we need help. "</i> What was I supposed to do? Let go, let flow. Cheers! <i>The reality of it is a brother can't get no slack.</i> Now see, if a white boy had done that- Oh, please. He would have got a promotion. <i>What I'm saying. Give me some of that.</i> Are you guys talking about the black tax? Ahem. Drinks? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute, wait a minute. <i>My man! He's a spy.</i> He tried to con me out of a barbecue technique earlier today. I guess he gonna try to open up his own restaurant or something like that. <i>No. I'll be. Excuse me, yeah.</i> What is that police pat that you give me on the back all the time? Kenya! This looks like a bordello in Bangkok. Hi. Hi, sweetie. <i>I didn't think you'd make it. Dr. McQueen.</i> Dad! <i>Hello. I'm Brian.</i> Oh, the landscaper. Actually, Brian is my friend, Mother. Brian, good to meet you. Good to meet you too, sir. Oh, why did you cut your hair? It was your shining glory. It was a weave, Mother. Well, it suited you. Come on, take me in the house so I can freshen up. So, you did all this? Yeah, let me show you around. Kenya, look at this place. You have gone all bohemian, my dear. What on earth has gotten into you? Do not answer that. <i>I'm gonna tell Mama.</i> Hi, Nelson. Hi. Oh, my bad. Luna, this is my sister Kenya. Kenya, this is Luna. Hi. Hi. Listen to me. I think I found the one. <i>Well, that's great. Congratulations.</i> Oh, no, no, no. No, for you. I found your future husband. Yeah, my mentor in law school just moved into town. <i>Nelson, why don't you just stay out of my business?</i> Can you just do me a favor, and just check him out first? <i>I promise you, you are gonna thank me. You're gonna thank me.</i> And also I told him to come here tonight. What? Yeah, I called him like, yesterday. <i>Nelson, I'm gonna strangle you.</i> <i>You know what? It's too late, 'cause he's here.</i> This is for allowing me to crash your party. <i>I'm Mark Harper.</i> <i>What's up, baby boy? How are you, sir?</i> Mark gave me my first job as an intern. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Same here. Finally. <i>Nelson's been telling me about you for years now.</i> <i>I've talked about you for years. Yeah.</i> So, you just bought this place? Yeah, yeah. <i>It's nice.</i> <i>I just relocated from Phoenix, myself. I'm looking for a place.</i> So, maybe you can help me out. Show me some things. <i>I mean, I'm thinking you're probably an expert in the area by now.</i> Oh, well, I know a thing or two. <i>but I wouldn't call myself an authority or anything.</i> Oh. What? Look, my sister is just playing it down. She knows her stuff. and she could give you the numerical breakdown of anything. <i>Well, that's perfect 'cause that's just what I need.</i> How about next week? Can I let you know? No. No, of course. Of course, yeah. <i>Hey, you know what? Why don't we go check out the grill?</i> <i>No, I'm good, man. I'm good right here. I wanna show you the barbeque.</i> It was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Hey, baby. Hi. How are you? Good. <i>Who's that guy? Some friend of Nelson's.</i> Nice plant. Kenya! Bye. Bye. See you later. All right, guys. <i>So, we met Nelson's mentor.</i> Is that handsome or what? And well-spoken. He said that you were gonna show him around. Say good night, Joyce. We have to go. Young man, you did an interesting job on the garden. Oh, thank you. Yes, very good work. It was great talking to you, sir. Me, too. Did you get your cotillion invite? Yes. You must come. Senator Abamaus Leeds is- <i>We'll talk about it later, Mother.</i> Come on, come on. Good night. Good night. Good night. Bye. <i>So, what's a cotillion?</i> Seventeen years old. The debutante being presented to society. <i>I can't believe people still do that.</i> They take it seriously, too. <i>That's Mom and Dad.</i> My escort, David Fontaine. His father and mine went to med school together. My parents flew him out from Atlanta. <i>You couldn't find someone locally?</i> It was a big deal to my mother. <i>"Kenya Denise McQueen escorted by David Fontaine.</i> <i>"son of Dr. and Mrs. David Fontaine. "</i> Whatever. My grandfather passed away two years ago. And my nana still lives in Baltimore. <i>Well, they look like they're having fun. They lived for it.</i> It was the black high-society event of the year. So, you wanna go? <i>It's on the same night as the community garden party.</i> but I can blow that off. <i>I don't know. I think I'll skip this year.</i> Why? Because of me? <i>I'm a great ballroom dancer.</i> <i>I don't know. I just. I just don't think we'd be comfortable.</i> We or you? <i>Come on, let's go to bed.</i> We both have to work tomorrow, remember? Yeah, I do. Kenya! Hey, Edwin. <i>Listen, I'm sorry about that business with Jack Pino the other day.</i> <i>I know he's being an ass. But, as you said, we're here to serve the client.</i> and sometimes that means putting egos aside. Absolutely. <i>We knew you could handle it. You're a pro.</i> Thanks. Thank you. Walter gave me the secret to his famous grilled salmon. Want to try it? <i>Whatever's fine.</i> You all right? <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i> <i>The white boys at the plantation are getting on my last nerve, that's all.</i> Could we put the white boys on hold for tonight? The white folks. The brothers, the sisters. All of them. What are you saying? <i>Just not tonight, babe. I, you know. I had a rough day, too.</i> I need to get home and relax. <i>You're asking me to not talk about race? No, I didn't say that.</i> You expect me to be in this relationship with you and never bring it up? What? We talk about it all the time. I just said, not right now. When? When is appropriate? <i>When we're at home behind closed doors, when we're just joking about it?</i> No, just not all the time. All right? It just makes me feel uncomfortable. <i>I'm sorry, but I wasn't brought up that way.</i> <i>First of all, you don't have to talk about being white.</i> <i>because no one reminds you every day that you're white.</i> <i>The only time you guys know you're white.</i> <i>is when you're in a room full of black people. I'm in a room full of.</i> <i>I'm in a world full of white people, and every day they remind me that I'm black.</i> <i>And if I can't talk to you about my frustrations.</i> <i>if I'm just supposed to keep that to myself - Kenya, hold on.</i> <i>You're a senior manager at one of the whitest firms in the country. All right?</i> <i>You graduated top of your class from Stanford and Wharton, for Christ's sake.</i> You own a home. You earn more money than what? black or white. Certainly more than me. <i>So, you know, tell me about your frustrations, 'cause I'm listening.</i> <i>No, you don't want to hear it. You don't want to hear about.</i> how when I show up at an account meeting. <i>they always have to regroup when they find out I'm the one.</i> <i>who's responsible for their multi-million-dollar acquisition.</i> <i>They'd rather trust it to a file clerk.</i> <i>The guy who gets me my goddamn coffee, because he's white.</i> Do you know how insulting that is? <i>They're jerks. Forget them, baby. They're jerks.</i> They have nothing to do with us. They have nothing to do with us. <i>Brian, if I can't talk to you about the black shit that drives me crazy.</i> or the white shit that drives me crazy. <i>if I'm just supposed to keep that to myself. Brian! And deny who I am-</i> <i>No, I've never asked you to deny anything. All I wanted, all I wanted was a night off.</i> <i>That's what being black is about, Brian. You don't get a night off.</i> You know what? <i>I'm never gonna be on the right side of the war going on inside your head.</i> <i>'cause I'm not black. All right? I'm never gonna be black.</i> <i>So maybe this isn't what you want. Maybe it just isn't gonna work.</i> <i>Maybe it's not.</i> <i>Hi. Hey, Kenya. Did I catch you at a bad time?</i> I can really see myself here. It is nice. But I think the asking price is a little too high for the area. I would bid at about 80 grand less. <i>And when the broker asks you what you think, don't be too enthusiastic.</i> Wait till tomorrow to make your offer. Okay. Okay. So, how are you two doing? I like it. Very good. And Mrs. Harper? <i>Oh, no. I'm - Mrs. Harper has her questions.</i> <i>But we'll get back to you tomorrow with our final answer.</i> Sounds good. You have my card. Yeah. Thank you. Mrs. Harper. Take care. Enough about me. So, how are the good old boys treating you down at the plantation? Oh, you know them. Fond of testing us. Oh, yeah. The old black tax. But we play the game. <i>We do what we gotta do to get ahead. Don't we?</i> We sure do. So, how often do you get home to St. Louis? Every once in a while. <i>Well, it seems like I'm tied to my desk lately, though. I work most weekends.</i> <i>Haven't been able to go anywhere. And they got me up for partner now.</i> I know all about that. You up for partner, too? You? You got it going, there, girl! Two partners. Watch out. Dang! <i>You know, I hope this isn't too forward.</i> but I would really like to spend some real time with you. <i>But no, no, I've got to say, now, I'm not one of these LA guys.</i> lots of women, the whole fast lifestyle, all that. I like to keep it nice and simple. One lady at a time. <i>I'm thinking about the future right now.</i> <i>So what's going on with you, Kenya? You got a man? You seeing somebody?</i> Now? No. Not really, no. <i>That's what I wanna hear.</i> <i>Yes, Mother. I'm picking the dress up tomorrow.</i> Okay. Yes. <i>Mother, I'll call you back. Okay.</i> Max! You gonna let me in? <i>I haven't heard from you in two weeks.</i> <i>Don't you think you should have called first?</i> <i>Well, I thought I'd just show up.</i> <i>You're right. I'm sorry. I should have called first.</i> <i>The reason you haven't heard from me is 'cause.</i> well, to be honest, I felt stupid. I should have just listened to you that day. All you needed was a shoulder, not another critic. <i>I don't know where my head was that day.</i> I had a guy walk off the job, and I guess I was feeling a little frustrated. I wanna be there for you, Kenya. I really do. And we can talk. We can talk about whatever you like. <i>I may not always relate, but I can promise I'll empathize.</i> Can you trust that? <i>'Cause it'd be a terrible shame to let something so superficial get in our way.</i> <i>Just give up because it's challenging sometimes.</i> <i>I mean, aren't we both up to the challenge?</i> Kenya, I love you. <i>I don't know what to say.</i> Should I give you a hint? Look, I met someone else. <i>It's not like I went out looking or anything. It just happened.</i> <i>Let me guess. He's black?</i> It is not only that. We have more in common. A suit-and-tie guy? Yeah. <i>Let's go, Max. Come on, let's go.</i> <i>I didn't mean for this to happen.</i> <i>Don't worry. We were just. We were just hanging out, right?</i> Right. <i>Look, I'll put the check for the landscaping in the mail.</i> <i>No, don't. Don't.</i> Take care. You got to keep everything loose. Got to keep your knees loose. Keep your hips loose. Keep everything loose. Like that, all right? What does this have to do with hitting the ball? This is how you gotta get the motion. You gotta get the feel. <i>Know what I'm saying? Bounce with me. Bounce with it.</i> Look at that. Look at that. There you go, girl. Keep your knees loose. Three things. <i>There's the back swing.</i> <i>There's the contact.</i> <i>And then there's the follow-through.</i> Now follow through, let me see how you do that. Like that. Good. All right, you got it. Okay. This is great, right? <i>Thank you. You're doing a great job, young man.</i> <i>We're supposed to do this. Hey, little man.</i> <i>Thank you. No, it's for you.</i> Oh, for me? Yeah. <i>This is Leah's family synagogue, right? Yeah, I guess so.</i> You need to get a yarmulke. Kenya. Hello. This is Penelope, Kenya. <i>You're Penelope. It's nice to meet you.</i> I love your dress. Thanks. <i>Oh, I'm sorry. This is. This is Mark.</i> Brian. How are you doing? Hi. <i>So, you two got back together. That's nice.</i> Yeah. <i>Well, it's good to see you.</i> Okay, maybe I should call a doctor. <i>No, no. It's nothing.</i> <i>My asthma just comes back at the oddest times. That's all. It'll pass.</i> Okay, what is this about? Is this about Brian? Brian? No, no, no. But can you believe, he had the nerve to show up with that white woman? Last time I checked, Brian was white, too. And it is over, right? You broke up with him, right? <i>Okay, you know what, guys? Maybe we shouldn't talk about this here.</i> <i>'cause this is a rabbi's study.</i> <i>I don't think it's too cool for us to be in here.</i> <i>Look, girl, pull it together. Don't let Mark see you like this.</i> How could he? It was so easy for him to just get back with her like it was nothing. <i>Aren't you forgetting something? You've got a man, too.</i> A fine, successful, black man. Okay? <i>You're right. What am I saying? Mark's wonderful.</i> Mark is fine. Yes. <i>He's your IBM, right? Right. Right.</i> <i>I mean, let's get real here, okay.</i> Brian is cute and all that, but he is a white boy. Oh, come on, Kenya, please! I mean, were you really gonna go the distance? Honestly? Be honest with yourself. You always get in your own way. This is what you do. <i>You've got a lot of nerve talking about going the distance.</i> screwing married men! Okay, okay. Enough. <i>What happened to "Let go, let flow?" Good luck.</i> <i>Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.</i> <i>It's fine. It is true though, girl.</i> Go deal with them demons. <i>Look, it's not about going the distance. Okay?</i> <i>'Cause you guys said that Walter and I weren't gonna make it.</i> And we tighter than ever. <i>Kenya, I don't know what your problem is, girl, but Mark is a catch.</i> <i>And if you don't know what to do with him, girl, pass him on to me.</i> <i>'cause I will show you what to do with him.</i> <i>I'll marry his ass quick and give him a shitload of babies.</i> Black, ashy babies. Our Sunday dinners have been a tradition since our first year of marriage. Right, Edmond? Right, Joyce. <i>It's the only day I'm guaranteed a home-cooked meal.</i> So, Mark, I understand your father owns an insurance brokerage. <i>That's bedrock.</i> So your parents, how long have they been married? Baby, you wanna ask him for his social security number, too? <i>It's just a question.</i> <i>Forty-five years. They're my role models.</i> Oh, how sweet! Next year we will celebrate our 35th. Dr. McQueen is the adventurer. and I am, how should I say. the voice of reason. <i>It's a good balance.</i> <i>He's always encouraging me to try new things.</i> <i>and of course, I'm always saying, "No, thank you. "</i> <i>I had to show them who's boss. You know what I mean?</i> Hell yes, I do. <i>So did Lauren happen to Lana? And who's lined up to happen to Lauren?</i> The last girl I was with, her name was Luna. Yeah, and Lauren did happen to her. <i>And Lauren might actually be the one. Check out her stats. She's fine.</i> She is an optician, and she owns her own place. The odds are definitely in her favor. Stats? Stats. Is that how you decide to have a relationship with someone? <i>I'm just trying to keep up with you, big sis.</i> Mark is a great move. You did good. You did. <i>Mrs. McQueen, you'll like this story.</i> I convinced your daughter to go out with me. by suggesting she accompany me house-hunting. <i>I told her I needed the accountant's perspective, now.</i> What I did not tell her was as a tax lawyer myself. I already knew the numbers. <i>Yeah. Yeah, that's me. They call me the numbers man.</i> But can you blame me? You gotta use what you got. Mark, that is so cute. Thank you. And if things keep going well. <i>in six months from now, who knows what we'll be celebrating.</i> Right, Kenya? Oh, my God. Oh, Mark. Oh, my! Oh, my God! <i>Let's just forget the coffee and pop some champagne.</i> <i>Oh, my God!</i> You know. I love that picture of you, at your folks, with the long hair. You know which one? You should let it grow. <i>I can't. I can't do this.</i> Kenya, Kenya, Kenya. Am I going too fast? Kenya, wait, wait, wait. <i>Kenya. Hey, come on. I'll put you in the guest room, all right?</i> <i>If you're not ready, it's all right. It's all right. I understand. No pressure.</i> <i>In fact, I will. I will wait for you as long as you want.</i> <i>Okay, I'll drive you home. No, I'll drive myself.</i> <i>Why? I can't do this.</i> <i>You're a great guy.</i> Perfect. <i>But this just isn't right for me.</i> I hope you understand. Wait, was it something I said? Something I did? <i>No, not at all. You've been wonderful. It's me.</i> <i>I'm just looking for something.</i> <i>I don't know what it is, really, but it's not here.</i> <i>Just like that. I'm sorry.</i> Shit. Shit. Shit. <i>I'm so stupid.</i> Maybe I just made the biggest mistake of my life. He was fine and smart. But there was no fizzle. No magic. <i>I don't know. Kenya, look, don't beat yourself up.</i> You gotta listen to your instincts. Yeah, but what if my instincts are screwed up? Your instincts are fine. You did a brave thing. You let your heart do the talking, not your parents. not society, not black people, not your girls. You decided for you, honey. So, you gonna give Brian a call? This is not about Brian. <i>I mean, it would be if he were black, but he's not. That's just the reality.</i> Look, Kenya, as a black man. I must say, I was a little suspicious of the guy, when I first met him. <i>But at the end of the day it's not about skin color or race.</i> <i>It's about the love connection.</i> <i>The vibe that's between a man and a woman.</i> Does he make you feel loved, he make you laugh. he make you just wanna forget about all the bullshit and just enjoy life? <i>Because if that's what you have with Brian.</i> <i>Baby, I don't know when you're gonna wake up to that.</i> It is my recommendation that the Pino Group. not acquire Net Worth Consolidated. <i>You don't want this company, Jack.</i> <i>I'm not gonna paint a pretty picture by being creative with the numbers.</i> and I will not stand with the firm in recommending you purchase it. <i>I'm sorry, but that's my position.</i> This is not what I wanted to hear. Kenya, do you think we could have a moment alone with Jack? Sure. Got the 10-K of SEC filings for Kate Blanchard. <i>I've also got a bottle of tequila in my desk.</i> <i>Darren, I'm fine.</i> Can I have a word with you? Sure. That was quite a show you put on back there, Kenya. <i>And that's precisely what we want at this firm.</i> Guts, smarts, integrity. Without your good judgment, this firm would have made a big mistake. Outstanding work, Kenya. Thanks. <i>Now, you know the vote's tonight, but let me be the first to congratulate you.</i> partner. <i>I've made partner?</i> <i>You've made partner.</i> <i>Oh, well, that's great!</i> I told you we had our eye on you. Oh, my goodness! <i>Your input is invaluable to this firm. We're very lucky to have you.</i> I appreciate that. Congratulations. Edwin. Actually, I have one request. <i>What's that?</i> One weekend a month is untouchable. No cell phone, no email. Just my time. I think we can handle that. Ladies, are you ready to keep up with me tonight? <i>'Cause I'm gonna keep both of you on the dance floor till you say.</i> <i>"Please, big Daddy, I can't take no more. "</i> <i>Oh, Edmond, really! Hey, Kenya, isn't that Cheryl?</i> Wow. <i>You look gorgeous. Cheryl! I didn't even recognize you.</i> You look beautiful! You are positively glowing. Thank you, Mrs. McQueen. <i>You know, maybe it's because of this.</i> Oh, my God! Details, details. Well, it was a total surprise. <i>I'm dropping him off at the airport. He gets down on one knee and bam!</i> I mean, I was expecting something nice. But this? And he picked it out all by himself. My goodness! <i>Nelson, I hope you're taking notes.</i> <i>You don't have to worry about that.</i> <i>It's gorgeous. Isn't it, Kenya?</i> Yes it is, Mother. <i>We'll talk later. And remember what I said the other night.</i> You okay? <i>I'm fine. Okay.</i> <i>Introducing Miss Deavon Frost.</i> <i>Parents are Dr. and Mrs. Malcolm Frost.</i> <i>Escorted by Sidney Baldwin, son of the Honorable Stanley Baldwin.</i> <i>Introducing Miss Rene Atkins.</i> <i>Parents are Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Atkins.</i> <i>.Mr. and Mrs. David Hunter III, Esq.</i> Slow down. This is so silly. <i>I can't believe I ever took this seriously.</i> I mean, really, what are we trying to prove with this? That our little princesses can grow up and marry little princes, too? As long as they both have the right pedigree. <i>they're guaranteed to live happily ever after.</i> I mean, how shallow is that? <i>Don't believe the hype, girls! It ain't what it's cracked up to be.</i> Kenya! You stop that! Go on, girls. Better pretend while you can. I have had enough! You have done nothing but embarrass us all evening. <i>Embarrass you. I'm embarrassing you? Yes.</i> Complaining and carrying on. Blaming everyone but the one responsible for your unhappiness. <i>Yourself. Perhaps it's time you faced that.</i> Thanks, Mother. Kenya. <i>I shouldn't have said that.</i> Sweet pea. There comes a time in life when we have to strike out on our own. <i>And we. Whoa.</i> <i>Don't worry about me. I'm a doctor.</i> And a father. <i>I've seen it all, heard it all.</i> Handle your business. <i>Kenya, you don't have to tell me you have a thing for Brian.</i> It was all over your face and in your voice. <i>Daddy, it's over. Please, don't.</i> I know love when I see it. <i>Plus, I talked to him. He's a good guy.</i> If you have feelings for him, you need to do something about that. <i>But, Daddy.</i> <i>You know how your mother always says that I'm the adventurer.</i> <i>Well, did you know that when we met I didn't have a pot to piss in?</i> I never told you this. but your grandparents threatened to disown her if she married me. But she defied them and we ran off together. <i>We didn't know how we were gonna make it. But we did.</i> And her folks eventually came around. The point is, love is an adventure, Kenya. <i>It's not a decision you make for others.</i> <i>It's a decision you make from the heart.</i> <i>Anyway, the boy is just white. He ain't a Martian.</i> <i>I mean, folks carry on like we're some kind of pure race.</i> <i>that shouldn't be diluted, huh?</i> But look at us, all of us in this country. <i>Black, white, brown, yellow. We're all mixed up.</i> Mutts. All of us. Nothing pure about us. I wish I had a father like that. <i>Sorry, I don't lend him out. Not even on special occasions.</i> <i>Hello, valet, can you get me a cab? Yes, ma'am.</i> Hey, where you going? To get Brian back. <i>What? That's right, Brian.</i> <i>'Cause you know what? I happen to love him.</i> <i>Don't make love wait. Take my car.</i> Take my whip. Take it, take it, take it. Just be easy on the 22s. Be easy on the 22s. Come on, now! Oh, no! Hi. Hi. By any chance, have you seen Brian? <i>Brian, I think he's gone, honey.</i> Thank you. Max, I missed you. Hi, Maxie. Hi. Hi. Hey. <i>Look, I know you must think I'm combative.</i> <i>neurotic, picky. And maybe I am.</i> But the weird thing is. <i>I've never had to be anyone but myself with you.</i> right from the beginning. And with you I feel like I can do anything. say anything, try anything. <i>And that's the life I want.</i> I want an adventure with you. <i>You don't understand. We're supposed to be together.</i> <i>I'm never gonna be your dream man, Kenya.</i> <i>I just. I won't be the fall-back guy.</i> <i>No. See, that's the thing.</i> <i>I don't have to wonder about that anymore. I know this is right.</i> Dreams change. Hey, when I was younger, my dream was to marry Rick James. <i>You're the one I want, Brian.</i> I love you. I love you, Kenya. <i>I've never stopped loving you.</i> <i>Oh, wait, wait. We have to go right now. There's not much time left.</i> Where? What are we doing? Do you know that guy with the guitar? Aw, shucks! Look at him! Oh, my God. Photo-op, photo-op, photo-op! Everybody look at the photographer! I found her, Daddy!

There's nothing to be afraid of in this whole pretty world, Bobby. l'm here. All is well, yes? This is where we live. -l can see our house from here. -Come on down, man. l can see the school too! -Come on. -l can see tomorrow from here. How's it look? Pretty. Big, pretty world, man. Everything can happen. -Hey, guys. -Hi, lsabel. Lou! Jerry! Hi, how are you? What are you drinking? Oh, Mr. Right, if you were only 30 years older..

Oh, come on. -No, no! -Stop that. -No, no, no! -Don't be an asshole, man. -Don't fuck things up. -Go on. Carlton, don't say ''fuck.'' Fuck you. Mom needs a break tonight, buddy. Your mission is to pass as a 9-year-old till further notice. But l'm missing everything. There's always more, pal. -A flying saucer. -What? There's a flying saucer. lt's above the back yard! lt's gonna land! So where is it? -You mean that airplane? -l know what an airplane looks like. You're an idiot, Frank. Hey, aliens! Come back! l'm ready to go home now! Hello, beautiful. Carlton! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. -Somebody call an ambulance! -You're gonna be all right, okay? My baby! Oh, my God, my baby! You're gonna be all right. lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay. -Hey, man. -Hi. High school. Yeah. Nice jacket. Thanks. Hey, man. Oh, hi. Wanna smoke a joint? Well, l guess so. Yes. Let's go. l don't think this is working. Be patient, man. This is definitely not working. l feel just like l always do. So, Bobby, you new in town? No, sir. l've been here all my life. Just been sort of invisible. -Well, welcome to the material world. -Well, thank you, sir. You made this bread? Bread's a hobby of mine. l can just about do it in my sleep. So, what's your father do? -He's a teacher, over at Fillmore. -Your mother, does she work? No. l mean she died last year. Oh, l'm so sorry. You shouldn't be sorry. You didn't even know her. Well, l-- l meant.. l meant it in a more general way. l meant l'm-- l'm sorry for your loss. This is really good bread. l really like your jacket. lt's my brother's. lt's cool. He died too. You wanna borrow it? Here, go on. lt fits you, man. Wait a minute. Here. Take this. Fits. Hey, Dad. -Boys? -Shit! Come on in, Mrs. Glover. Sorry to intrude. l was just wondering, what's that music? lt's Laura Nyro. Well nobody wants a mother hanging around. Bye, Mom. Put that out. Please. You boys are gonna get into trouble. Mrs. Glover. You've been so nice to me. l was wondering.. You want a hit? l do not. There's nothing to fear. lt's all goodness. l'm Jonathan's mother. -Bobby, l don't really think-- -But you're also like.. Don't you dare tell your father. What do l do? Just pull the smoke straight into your lungs. That always happens. Here, try again. Good. That's good. Now hold it. What.? What will it do, exactly? l mean, what should l prepare myself for? lt'll just make you laugh, make you feel, you know, happy and a little foolish. Mrs. Glover? This is so cool. She sounds so sad. She's the goddess. l heard her singing, and l just-- l don't know. She just sounds so beautiful and lonely. Mom? Oh, thanks, dear. We're all, you know, beautiful and lonely here. Come on, let's dance. No. -Absolutely not. -Can't take no. Look what you're making an old lady do. -You're a good dancer. -Well, l used to be in the early Pleistocene. Bobby, if you get cold, there's a comforter in the hall closet. -Thanks, Mrs. Glover. -Okay. -Good night, Mom. -Good night. The Stones are coming in March. We've gotta get tickets. We should go all three nights. Dad? Dad, it's getting late. My angel. -You poor baby. -Thanks. Sure thing. So that's it, man. l'm like the last of my kind now. No, you're not. l wish l'd been with him. lt's all right. Oh, mama, no. Life can't be this good. Your father took me to see this on our second or third date. -Blessings on our Friday. -What do you want to do? -Something huge. -There's nothing huge around here. -You took your dad's car? -Just a little spin, man. Hey, can l hitch a ride? Shit! Get out of here! Get out of here right now! -Shit. Shit. -Jon. Jon. -l gotta go. -This is where you live. This is all fucked up. l guess we let things get-- -l mean-- -lt's love, man. -lt's just love. -We got carried away and l think we should stop. l mean, pretty soon we'll be out of high school. Then we'll be in college. And l want to go to college in a big city. -You're gonna go away? -As soon as l can. You're awake. l just-- l wanted a drink of water. l couldn't sleep either, so l decided l might as well do something useful. Maybe l shouldn't stay here anymore. l'm not innocent in all this, Bobby. l can't pretend to be. l honestly don't know what to do. l'm supposed to be the mother. l'm the adult here and l honestly don't have the slightest idea what to do or say to either one of you. l should go l guess. Want to learn how to make a pie? Sometimes it's good to just do a simple, useful thing. -l don't know. -l haven't rolled out the second crust yet. lt's not like bread dough. You mold that until it comes to life. Pie crust is just the opposite. lt needs kid gloves. You handle it as little as possible. You'd be surprised how easy it is once you learn a few of the tricks. Just coax it. That's right. That's good. That's very good. At least Alice and l will never have to suffer through another Cleveland winter. You'll do better in Arizona, Ned. Yep. New beginnings. Just wish it wasn't so far. No, man, Jonathan can just hop in a plane from New York any time, and l'll be there. Bobby son you can't move to Arizona with Alice and me. Son, you're 24. -You can't just live with us forever. -l know. l mean-- Time to get out in the world a little. <i>No one's home. Leave a message.</i> Hey, Jonnie. Sorry, man, l'm not used to these things. l'm calling to tell you-- Well, to ask you, really.. You see, Ned and Alice are moving to Arizona and l'm just here. To tell you the truth, man, l'm not sure what to do. lt seems like l've just been baking for so long. <i>Bobby?</i> -You're here. -l can't believe it, man. You're here. -How was your trip? -lt was a trip. Your new home. Welcome to the Tarantula Arms. l know, it's a lot. Hey, man, you got bootleg Dylan. -ls he here? -He's here. Welcome, Bobby. Bobby, Clare, about whom you've heard so much. -Hi. -l am so glad to finally meet you. Me too. You. Thanks for letting me, you know, crash here for a while. Well, come on. Grab your things, get settled in. Come, Jonathan. l like a little respite from all the décor. You wanna go out to dinner, or do you want to unpack first? l mostly brought, you know records. -Let's go out. -Okay. -Have fun, boys. -You come too. Well, l-- No. You guys need a little time alone, l think. No, really. Come. Okay. l'll just put on my other eye, and we're out of here. -Bobby is adorable! -He is, isn't he, in his Bobby way. -Why are all the good ones gay? -Bobby's not gay. Well, it's hard to say exactly what Bobby is. You want another beer? Yeah. Come on! Tomorrow, l'm taking you up to Central Park. lnside a week, you'll have the whole city figured out. Hey, man. -What? -You got a tattoo. Yeah, years ago, at NYU. l thought l could be the kind of person who'd have a tattoo. Cool. Bobby. l feel like there are things we should talk about. -.but l'm not sure what to say. -What things? You know, when we were kids what we used to do. Man, we were kids. -So are you seeing anyone in Cleveland? -No. l'm.. l was just, you know, working, hanging out. How about you? -You seeing anybody? -No. No one in particular. Hey, man. Look what someone was throwing out. Hey, Leonard C. Right out there on the street, along with dead spider plants and macramé. How many times did we get stoned to this? l lost count. Hey, man, l'm making lasagna. We could knock off a bottle of Chianti and listen to ''Suzanne,'' like, 1 0 times. -Sorry, l've got a date. -No problemo. Save some for me. You have to promise to make this, at most, once a year. Bobby, if l weigh 300 pounds, l won't be able to get up the stairs. Too bad Jonathan has to miss it. Well, Jonathan has other priorities. And it was the best. We were out of our minds. -You had a good time? -The best. The best. You know how sometimes it seems like the DJ knows you? That's what l'm talking about. This is one of my sadness albums. -After my divorce. -You were married? Years ago. He was a sadistic drug addict and l was, well, a masochistic, aspiring drug addict. -lt made sense, at the time. -Where'd you meet him? -Want a real laugh? Woodstock. -You were at Woodstock? -Like, the concert? -Well, l don't tell just anybody, Bobby. -What was it like? -Muddy. You never seen so much mud. l felt like a pig. l was attracted to Denny because he had a bar of Lifebuoy soap down at the pond. -Hey, have you ever heard Steve Reich? -No. lt's one of my favorites. Listen. l just sort of catch whatever happens to blow through. Hey, beauties. Hello, dear. You're home early. Yeah, l was having a little less than maximum fun. Well, as you know, we always leave the porch light on for you. Love that. -Jonnie, have you heard this guy? -Steve Reich. -Sure. -He's great. He's amazing. He's just-- He's.. -Where'd you find him anyway? -He found me. He's a welcome addition to the household. Bobby, you'll have to find a job, aren't you? l'm a baker. Think a New York bakery would hire me? ln New York, someone will pay you to do just about anything. lf l make a living making hats-- She doesn't exactly make a living making hats. She picks up a little change that way. That is not true. l do have some money left over from my grandfather but l've stashed it for when the baby comes. -You're having a baby? -Didn't Jonathan tell you? -lt hasn't come up. -l didn't know you two were-- Lovers? We're not. Most parents aren't lovers. Mine weren't. l know this must sound a little.. A little what? A little free? A little great? A little like insisting on our own happiness even if it's not what people ordinarily do? Well.. Babies. l mean, hey, let's have a dozen. -Shit, you scared me. -Sorry, man. What are you doing? l get up and walk around in the dark sometimes. -Does that weird you out? -No. l don't know. When the place is all dark when you and Clare have gone to sleep, and l'm awake it's like being alive and being dead at the same time, you know? lt's this sort of halfway thing where the people who are alive are dreaming and the people who are dead are where they are. And l'm here in the dark and the quiet. You want some water? Sure. -Are you and Clare really having a baby? -Oh, God. l don't know. We've been talking about it. lt's something she really wants. l like Clare. So do l. -Bye, Lacey. -See you. We can take it from there if we need to. -And on the Thursday ad, we can-- -Oh, shit. l gotta go. -Can you--? -Yeah, l got it. -Thank you. -Bye, Jonathan.

Hey, Wes. -These are my friends Clare and Bobby. -Pleasure, Wes. So, Jonathan, Bobby and l'll see you later. -l thought we were all having dinner. -All right, l'll see you later. Do you know what l think? Now, can Clare be absolutely honest with you? l think you need a new haircut. Really? You're so handsome, and that hippie do does absolutely nothing for you. l don't know. -l never really, you know, think about it. -Well, l do. See, here's the thing you don't look like yourself this way. You know what l'm saying? lf you look like someone other than who you are you could get the wrong job and friends, who knows what. -You may end up with someone's whole life. -l think this is my life. -lt doesn't seem like somebody else's. -Check. What do you think? -l look so-- -Dangerous? Sexy? -Stripped down, ready for action? -That's not what l was thinking, exactly. Well, you are definitely gonna start turning heads around here now. Bobby. -.what do you like about me? -What? Do you.? -Do you like me? -l like you. Of course l like you. l mean, could you.? You know, do you have.? God, l can't believe you're gonna make me say it. Do you think l'm attractive? l.. That's what l thought you were gonna ask. And, yes, l-- Absolutely, l do. Good. That's good. Well, there's just no smooth or sophisticated way to do this, is there? Clare. No, listen. You talk too much, darling. lf you don't shut up, l will come to my senses and realize how stupid and self-destructive this is. l have to tell you, l've never you know done this before. -Pardon me? -l've never you know.. -Never? -No. Does that freak you out? No. l mean, yes, of course it freaks me out! Jesus Christ. l guess maybe we should stop. Maybe. Because, you know l may not be the most, like adept. Oh, honey. You think l'm upset because you might not be adept? -ls that what you think? -No. l guess. Okay, junior mama's gonna teach you a thing or two. Are you nervous? Don't be. This is the most natural thing in the world. All right. lt's all right. Sorry l missed dinner. Where is everybody? Jonnie are you okay? Are you okay? l guess. -You should go back to Clare. -No, man l don't wanna leave you alone. You should go back to Clare. Really. Bobby? Lovey, wakey, wakey! l am not here. You never saw me. l'm just the cleaning lady. So sorry. You were in bed. We tucked you in at 2 a.m. l went out again. -Fun? -Sort of. Potential? l don't think so. So, what do we do now--? -See you later, babies. -Jonnie-- Oh, it's entirely fine. There's a whole world full of art boys just outside. No worries. Love you. Hey, man. What are you doing up here? Some queen next door's got Mozart cranked. l couldn't tear myself away. Opera, huh? Clare loves you. l love Clare. Doesn't this all seem sort of strange? No, man, it's perfect. Just like this. Bobby, l'm starting to feel a little extra. You're essential, man. Let's dance. -You can't dance to opera. -You can dance to anything. What are you doing? A little kiss between brothers. Nothing wrong with that. Jon? Jonnie? Clare! Clare, wake up! What? Jonathan you asshole! God. We gotta find him. Honey, he isn't lost. He left. lt's my fault. This is not true. No, you don't understand. Bobby this is a problem of Jonathan's. -Trust me. -There's something fucked up about me. There is nothing fucked up about you. You don't know. -<i>Hello?</i> -Hi, Alice? <i>Bobby, is</i> t<i>ha</i>t <i>you, honey?</i> l don't wanna worry you, but have you heard from Jonathan? Of course. He's here. Do you wanna talk to him? <i>He's</i> t<i>here? Grea</i>t<i>, pu</i>t <i>him on.</i> Bobby, l'm sorry, it looks like he's gone to bed already. -But l'll tell him you called, okay? -<i>Tell him Clare and I are fine.</i> Okay, sweetheart, l will. Bye-bye. Do you like it here? Here l can, more or less, breathe the air and your mother's learned how to make blue margaritas. Whoever expected to end up living in the desert? Yeah, whoever expects to end up living anywhere? That's too deep for me. How's that? Looks a little bit like me, doesn't it? We're not speaking to anybody right now. <i>Happy holidays.</i> <i>Celebra</i>t<i>e, all you people.</i> <i>Hello, Bobby,</i> t<i>his is Alice.</i> <i>Swee</i>t<i>hear</i>t<i>,</i> t<i>here's some</i>t<i>hing</i> <i>I have</i> t<i>o</i> t<i>ell you.</i> Oh, look at you. And this is Clare. Oh, Clare. lt's so wonderful to finally meet you. -Thanks for coming. -Thank you for having me. Alice, sorry. Alice? -So clumsy. -l'll get it. lt's all right, they cost a $ 1 .98 at Kmart. Alice. Do something for me. -Anything. -Hold me. Just hold me. Okay. Tighter. Don't be gentle with me. Squeeze me harder. Harder. Make me feel like you're breaking my ribs. -Oh, God. -l can't. l don't wanna hurt you. l love you. -You're an angel. -Mom? l'll be right there, honey. Anybody want a drink? -Okay, sure. -Okay. l'm sorry about-- Well, all this. l knew l'd see you both again. l just imagined well different circumstances. lt's okay. lt's okay. Ned, man he was a trip. He was like my father too. You would have loved him, Clare. -l'm sure. -Bobby? lf you want my family so badly, l hereby bequeath them to you. No. No, better yet, l hereby bequeath you my whole entire life. Be me. l hereby dub you Jonathan Glover. Tomorrow, when they cremate my father's body you can be the son, and l'll be the best friend. You can come back from the service and console my mother. Jonathan, stop it. You're better at it than l am. You're better qualified. So go at it. -.be their son with my blessings. -Listen to me, you little shit. All he's ever done is worship you. All you've done is walk out on him. Don't you dare speak to him like that. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know the first thing about worship. Do you know? Do you have any idea how much l--? Listen, you guys-- How much l wanted you? How much l loved you, you asshole? You know, and then, what an idiot l am. How pathetic is that? Me, in love with you. Then Bobby comes along and l fall in love with this one, then l think that we-- That the three of us, maybe we could-- Fuck it. Just leave me alone and go back to the house and have a drink. Clare! How could you just leave without saying anything?! l couldn't be the uncle anymore. Give me a break, okay? -Clare, hey. -Don't call me that. What, don't call you what? Your name? What did you think l would do without you, Jonathan? -What were you thinking? -Clare, come on. l'm pregnant, you fuckers! What? Are you sure? l'm completely sure. You wanted this, didn't you? God help me. Clare. -Oh, man. -You think? Yes. Yes. What do you think about ''Ethan'' for a boy, or ''Trevor''? -Let's not get fancy. -lf it's a girl, call her ''Clare Jr.'' One Clare per family is enough. -What will the kid call Bobby and me? -l never thought of that. ''Daddy.'' Like ''Daddy One'' and ''Daddy Two''? -We're gonna have to move, aren't we? -Right. Funny family will need a third bedroom. Funny family may need a whole new neighborhood. Somewhere where two out of three people passing by are not psychotic? -Exactly. -How about Cleveland? -No! -Let's move here. -Please repeat what you just said. -lt's too hard to raise a kid in the city. Don't you think? What if the kid turned out to be some sort of, l don't know, Heidi. How much goodness do we want? Growing up in the country doesn't doom anyone to good behavior. Most of the interesting murderers come from derelict farms. This is so adult, looking at real estate. -We are adults, sort of. -Who would the kid play with out here? Woodland creatures, like Snow White. l don't want him hanging with squirrels. They have personality disorders. Stop it! This one has a great soul, don't you think? Baby? -lt's your money. -lt's my grandfather's money. -l didn't earn a dime of it. -Still. You'd be the owner. What do you think? You really want this, don't you? lf you do. lf we all do. No, you, Bobby Morrow. Beautiful, crazy boy. -You want this, and l could get it for you. -No, it'd be for us. So long, treasures. l'm thinking white here. Totally white, like a Shinto shrine and we can hang paper lanterns all over. -You are the gayest human being ever. -Somebody's gotta be gay around here. What do you like? l think l'm gonna go and fix a window. Okay. Jonathan, blue is your friend. See, blue is the color of sky and water. -Yeah, but white goes with everything. -Well, honey, it's a house, not an outfit. -lt's all right, l'll do it. -No, sleep. lt's my night. lt's okay, Bobby's doing it. lt's his night. lf we don't keep to the schedule, we'll all be exhausted by tomorrow. -l don't care. l miss my daughter. -Guess nobody's sleeping tonight. Hello, Rebecca. Hello. Oh, sweetie. -Hey, beauties and heroes. -Where have you been? l got something to show you. -This town's crying out for a cool café. -This town's crying out for an outlet mall. What? lt has possibilities. Where? Point out a possibility. Kitchen's basically okay, just needs a good cleaning. Look, wood floors. -ls that a termite? -No. Yeah, maybe. l think l got a name. The Home Café. What do you think? Well, it would be better for business than ''The Squalor and Desperation Café,'' l suppose. And the goddess said, ''Feed the people and send them out happy into the night.'' How's that mushroom lasagna holding up? -Two more orders left. -Save them for Martha and Gill. No problem. -You got them, my dears. -Thanks, Jonathan. We're home, dear. Oh, she's not happy today. For a full hour. l have no idea. Hey, honey. -Just feeling shitty? -l think she's getting sick. l gotta get dressed and get back to the restaurant. Yeah. And l have to, well, pick up some toys. -You okay? -Never better. l seem to have ended up the mother and the wife, haven't l? -That's not fair. -No, that's not fair. And l can't help that. l thought you'd be out here. l'm sorry. You haven't done anything. l just want everybody to be happy. -l know you do. -lt won't always be like this. We're still getting started. Bobby, what if l just couldn't do this? lt'll be okay. Trust me. You know, l think, maybe l'm not this unusual. l think maybe it's just my hair. -l love your hair. -Come here. -Oh, Bobby! -Oh, <i>mamaci</i>t<i>a</i>! Here you are. -Look what you've done! -Our little place. lt's beautiful! Oh, that's Ned and me! Where did you find this? Oh, it's lovely, all of it. -l wanna see the kitchen. -Come on. Oh, l love it! So here it is. Yasgur's Farm, the holy ground itself. lt's hard to believe all that went on here, isn't it? lt just looks like.. Mud puddle and a field of cowpies? l know. -Come on in, you people! -No. l have been in that water before. Bobby, don't you dare put her in there! Boys, give them a puddle to play in.. They're sweet together, aren't they? -ln their gooney way. -l think you're very brave. -You do? -Yeah. When l was your age, you got married and you had a family. Never occurred to you to do anything else. Well, you know, l wanted that. l wanted just a more normal thing when l was younger. Just wanted a husband and a baby and.. l think maybe you're better off. Really. One minute you have everything you ever wanted, and the next you find yourself in some suburban neighborhood somewhere. And it's fine. l mean, it's not not fine, it's just.. The world just starts to shrink around you somehow. Most women have absolutely no idea what they're getting into. No. l don't suppose anyone knows what they're getting into till they're into it. -For God's sake. -Hey, what's up? A little privacy, please. You never wanted privacy before. You okay? Yeah, l'm fine. What's that? lt's nothing. Come here. lt's one of those spots, l think. No, man, it's a bruise. Maybe. Absolutely. -Will you do something for me? -Sure. -Don't tell them. -l won't. l can't.. -lf l'm sick-- -You're not sick. Just promise me that, then, okay? -lf it's just a bruise-- -lt is a bruise. lf l just bumped my hip, there's no reason to mention it. -lt is a bruise. -Okay, there's no reason to talk about it. -Okay. -All right. -Mom, is that.? -Your father's ashes. l thought there'd be a right moment. Suddenly, if l don't give them to you right now l'll have to take them back to Phoenix with me. He wouldn't have wanted them scattered in Arizona. -l thought we could scatter them here. -Here? Well, this is your home, isn't it? l guess. You know, l think it might be best just to be done with it. He was a modest man. He wouldn't have wanted an elaborate ceremony. -Mom. -And l can tell you this this is no more him than a pair of his old shoes. Not yet. l'm-- Not here, not now. l'm not ready. Well, whenever you are. -We should go. -Okay. -Oh, l love you, honey. -l love you too. l'll see you at the café. Bye! l know. Did you get yourself dirty? Did you? You got yourself so dirty. l need powder. Did you get yourself dirty? l know you did. -You're so sexy like this. -You are a true pervert. Get me the powder. What happened? You got something on your face. Here, let me. You can do anything, can't you? -Me? No. -l mean it. You can live in the suburbs, in the East Village, in the country. lt doesn't make any difference to you, does it? l don't know. l never really think about it. There you go, all done. Come on. Thanks. Come here. Sit up there, princess. You are a strange and mysterious creature. l'm, like, the least mysterious one around here. l bet you could live in the Sahara. l bet you'd just pitch a tent and find someone to sell you a camel. l mean it. ls there anything you couldn't do? l couldn't be alone. Nope. No, you couldn't, could you? Hey, man. Blessings on our day off. l wonder if we should be closing on Mondays. -l feel a little guilty about it. -No worries, please. Hey, that little bruise gone away? Well, no. Let me see. -lt's the same. -Let me see. See? lt's the same. No, man, it's fading. -You really think so? -Absolutely. You wanna dance? -What? -Come on.

Mel. Melinda, open up, it's me! Hey, asshole, use the doorknocker! I love you. Melinda! Are you alright? Oh God, Danny, it's him. He followed us here. - I love you so much, baby. - There's someone else in there! Open this door! Melinda! Call the police. Asshole, try the doorknob! Let me in! Take your hands off her! You! What? Jesus, you're screwing your husband! - Your husband. - He followed me here and we. realized we deserve each other. Isn't that romantic, Dr. Klink? Roger, call me Roger, for Christ's sake. Maybe you should go home and working it out with your wife. Go to hell, Roger. Ex-wife, ex-home. Okay? I understand now that I was transgressing my love for Dan. unto you, and you were counter-transgressing! - Transferring! Bullshit! Any time a shrink is thinking about a patient. he should ask himself: ''Am I counter-transferring? ''. Shut up. You can't even get an erection. I just had one, buddy. Help! Help! He's bitting. Dr. Paige, thank God you are here. Three peas in a pot. Emily, they were fornicating like honeymooners. Dr. Paige, Melinda and I have worked through our problems. - Shut up, you! - Dr. Paige! It's alright, it's okay, it has a bad trigger. It's okay. Put the gun down, Dr. Paige. - Shoot them, Emily. - This is all your fault, Roger. Everything could've been so different. Sorry, it's touchy. Melinda, come back in here! Emily, I understand you're upset. you just have to let it out. Just try and let it out. Save your engaging devices, Roger. No more bullshit. No, I've come for all. Sorry, sorry. Over here! Over here! Over here! - Hurry, Dr. Paige has a gun. - Who is Dr. Paige? Our marriage counselor. She's gonna kill my husband and Dr. Klink. Your marriage counselor is gonna kill your husband? And Dr. Klink. Dr. Paige, I want to thank you for giving Melinda and I. the tools to help communicate and share our fears. - Shut up! - Emily, you're very upset. your feelings are spiraling out of control. Save your psycho-babble for your patients, Roger. Okay, you've some issues you need to work through. - No. Thank God. - Get out of the way. Mel, it's me, open up! - Somebody help me! - Don't worry, Danny! - What do we got, sir? - Hostage situation. Two therapists. Domestic or international? - Therapists, shrinks. - Shrinks? It's a joke, right? - Some kind of surprise party? - It's not a party, is very serious. A counselor is threatening to kill her husband and therapist. He's not technically my therapist. - You're the lady from those sex tapes. - Sex tapes? What sex tapes? His hands were under my dress. firmly holding onto my hips. Moving me back and forth away from him. Okay, maybe I better start from the beginning. About 2 years ago Danny lost his erection. You gotta see these tapes. Pretty soon, Danny and me weren't even talking and then, Danny slept with that waitress. - Thought he couldn't get an erection? So did I. Our marriage was doomed. Then, I saw Dr. Paige's add on a bus bench. ''Save your marriage today, tomorrow will be too late''. Her big deal is honesty. Honesty first. The key is honesty. Marriage is hard, I know, I've been married three times. - You're divorced? - Three times. - I speak from experience. - Is that a marriage counselor? - Dan! - Dan, what? We're taking advice from somebody that's been divorced. and advertises on bus benches. Stay with us, Dan. You know the story about the guy who goes to the barbershop? There are two barbers, both available. One barber has a terrific haircut. the other barber's hair looks just awful. Which barber would you go to? You go to the barber with the bad haircut. Not the barber with the good haircut, see? The bad haircut cuts the other one's hair and vice versa. That is why it is actually a plus that I'm thrice divorced. Okay. Let's start over. - What do you want out of this therapy? - We. I want to save your marriage. - Yeah, me too, yeah. - Right. Talking about our problems is the first step. You can tell me anything. And hopefully you two can learn to communicate honestly. What's the problem? Well. Danny and me. we haven't been. familiar with each other in a while. - Familiar? - Intimate. - No sexual intercourse? - Jesus, lady. What about oral sex or mutual masturbation? Let's go, we don't need to see some shrink. No, I think we do, Dan. - He has a problem with. - Don't! Come on, why? ''Mr. Happy''. - ''Mr. Happy''? - His penis. You said it. I can't get my penis to stand up. I'm impotent or something. I can't wake the baby. I. I can't get a hard on. Is everybody happy now? We can go? - Dan is impotent. - Only with me. - That was an accident. - He accidentally screwed that waitress. - I thought he couldn't get an erection. - So did I. - She's been so depressed. It's pretty depressing when you can't excite your own husband. Great, we've made some real progress. All those who are in favor raise your hands. Dr. Paige, you may rejoin the group. Dr. Paige, it is the duty of this committee. to defend the integrity of the Psychiatric arts. in the Boise area. Dr. Paige. if we allow bus-bench advertising, what's next? Billboards? Cable TV? Following our laws pertaining to advertising. the fine is set in US$ 250. Roger! Hello, Emily. Sorry about the fine. It's only 250 bucks. I'll write it off. Besides, I already got some clients from the bus bench. I was thinking about you the other day. - Me? Really? - Are you seeing anyone new? - I'm still married. - I meant patients. There's a woman I'd like you to see. She's very depressed. Her depression is at the root of her sexual problems with her husband. - You could really help her. - I'm not really adding patients. You talked about how great it'd be to collaborate. The couple is perfect. Marriage is on the rocks. I'll take the boy. you'll take the girl, we can confer and strategize. And together help them save their marriage. How is your wife? Okay. And your husband? The new one? He's my new ex. I moved out last weekend. Really? Just like that? Just like that. It's for the best. So, what do you say? There's nothing else to say. Dan's gone off me. This is a waste of time. Okay, I feel like we're stuck. Melinda, I want you to see a colleague. - Are you giving up on me? - I want you to see Dr. Klink. he's a depression expert. - From the old school. - What's a depression expert? What a cliché! First the affair in Denver, then the red Corvette. What's next? Face lifts and liposuction? Desire fades. Who is she? Is it your new receptionist? You think I need a liposuction? You're not rehashing Denver, are you? Are you? - Are you screwing Dr. Rice again? - No, there's no one. We are not happy. Go to hell, Roger. Asshole. The door, please. Unsafe at any speed. - The elevator? - No, your Corvette. Unsafe at any speed. That's a Corvair. Unsafe at any speed. It looks just like a Corvette. - Funky elevator. - I try not to speak, I got stuck once. - By yourself? - Yeah. How boring. Is that why you carry a change of clothes? Oh, this? No. I left my wife, just now, this morning. You're kidding. - Is this your floor? - Yes. I'm here to see Dr. Klick. He's an old fashion depression expert. You mean Dr. Klink? - Yes. - I'm Dr. Klink. You are Dr. Klink? You're kidding? I pictured a bald-head, long-face pointy beard. Who called me old fashioned? Doctor Paige. You mean Emily? Well. Anyway, I'll see you inside. Inside and out, I suppose. Inside. In my office. This is my door. Patients go in that door down there. Wait. Your tie is crooked. I guess your wife didn't check you before you left the house. Just. go right in. Tuesday. Goddamn it. Dr. Klink? Your 9:45 is here. Test: one, two, one two. Test: one, two, three. Shit. Sorry. - It's very cold in here. - Really? - You'll need to remember a sweater. - No, no, I meant the decor. It's so blue. Alrighty. Mrs. Carmichael, would you like to sit here? - Is that where you want me to sit? - I don't want you to sit. anywhere. I see. What happened to that friendly man I met on the elevator? Look, we had an inappropriate introduction, but. - Is that what we had? - Yes. Please. So? - Why are you here? - I'm trying to save my marriage. I've been so depressed lately, I think it'll pass, but it doesn't. You're a little hanged up one morning. then suddenly you're on a shrink's lab. Chair. Well, you don't seem very depressed right this moment. I'm not. I was. I almost didn't get off the elevator. It's pretty depressing to think you need to see a depression expert. My marriage expert's been divorced three times. - You must be really depressed. - Let's. Why don't you.? Tell me more about you. I'm married to a man who doesn't get turned on by me. - Do you blame me? - Why would I blame you? Not me, him. I asked if you blamed your husband. - No, you said ''me''. - Well, I meant your husband, of course. - Of course. Dan started sleeping in the living room on the couch. that's the beginning of the end, don't you think? It certainly suggests a lack of intimacy. We stopped being intimate almost two years ago. - I shouldn't tell you this. - No. - Dr. Klink. - No, no, please, sit. I. You can tell me anything. Really. Continue. One night, I get up to use the bathroom. and I looked in on Dan. He sleeps in his boxers, and it was a hot night. the covers were off, so I could see his ''Mr. Happy''. - ''Mr. Happy''? - His thingy. - His pe. member. - Peeking out. So I decided to try a little experiment to see if Dan was broken or if he'd just gone off me. An experiment? I snuck up on my knees. and with my mouth I. kissed ''Mr. Happy''. But when I tried to make love, he. his. It fizzled away when he woke up and realized it was me. - Dan's gone off me. - Desire fades. That. that is a depressing thought. Yes. It. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm in a transitional phase in my life. I'm not taking on any more patients. - But you've helped me already. - Really, I can't. If there are two shrinks in a small town. and one was crazy and the other sane which one would you go to see? - I've never heard this. - You'd go to the crazy one. 'cause if there were only two in the town. you'd wanna see the one who'd helped the other one. You mean, there if there were just two.? I see. - Dr. Klink, your 10:30 is here. - Do you hear that? I mean, I would love. to just sit here and talk with you. all afternoon. but if I run even 5 minutes over on one session. my whole week could be thrown off. Hell, the rest of my life. I'd gladly recommend to you someone else. This is a list of qualified mental health professional's in Boise. Melinda! Dr. Klink, what are you doing? - I'm chasing after you. - What about your 10:30? No, I just. I've left my wife. and, since you are not my patient and since this. this isn't my office. It's stuck again. - Dr. Klink. - Yeah. Roger. This is so therapeutic. No, you should not call me Dr. Klink. We could give the wrong impression. But I feel so free and open. I wish Dan had come with me maybe he could benefit from your expertise. - I don't feel depressed at all! - Don't talk. Are you folks okay? You seem out of breath. - See you next week, Dr. Klink. - Roger. I'm not actually her doctor, it's. a figure of speech. He is a genius. His method is so subtle. It sneaked right up on me. - What did he do exactly? - He got me to talk. - Sort of. - How many sessions have you had? Just one. What a man. He is a genius. Hey, what about my needs? Am I part of this therapy stuff or what? Alright. - ''Mastering Masturbation''? - It's a wonderful guide. Techniques, fantasy games, lubricants, all in historical context. Did you know that Edison was an avid masturbator? It's where he got his best ideas. Edison stole his best ideas. Whatever, maybe it was Einstein. You look fabulous. Possible disrotation subject. Orgasms and happiness. Why is it all the world seems rosy? It's Dr. Paige, regarding Melinda. - I'll call her back. - She's on her way in. Son of a bitch, I cannot believe what you did with Melinda. - She told you? - Told me? It's all over her face. I never took any money. And all I did was a preliminary interview. It's absolutely wonderful. - Really? - The big challenge is to get. these people to reconnect emotionally and sexually. - Can I buy you lunch? - Today? I'm seeing Mrs. Carmichael. During lunch time? - Oh, Dr. Klink. - Roger, Roger. Call me Roger. Oh, Dr. Klink. Look, a helicopter. Maybe it was a transplant. What? The helicopter. was carrying a little ice chest. with a red cross on it. Imagine waking up with a whole new heart, Dr. Klink. Please, call me Roger. Oh, Danny and me used to have so much in common. Everything we did together was making love. Not just sex but cooking together. and we took a trip to Salt Lake City. And he was like my big brother and my friend and my lover, all. - We have to talk. I just. I've got patients all afternoon. I'm just trying to tell you that I felt so good. since last week session that I told Danny about us. - What? - Yes. You told your husband about us? Oh, my God! It was amazing, spontaneous, like we used to be. - What did I do to deserve this? - You screwed that cocktail waitress. But it wasn't spontaneous, or amazing. You shouldn't have told him. - You talked about honesty. - No. Dr. Paige talks about honesty. I'm still on the fence, some lying is good. You didn't give details. Wow, elevator sex. Damn, I've always admired Melinda's spunk. - Larry. - Now you're even, bro. - How did he take it? - He followed me here. He what? Very nice, he's what? Look! Melinda, I. It's over. You and me. Dan needs you, he loves you. He followed you here. Isn't that romantic? Listen. take what you've gotten out of our time together focus it back on Dan. Are you saying that as my lover or my therapist? Therapist. I mean, if I was your therapist, which I'm not. We have nothing in common. This isn't a relationship. based on mutual respect or understanding. it's based on sex, that's all. Take it. My God, we come from different worlds. I've got a Ph.D., you'd barely graduated from high school. I have an AA from Boise Community College. and a certificate on physical therapy. Exactly. The two of you are more suited. You're perfect. Go home to. What's his.? Dan! Divorced? But you two were doing much better. I wish you'd never sent me to see Dr. Klink. - Therapy can be very intense. - Especially oral therapy. - Dan, don't be crass. - Crass? - You had to have sex in an elevator. - What? Who did? Dr. Klink and me. You slept with Dr. Klink in an elevator? Like a couple of dogs in heat they slept. You're disgusting. I didn't have to bend over backwards to get him aroused. I thought that's what you did do. Bastard, I wanted this to work out. - Was the elevator your idea or his? - Does it matter? You son of a bitch. In the elevator. In the elevator. Emily, it just happened. She wasn't technically my patient. Save it for the board! - You didn't tell the board? - Of course I told the board. This is outrageous. - Kindly keep your voice down. - The amount is regulated by. the bar laws. Specifically, number 47 calls. for fines of up to US$25 for inappropriate behavior. Inappropriate behavior? He was having sex with his patient in an elevator. She wasn't technically his patient. The minute she walks into his office she was his patient. No, technically she was your patient. - My patient? - I think the fine is fair. I was fined 250 bucks for advertising on a bus bench. he's fined 25 dollars for screwing in an elevator. Law 17 is very specific to permissible outdoor advertising. A hooker costs more than that. - Dr. Paige, that's enough. - It's more than enough. Who should I make the check out to? All you had to do is call me, why didn't you? - I'm sorry, Emily. - You will be. I really am sorry, Emily. This is over. You're not off the hook, you will lose everything. money, your license, by the time this is over. you will never practice again. - What are you gonna do? - NOSTA. NOSTA? - What the heck is a NOSTA? - N-O-S-T-A. The National Organization to Stop Therapist Abuse. National? I don't know. I really just want Danny back. We need to teach him a lesson. - Danny? - Hi, Mel. Okay, let me do all the talking. What law school you said you went to? Careful, you sent my vulnerable sister-in-law into the arms of that Dr. Krink. - It's Klink, Larry, and shut up. You should've talked to me before you called them. We're gonna nail that son of a bitch. There she is. Consuelo N. Barker Barker & Barker. who represent NOSTA. I'm the second Barker; Connie. - You must be the victim. - Lawrence P. Carmichael, ABD. I'll be handling all negotiations. Let me remind you, you're the first group we've contacted. so we're looking for a competitive figure which. will act as a detour to other groups we may be inclined to go. to. ABD? - All But Degree. My client. - Take a powder, Lawrence. this is a serious situation. You're way out of your league. - Take your pet monkey with you. - Just a second. That's my husband. I need to speak to you privately. It's precisely this cases that we must win. We need to send out a message, a strong message. We'll prove that he took advantage of your fragile ego. and lured you into ''psycho sexual emotional bondage''. - Psycho what? - He's a master manipulator. - It's that quiet lost puppy quality. - I felt an attraction for Dr. Klink. Transference. There's strong feelings that the patient, you. erroneously transfers to a therapist, Dr. Klink. but which in fact originated out of earlier relationships. Like with my husband, maybe. Perhaps an even earlier relationship. Where did this immoral congress transpired? - Immoral congress? - In an elevator. - Elevator sex? - And in his office. - And on his couch. - And on the desk. Why did you go to Dr. Klink? She sent me to him, said he'd take care of me in the old fashioned way. He's a specialist, a depression expert. We met at a communication conference. - We'll get it all in a deposition. - My deposition? You're a key witness. Okay, let's skip the elevator for now. - Take me through this couch copula. - Well, it's a little embarrassing. We started on the desk. Have you ever heard the name Ezri Stovall? He's the malpractice insurance go to guy in this region. He rarely loses, he never settles. He will be ruthless. Now I know this is difficult but it's important that you recall. the exact details and specific sequence of events. Well, it's a little hazy. But I know he. Dr. Klink went down on me. Cunnilingus? - Are you okay? - What else did he do? - I went down on him. - Fellatio? We don't wanna play this oral sex card. It's illegal in this state. - It is? - It's sodomy. Oral sex is sodomy? To carnally know any male or female person by the anus or mouth. - It's a misdemeanor. - I don't wanna hurt Dr. Klink. I just wanted to save my marriage. Dr. Klink made me realize how much Danny and me have in common. We'll crush Dr. Klink. Look at you. My God, just look at you. Dr. Paige is right. You're a poor pathetic woman. He's destroyed you. Nice shot. - Mind if I sit? - It's a free bar. That lawyer thinks a divorce would be great for our case. I don't want to divorce, Mel. - No? - No. I just want you to stop seeing him. I'm not seeing him. So, you don't want to split up? No! Not at all, we can't split up. You and I. we are like a team. Sigfrid and Roy, Hall and Oates. ham and cheese. I'm sorry I strayed, but you kind of opened the door. - I wanted to talk. The truth. - Let's not talk about it. Water down the drain, Dan. Water down the drain. How's that divorce coming? Please, counsel, let's not lose sight of the human element. A divorce would really help our case. I'm on it. Joel Johnson Jr. He's with Beerquist, Angsthall & Cox. Joel is our point man here in. - Boise. - Boise. Joel's come up with a figure. How much money were you hoping to see? US$30 thousand? Million. It's US$30 million. - US$30 million? - US$30 million? You've hit the jackpot, Melinda. - Dr. Klink doesn't have US$ 30 million. - He has a malpractice insurance and they've got U$30 million. - God! I had no idea it would be so much. There's not a better person she could've screwed. Except a priest. Catholics would pay a lot of money to keep this crap down. I'm gonna get 30 million dollars for having sex with him? - In an elevator. - And on his desk. - US$30 million. - Minus 30% contingency. 50% if we went on appeal. How much more do you think a divorce might add? Why the hell are you suing me? Because. you took advantage of my fragile ego. and got me in a psycho emotional sexual thing. - What? - Take a walk, or I'll call the cops. If it isn't the erection wonder ''Mr. Happy''. - You told him about ''Mr. Happy''? - I told you that in therapy. First of all: it's Roger. Secondly: it wasn't therapy, you were never my patient. Tell that to the judge, ''Mr. Majestic''. - You told him about ''Mr. Majestic''? - He's my husband, I tell him everything. - Are you screwing yet? - There's more than sex. There better be with Mr. Limpy here. - Son of a bitch! - Danny! Come on. I hope you fight better. Let go. Come on, Klink, come on. - Why'd you tell him about Mr. Happy? - It's okay, he's a doctor. Don't sue me, Melinda. I'll lose my license, it's all I have. I'm sorry. Good-bye, Dr. Klink. Roger, call me Roger. Ezri Stovall will crush her like a bug. We've got to stop this kind of frivolous litigation. People have to start taking responsibility for their actions. Why'd you stop sleeping together? Makes it seem like you were doing something wrong. Is a taboo, a therapist can never have sex with a patient. The moment you two screwed. she became your lover, thereby, making it impossible. for her to ever be your patient. - Where did you bone her? - We made love in an elevator. Elevator sex? You're kidding me. - I'm in elevators all the time. - I know, I'm sorry. - How long would that take? - It was over pretty quick. - Mechanical failure? - No, she hit the stop. Or maybe I did. Is this really important? Every detail is important. Do you need booze? Juries are fickle. Something could come out of the trial and you'd be screwed. Any witnesses? - Other passengers? - Of course not. - How about a surveillance camera? - Oh, Jesus. There may not be one if the building is old. - Please, God. - Okay. So, you boned her. Did you ejaculate? - Is there anyway not to? - Not that I've found. Did she mention any other therapists she'd slept with? Other members of the Hippocratic arts? Orthodontists, podiatrists, clergy? - I don't know. I don't think so. - What about you? How many other non-patient patients have you banged? - None. - Your receptionist? Tiffany? No! Well, let Ezri Stovall get to work. Clammy. Don't answer, baby. - Helen, Ezri. - Hi, what's up? I've got something for you. Are you free? Available, never free. Never give it away, baby. Is that son of a bitch Stovall? She's spoken for! This is business. I'm defending a head-shrinker who put his pecker where he shouldn't have. - And she's suing him. - Bingo. - Don't get it, baby. - Hold on. - You haven't worked in a month. - I can't, I'm gonna. - Is Felix Potter in? - He sure is. Goddamn! Felix Potter? Connie Barker of Chicago, Joel Johnson gave me your number. I'm looking for a private investigator. I'm representing a victim in a therapist abuse case. What do you want? I need you to find out if there's anything bad in his past. We're just starting depositions. - What's the matter? - What's the matter? - Nothing, radio. - Nothing, TV. - His name's Roger Klink. - Melinda Carmichael. - Roger Klink. - Dr. Klink? - What's her name? - Melinda Carmichael. You'll get your usual fee. Felix, I need some dirt on Dr. Klink. Fax me everything you've got, Ezri. I gotta go. Bye. Interested. 50 bucks an hour plus expenses. Fax me at this number. Fax. We're working in the same job again. You show me yours, I'll show you mine. Have you ever had your deposition taken before? Do you understand, that your testimony here today. is giving under oath just like in court? So, despite the informal setting. you're testifying under penalty of perjury. I'm sorry, the tape jammed. I need a minute. It's his first day. Is he gonna be here everyday? That's right. Got it. Now, Mrs. Carmichael. were you carnally intimate with Roger Klink? - Carnally intimate? - Sexually intimate. I guess so. I mean. we had sex. Would you please describe in specific detail. the first of these decorous unions with Roger Klink? Indecorous unions. Consenting adults engaging fornication. What could be more decorous, counselor? How about if for the purposes of this deposition. we let the noun stand alone, unqualified? ''Union'', plane and simple. Fine. Mrs. Carmichael, would you please walk me through this initial union? - What? Describe your first encounter with Dr. Klink. Roger. Klink. - He is a doctor, counsel. - Yes, counsel. But not her doctor. How about if for the purposes of this deposition. we let the Klink stand alone, unqualified? Fine. Mrs. Carmichael, when you are ready. Well, we had. sex in the elevator of his building, between floors. And would you describe this union as standard? - Where are you getting at? - I'm trying to establish. the mode by which they currently express themselves. The way in which they were currently expressive? Precisely. Missionary, front door, back door, roundly-round? Were you prostrated? Plumbed? Any other? Well, he stopped the elevator. and we just kind of moved at each other. Did he stop the elevator, or did you? One of us did, it's a little hazy. Okay, but you made the first move. You're leading the plaintive, counsel. We both moved at the same time. Grabbed at each other. He was very excited. Klink told you he was excited? No, but I could feel his. well, his. ''Mr. Happy'' was pressing up against me. ''Mr. Happy''? That's what my husband calls his. - Johnson. - Yes, counsel. Not you. I'm referring to Melinda's husband's Johnson. Klink's Johnson. Klink's penis. Could we stay focused on Klink's penis and not the husband's. Mrs. Carmichael. perhaps there's another term we could use to describe. Roger Klink's penis. ''Mr. Majestic'', that's what he calls it. Why didn't you tell me your pecker has a name? And that she knows it. I didn't think it'd come up. I had an affair three years ago. I mean, with a doctor in Denver. If I hadn't have that affair I would've never bought the Corvette or left my wife. - Are you still seeing him? - Him? It was a her. She-doctor. - Alright. It doesn't have any bearing on this case. It better not. Back on the record, please. Okay, so you could feel ''Dr. Majestic''. I think it's ''Mr. Majestic'', counsel. Right. You could feel ''Mr. Majestic'' pressing up against you. What happened next? We started kissing and grabbing. and he was bumping himself up against me. kissing my neck and. he slid his hands under my blouse. and was caressing my breast in circles. Tiny little circles. And one thing led to another. and I just. took ''Mr. Majestic''. in my mouth. You son of a bitch! - Dr. Paige! - Danny! - Stop it. - You son of a bitch! How dare you? How dare you? Are you okay? I'm alright. I'm alright. Out, out! I'm sorry. Stop it! lmmature peckerwoods! Oh, hilarity! She kissed his pipi. Grow up! This is serious goddamned business! Seditious, yes. Scandalous, of course. Titillating, possibly. but my client's career hangs on. Miss Barker's client's most intimate testimonial. Get out and stay out until it's time of your depositions! Mine? Why would I need to do one? You're the flaccid bastard that started this whole mess. - Now beat it! - He is. - Ditto! Or I'll scream! - I'm going. Beautifully expressed, counsel. - That shit's hot. - Shut up, Larry! You're not looking at the big picture. The three, zero, zero zero, zero, zero zero, zero dollar. Enough! Give it a rest, Larry, okay? This is all your fault! My fault? You're the one that sent my wife to that sex feaster. - I'll catch you later, bro. I. I forgot something. If you'd been able to deliver the goods she wouldn't be so damn horny that she threw herself to him. - Fuck you, Dr. Paige. - Fuck me? How are you gonna do that, with Dr. Klink's help? No. We came to you because we wanted to save our marriage. You're professionals and you don't know anything. You wanna know why you can't get an erection with Melinda? - Why? - No protection, no erection. No diaphragm, ''Mr. Happy'' gets sad. Wife wants children, husband doesn't. Wife forces the issue. It is a classic Venus and Mars dynamic. Generally, we like patients to come to certain conclusion on their own. But what the hell, there it is, free of charge. - I'm not ready to be a father. - And what does Melinda say? We don't ever talk about it, what is there to say? Isn't that what marriage is? Knowing without saying? That's fantasyland, Dan. All relationships are killed by dishonesty. repressed feelings, things left unsaid. Honesty first. No protection, no erection. You are good. I'm the best. No protection, no erection. Back on the record, please. I'm trying to picture this. You were kneeling? No, I was standing up bend over. with him in my mouth. So, he was a passive participant. No, his hand was under my skirt. and he started to touch me, rub my. ''Mrs. Happy''? Yes, and let's see. with his other hand he was still touching my breast. very gently. slowly tracing tiny circles around my nipple. Around and around. Around and around. And up and down on ''Mrs. Happy''. Up and down. And around, and around. Off the record a second. Counsel, excuse me. Would you object to attend a recess? Quite the contrary, counsel. I'm just trying to tell the truth. It sounds like you've had wonderful sex with a terrific lover. We're trying to sue him, remember? We're not writing an erotic novel. Circles, though, sound great. How did you come up with that circle business? - Circle business? - Around the nipple. Around and around. up and down. Around and around, and up and down. Excuse me. Nice camera work. - Here. - I thought they kicked you out. - Lawrence Carmichael. - Esquire. Attorney. - You're a lawyer? - ABD. How would you kids like to earn. a little extra scratch on the side? Scratch? Time sort of stood still. I remember becoming aware of pounding and people's voices. Then, the phone started to ring. That's when he. put his. ''Mr. Majestic''. into my. ''Mrs. Happy''. .and there was this pounding and shouting. and ringing and we got into this amazing rhythm. and it was all over in about a minute. Minute and a half. - Did Klink arrive at a mission? - Yes. I wasn't using any protection. so at the last minute we pulled apart and I finished him with my hand. - You did? - Yes. And the other time too. Really? Off the record, for a second. Is it hot in here, counsel? It's almost eleven. I'd like to break early for lunch. This is the first day. Given the exhaustive nature of today's testimony perhaps a discontinuation. - Is counsel requesting a recess? What would counsel's inclination be to that request? Request granted. Does counsel have plans for lunch? Counsel's going back to the hotel for a cold shower. Howdy, Ezri. - Howdy, partner. - How are you? You've got a great memory for details. It's like being there, everything comes floating out. Melinda, why are you suing me? This is so humiliating for both of us and if it goes to trial. everyone in Boise will find out about it. I think I'm gonna drop the sue, I don't wanna go any further with it. What? Really? No. You should get. something. Do you love me, Dr. Klink? Do I love you? Yes, do you love me? I could love you. Good. - Thanks, Ezri, - Get that looked at. What is it with you and elevators? - Take the goddamned stairs. - I wanted to talk to you. Maybe. I was thinking. I really want to settle out of court. Let me set you straight. First: Ezri Stovall has never settled. - But. - He either wins. or goes down kicking and biting. Two, two. Ezri Stovall makes the recommendation to the insurance. company to go to court, to settle, etceteras. If you don't hear his advice. you'll be settling on your own without the insurance company. I have malpractice insurance. Fine print, elevator boy. your policy guarantees you a defense. it doesn't say it'll pay out if you lose. or if it finds that you have acted criminally. - Criminally? - Or either unethically. - She wasn't even my patient. - Or, if you decide to, and I quote. ''lf you decide to act against insurance appointed counsel''. You mean if I settle I pay? Yep. Hey, Mel. I got you some Arby's. Thanks. I've been thinking, Mel, I know what our problem was. Me too. You cheated with that waitress. I didn't. I was gonna, but I didn't. You lied to me about sleeping with her? - You and I weren't. - You couldn't. I couldn't because you wanted a baby. Dr. Paige spelled it out for me. No protection, no erection. I wasn't ready yet. But if you want a baby, we'll have one. Especially with the money we're getting. I don't want to make a baby. Not yet. - Yeah, you do. - I don't. Dr. Paige said it was classic. the way you lost your diaphragm. She's wrong. I didn't use it, because you wanted me pregnant. I wanted you pregnant? No, you. Wait, you wanted to get pregnant. No way, I'm not ready to have a baby. You're not? That means we're both not ready. Do you understand? This is awesome. I thought that if I mentioned it, you'd divorce me. Really? Me, too. My God. Honesty first. I feel like a wimp. Dr. Paige is a genius. - I love you, Mel. - I love you, Danny. I've missed you holding me, my hand and touching my back. - This is what I wanted. - Me, too. We could do this everyday, all day, whenever we want. With that money, we could do whatever we want. You should the things Larry has lined up. The telemarketing, the opportunities. real-state, there's fun stuff, too. - Jai-Alay, boxing. - What's Larry have to do? He works for us. He quit his job. - Larry's never had a job. - He has one now. he works for us. He's gonna get 10% . This isn't a jackpot, Dan. This is our life. I was stupid before. Say whatever you have to say. I don't even care. Where are you going? I want out. I want all to go away the doctors, the lawyers and you. - Me? What did I do? I don't like you, Danny, you're a big bad devil. What? What did I do? - You wanna drop the lawsuit? - Yes, it's not worth it. - I never liked this to begin with. - This one looked better on paper. Fine. Fine, just write us a check for all of our legal fees. Fine, how much would that be? Let's see. We have Miss Barker's fees. Plus expenses times ten days. Plus first class air fare. And her support staff in Chicago. There's me and my staff here in Boise. Plus one private detective at 50 dollars an hour. Plus Xeroxing, postage, various office expenses. comes just under US$75 thousand. - US$ 75 thousand? - Just under. I don't have that kind of money. I guess we'll stay in the course. Never forget you're the victim here. Tiff.? Who are you? Where's Tiffany? Helen Dallwore Private Investigator. Your receptionist let me in. I don't know who you work for. I work for you, asshole. Ezri Stovall hired me. - Is Dr. Rice in this picture? - Come again? That's what she said. Ezri said you banged some shrink at a conference. Dr. Rice. Are you still in contact with her? No, Dr. Rice is no longer in the picture. Could you please not touch mine or Tiffany's things? Did Mrs. Carmichael mention any other affairs? Other doctors she screwed: dentists, podiatrists, clergy? Clergy? No. I told Mr. Stovall everything. and anything she told me is confidential. Right, don't wanna abuse that doctor-patient relationship. I must insist that you leave. Don't get lippy with me, Doc, I didn't screw my patient. She'll. In an elevator? Are you kidding me? We aren't talking about Roger, right? Good all ''Mr. By the Book''. When I met him, he was a 23 year old virgin. and the morning after we had sex for the first time. I got a call out of the blue from an ex-boyfriend who proposes to me. - Well? - Roger, in a fit of jealousy. jumps up and says: ''I will marry you''. Years later, I found out what he meant: ''Could''. Not want. So, you got married on a grammatical error? All I know is. we were never very happy. Has he had many affairs, your husband? Well, there was that OTOPI conference in Denver a couple of years ago. OTOPI? That's analogous, right? - What? - OTOPI. The Organization of Therapists Analysts, bla-bla-bla. - Right. - I shouldn't be telling you this. - I've had too many of these. - Darling. you can tell me anything. Well, he comes back from Denver and he's a changed man. All of a sudden he is ''Mr. Oral Sex''. Up until then Roger had very rarely. ''cunnilingued'' me. You say: ''cunnilingued''? Well, I don't know what's the verb for cunnilingus. - ''Cunnilingueated''? - Stop it. ''Cunnilingual''? That verb? I don't know, but I like it. He comes back from Denver and suddenly he's an expert. Oh, yes. He's slow, he's sensual. he's circular. Am I boring you? Not a bit. Salty. And he started doing this circle thing, you know. with his hands on my breast. - Like that. - Really? I let. the whole thing drop. And then. five or six months later he got a card in the mail from a Dr. Rice. - Looked like an invitation. - Who is Dr. Rice? Exactly what I said. You know, very nicely. And Roger got very flustered. And said something about been addressed to the wrong Dr. Klink. Dr. Rice is a boy doctor or a girl doctor? A girl doctor. Are you sure? Who else but a girl could've taught him all those things? Thank you for your help. We are separated, you know? - Do you live alone? - I have a room mate. But listen, here's my card. and if you think of anything else, why don't you call me? - Day or night. - Thank you. Ma'am. I'll see you. What's going on? - Good morning, counsel. - Hi, counsel. How's it hanging? You better put that animal in a cage or I'll have to get a restraining order. Your client is violating rules regarding behavior. I'll squeeze in with you. Let's take the stairs. I get an erection just thinking about elevators. We were by the door, standing up, he was hugging me. moving his hands over my dress and then under my dress. I wasn't wearing any underwear. Baby! Hey, Dan, over here. - Larry. You've seen Melinda? - Haven't seen her, bro. You think this money is going to her head, do you? I don't think so. In fact, I don't think she's a 100% into the whole thing. We were talking last. This is.? Larry, this is Melinda naked. I took her head off last year's Christmas card. downloaded the body off the net, the rest is the magic of PhotoShop. - But, goddamn, Larry, she's still naked. - It's not her body. With sexy artwork on the video box I can get double per unit. What are you talking about? I put my hands in his pants. - Oh, my God, Larry. - That's my little surprise. - Melinda is hot, bro. - Are those.? Would you look at this crowd? We can sell deposition tapes to every bar in town. I've got a buddy working on the web site. Larry, I'm trying to get back with her. - Have you seen your brother? - Speaking of the devil. Hey, Melinda! - What's this? - Don't worry. It's not your body. Turn it off, I think the game is on. With his other hand he was very. That's me on TV. .around and around and around. And up and down on. ''Mrs. Happy''! Turn it off! Turn it off! Danny? Oh, Mel. - Oh, shit. - How could you? - I didn't, I swear. - How could you? I didn't, Mel, I swear. I swear to God I didn't, Mel. That's my wife! Could we please turn it off? Hey, everybody, it's ''Mr. Happy''! Hey, Buddy. Get down! Let me go! You're kidding. That's not so bad. When? Good idea. Time is the essence. Get hold of Dr. Paige in the morning. No, I'll convey the message to Mr. Stovall. - What's up? - Good news for our team. The Carmichaels are splitting up for good. Melinda's at some motel by the highway. She is very upset. I'd like to give her a day's rest. Johnson thinks we should move on to Paige's deposition. I'm not sure I'm prepared for Dr. Paige. Ezri, it would mean an awful lot to me. Max, do you ever think about the other rube? The one you didn't want? The one you stood up? You were afraid to walk down, afraid to let down your hair and run. I'm not looking for an answer just a little. anonymous companionship. Here, Doc, compliments of the ladies at the end of the bar. It's the Corvette, Max, the women love it. To ''Dr. Majestic''. - ''Dr. Majestic''. - Who told you that? That's confidential. Doc. Attorney. Doc, you forgot your picture. - Is Felix in? - He's in the shower. Oh, you are the room mate. He said he had a room mate. - Did he? And you must be? - I'm Jennifer. - I'm the almost ex Mrs. Dr. Klink. - Right. - And you're here because.? - Well. I have a very valuable piece of evidence to help screw. my future ex-husband. And. I'd really like to give it to Felix. We're not just room mates, we're partners. Okay, so what happened is I got a call from Max. the bartender down at the lounge. He didn't know Roger and I split, so he called the house, and. Iook what my husband left behind in the bar. I've seen this picture before. What's the big deal? That's Dr. Rice next to my husband. Ex-husband! - Look at their hands. - That's Dr. Rice? ''To a great orator, love, E.R.''. Dr. Rice taught Roger. the ''cunnilingual'' arts, as Felix put it. Is that how he put it? Does Felix take long showers? We are lovers, not just partners. Yes, okay. Well, I never would have. Look at me. A lot of fringe. Well. He called you his room mate, just so you know that. - Sorry. - That's okay, that's okay. This is an Idaho Chardonnay if you wanna. I'm gonna go, keep the photo. Keep this. And bust his balls for me, would you? - Don't worry. - This better be good. - I've found a picture of Klink with Dr. Rice. - Meaningless. Good-bye. Guess who Dr. Rice is. Really? - Are you sure? - Positive. I'll call you back. Consuelo, that was amazing. That was a classy misdemeanor. My dear, that was a felony. You know what I hate? I hate that one of us has to lose. I wish we could both win. Exhibit A is a group photograph from the OTOPI shrink convention. Denver 1999. Do you recognize the woman standing next to Roger Klink? Of course I do. Would you please read what's written on the back on the photo? ''To a great orator, love, E.R.''. - Who is E.R.? - Emily Rice. - Who is Emily Rice? - Me. I am. I was. My second former husband was Eugene Rice. What did you mean ''a great orator''? It's double on tongue. No big deal. It refers to oral sex. We had a fling in Denver. We hardly left the room for 3 days although it was more of a workshop. considering Roger was a sexual flaggingly. I object. It's the truth. I tutored him in various sexual techniques. granted, he was a quick learner. he made the greatest thrives in the oral disciplines. - Hence, a great ''orator''. - Oral? You and Dr. Klink? I named his penis ''Mr. Majestic''. - To boost his confidence. - Jesus. - Oh, God. - Oh, man. - Should I go off record? - Don't you dare. I showed him everything. I crammed 6 months of training into 3 days. And we had an elevator in Denver. - You two had sex in an elevator? - Well. Well, he was too timid. ''What if someone comes? I'm so scared''. You were like a super-charged sex instructor. ''Roll over, rub here, touch this, on your back, on your knees.'' - It was like a sexual boot camp. - You loved it. And then you have the nerve to share my advance circle technique. with her. Those circles are mine, I gave him that technique. But that's all it is to you: technique. And disciplines, maneuvers. I mean, if you'd shut up once during the weekend and let me be me. I might never gone back to my wife. - You should've told me, Dr. Paige. - It had no bearing. You pressed me to sue him. You wanted to nail the bastard. You used me to get back at Dr. Klink. - How could you? You, you stole those circles from Dr. Paige. Hell hath no fury like a woman scormed. - No, no, I was trying to help. - You used Mrs. Carmichael. - A broken woman. - Who was unable. to defend herself from the advances of this sexual predator. Predator? He's a leaf eater, a sexual herbivore. - I object. - A predator created by Dr. Paige. - But then her creation spurned her. - So you set out to destroy him. and this innocent woman just got in your way. - None of this is true. - You've ruined my life, Dr. Paige. My marriage is over. Dan's become a greedy asshole and his shit brother. is selling my deposition to local bars. What? - I did it. - Well, you're fired. You can't fire her, she's pregnant. The tapes are meaningless now. Remember your wish last night, Consuelo? - Last night? - That both of us could win this case. That is impossible, but I've come up with the next best thing. First: you drop your sue against Klink. - Do what? - Drop the sue? Never. We'll file a sue on behalf of Carmichael and Klink. the real victims in this case. against the real villain. the knaving and vengeful Dr. Paige. - This will never hold up in court. - It won't have to. You'll settle out of court for US$5 million. which the company will agree to. Melinda and Klink will split five million. - Minus 30% . - Everyone's a winner. Well, not everyone. According to the settlement, Dr. Paige will lose her license. - Lose my license? - But. there's an island in the Caribbean where you don't need a license. to practice the psychiatric arts. - Grand Cayman. - The Caribbean? - Brilliant. It's a happy ending. - You're the greatest. Give me a hug. Melinda, Roger. congratulations! - We won, we are rich! - This is insane. I won't agree. I want to speak to my attorney. I am your attorney. Every shrink in Idaho has the same malpractice plan. and the same lawyer: Ezri Stovall. As your attorney, and the one voice the insurance company listens to. I recommend we settle out of court. But you never settle out of court. I will. For you. Love means making sacrifices. Sorry, Emily, would you like some champagne? Melinda? Goddamned lawyers and doctors, go to hell! Melinda? Melinda, wait! Roger. - When did you come up with this? - After you fell asleep. I fell asleep? - So we didn't.? - No. I missed it. I took the liberty of reschedule on you for 3 o'clock. It's time! Time? The baby. Melinda! Our bottle! Roger, Roger, get back here! Pull over, we need to talk! Roger! Roger! Careful, Emily. Roger, Roger, hold on! Come on! Come on! Go away! Okay. Alright. Listen, I must've been crazy to risk losing you, okay? Screw the money, screw the lawyers, screw Larry, screw the shrinks. I just want you, I'm begging you. Please, I'm begging you. I need you. We are a team, remember? Sigfrid and Roy ham and cheese. - You don't care about the money? I don't need money to be happy, Mel. I just need you. That's it. I missed you so much. Kiss me. I lied to you. I didn't throw my diaphragm away, or lose it. - You didn't. - It's here, in my purse. - Do you got any of that sauce? - Spermicidal gel? - Say it again. - Spermicidal gel. - Go get it now, we're in business. - ''Mr. Happy''! - Let's not call it that anymore. - What should we call him? - I'll think of something. - Okay. I'll be right back. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, I love birth control. - Why are you laughing? - We are rich. There was a settlement and we get almost US$2 million. We are rich? We can afford one of those track houses. Melinda? Are you alright? God, Danny, it's him! And that's how we got here. - Klink, Paige, Rice. - I need a goddamn program. Turn that damn thing off. I've had about enough. Go get a position near the door, we're going in. - Thank you, lady. - Hurry! - Oh, God! I love you, Danny! - I love you too, baby! Wait, let me try talking to them. Dr. Paige! Dr. Klink! Honesty first, right? I mean, Dr. Paige what do you want from Dr. Klink? And vice versa. Danny and me took your advice. We were finally honest with each other. It worked. Yeah, all relationships are killed by dishonesty, repressed feelings. things left unsaid, things like that. Come on, honesty first. Emily, I wanted to be with you so bad. I was sick after the OTOPI conference. Roger, I want you. I wanted to be close to you since Denver. It's all I've ever wanted. My wife and I got married because of a grammatical misunderstanding. She thought I proposed. I only meant: ''I could'' hypothetically marry her. I only married Mr. Paige to make you jealous. I fantasized that you'd burst into the church and stop it. That was my fantasy. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Let's start over. Honesty first. I was thinking. There's got to be a need for couples' counseling on Grand Cayman, right? That's what I was thinking. I love you, Emily. I love you, Roger. - Don't shoot me! - Oh God, Danny! What the. Melinda, Melinda! Melinda! Go evasive! Go evasive! - Were you shot? - No, it's champagne. Champagne? Get in there, Trousdale. Shit. Careful, Trousdale. Well? The circle. The crisis will be resolved in about 30 seconds, sir. God damn. You two better hold on tight this time. There isn't anybody else in the world that could love you. - Yes, sir. - Don't worry. Consuelo, we are just getting started. God, I love a happy ending.

''Meet the guy from the bank tomorrow.'' ''Case the joint.'' Chapeau, Chameau? Must be somebody's name. Ever heard of him? Means nothing to me. ''Around 8.'' Must be 8 o'cIock or the 8th, I don't know. The two brothers go in. Marchand disagrees. He wants to go in. ''Why can't the other guy wait in the car?'' They argue. A number. OId guy takes notes from photos. Road map. They taIk about money. Marchand says numbers, gesticuIates. I get it. One guy suppIies the pIans. The others puII the job. Marchand hasn't a cIue. He's never robbed anything. Why do they say 5-6? - 5-6 o'cIock? - They keep saying 5-6. You haven't heard from her? No. How Iong's it been? - A week. - A week! I assumed it was onIy since yesterday. Something must have happened to her! Have you toId the poIice? If I had, they'd be here. I had no reaI reason to worry. Your wife disappears for a week and you don't worry? It's not the first time. She's gone missing before. OdiIe? She stayed a few days with Lucie but aIways came back. I don't understand. You haven't been married 35 years. I don't mean that. Be right with you! I don't get why she never toId me. I'm her sister, after aII. Maybe she didn't teII you everything. I guess so. What's the work today? Finish the BuIto fiIe. CaII MeIdeg, see if the goods arrived. AII set? Try zipping your pants. PauI, fiIe this. You shouId have fixed it Iast week! Now BeIin says the site's on hoId! What are you up to? What is this buIIshit? Don't interrupt! You think I'm dumb? I aIways said it was risky. OK! It's too Iate now. - Maybe. - OK! May I say something? It seems to me. our probIem with LehaIeur is psychoIogicaI. We got off on the wrong foot. I couId try and find a soIution. It can't hurt. Yes! I'm coming. I'm coming. What's your probIem? - Mr. LehaIeur? - What about him? What have I done to you? The neighbors! He's agreeing more and more. See you Iater. She's here. I'II put her on. For you. Mr. MoreI. Sorry, I can't hear you. That's better. It went very weII. Mr. LehaIeur is fuIIy in the picture. Thank you, Mr. MoreI. I'm a bit tired, but OK. Is it the job? Yeah. It never stops. Paperwork, buiIding sites. I'm working around the cIock. Can you cope? No probIem. New naiI poIish? Yes. Like it? - A bit paIe. - ''Rosewood.'' - Can you babysit tonight? - I'm out tonight. It's not so easy these days. - A Iot of work? - Not onIy that. StiII seeing your boyfriend? StiII seeing your boyfriend? - He's not my boyfriend. - But you stiII see him? Yes. A margarita and two beers. Are you done? Your antics with those jerks. What antics? ''What antics?'' - What have I done wrong? - Forget it. Is it them? Why? They're nice. Sure, reaI nice. It's OK. It's over. FeeIing OK? Here. Thanks. - You're hurt. - I'm OK. - Let me see. - Honest. I said I'm OK. I have to go back in. Did you hear me? Are you OK to go? Go in. I'II join you. Go on the roof, I mean. Can you hear me? - Yes. - I'm going back in. 80 francs. Get changed and take her home. She'II direct you. Gimme some smokes. - Leave the car keys on the bar. - OK. Scumbag! Let me heIp you. CarefuI. Mind your head. I hate what he's become. It's that crummy bar. It's changed him. He aIways had an eye for bimbos. What's he Iike with you? Search me. He's the boss. Where does he fuck them? Where does he fuck the bimbos? Upstairs in his office? Why am I asking you? You won't teII me anyhow. I'm the dumb cow and he's the boss. He has to. fuck them somewhere. You want the window open? - I feeI sick. - Sit up. Sit up! Fuck! - What now? - I need to pee. Shit. I'II teII you Iater. What do you want? There's nobody there. No Iights on. I didn't see him. What do we do now? UntiI when? I heard you. No need to shout! What a prick! How can anyone be such a jerk? They were garbage sacks. I onIy saw them for a second. What shape where they? Like. sacks with things inside. What things? CouId be anything! Cash, shoes, cIothes. You shift cIothes at 5 a.m.? Not cash, either. - He didn't come out? - No! I didn't see! He must stiII be asIeep. AII right! - What do we do? - Nothing. What eIse? He'II come down sometime to eat. Then I'II go up. I have to go to the office to work. Go on, then. But Ieave the car. What for? You see me on the subway with the sacks? Don't you trust me? Yes. - We meet where? - Dunno. I'II caII you. Can you pick up some cIothes from my pIace? There's one thing I don't get. If your wife disappeared 3 weeks ago, why did you onIy report it yesterday? She often went off to stay with her sister in Désertines, near MontIuçon. - You have no chiIdren? - No. She couIdn't. I aImost forgot. I put something aside for you. What's upstairs? Two bedrooms and a. a shower, not reaIIy a bathroom. - And there's a ceIIar? - A fuII-size basement. These are the. the most recent photos, from Iast year. <i>lt's me.</i> - Where are you? - <i>ln the car. He just came out.</i> I'm going in. - Eat with us? - No. Back in a haIf hour. Gimme some smokes. - Where's the other guy? - He'II be right back. Any Iuck? Fuck aII! I Iooked everywhere. Nothing! - You searched? - Yes! Everywhere! The onIy sacks were fuII of garbage! What you put me through! I'II go. Yeah, right. If he shows, caII me. Give me the key. Give me the key. Where's my vodka? Set the boss's tabIe. He's coming. Where is he? A Iot? Meet me at the car. Then what? Then? We get the heII out. Then what? What do you mean, then? Then you spIit, is that it? So what? Go if you want, but without the cash. - That wasn't the deaI. - No. You were supposed to find it. Let go. I'II be in the car. Come in ten minutes or I'II be gone. Stop it. Shit! - Where's PauI? - He just went out. Something wrong? Where is it, motherfucker? Where is it? - What? - The money! - Where is it? - I don't know! Where's the money, motherfucker? Where is it? What's he done? Stay out of this. Don't ask questions. Don't ask. Just go downstairs. When the Carambos arrive, staII them and warn me, OK? Go on. - Where is it? - I don't know! Where is it? I know nothing about it! Shit! Motherfucker! TeII them anything! Say I'II be there in an hour. Give them a drink. Yes, I'm upstairs! Wait there. I'II come down! I'm coming down. Wait! What do I do now? Say something. Quick! Ticket! Do as I say. Marchand. His wife. SIow down! Go to. Go to her pIace. SIower! Yes, Iike that. Good! HoId on, I'm coming! I got a probIem with the money! He ripped off the money! Who did? Stop sniffIing Iike a faggot! <i>Who's there?</i> You don't know me. You are Mrs. Marchand? <i>Yes. Why?</i> It's about your husband. It's important. <i>Has something happened to him?</i> I'm his mistress. Mrs. Marchand? Are you there? Stop hitting him! I'm sick of picking him up. - Give up. He can't taIk. - Let me. - I'II make him taIk. - Shut the fuck up. You screwed us. Now I ask the questions. I've known him for six months. We fucked every day. We were going to South Africa tomorrow. I don't understand. You're not his type at aII. They were mostIy bIondes and pretty, at Ieast. It was physicaI. We fucked Iike animaIs. I'd never imagined it. What? Like a mindIess piece of meat. Yesterday I heard he had another woman. I can't take that. You understand? Where did you do it? The studio above the cIub. He even gave me the key. Can you hear me? SpiII it or we're dead. I'II give you haIf my share. I don't understand. - It's my wife. - Go on. It's me. What do you want? Get Iost. Take a piII and go to bed. What's up with her? She's drunk. Ignore it. D<i>on't hang up on me, you prick!</i> <i>You're going to talk!</i> - What now? - <i>l know everything.</i> What, you dumb cow? About you and the sIut. <i>Your false l</i>D<i>.

Who's with you? <i>ls that a plane ticket</i> <i>in your coat, or what?</i> <i>Take your plane, scumbag!</i> - <i>l'm keeping the dough!</i> - What dough? The dough you just stoIe!

SubtitIes by NigeI PaImer LOGO$ SubtitIing Paris Hello. When I think about that time it's not the heat, the dust, the nuns or even the boys I remember so much as a sense of anticipation. The constant belief that somehow I'd be saved. I wouldn't say we had it bad since it was all most of us knew. It was only there was something just out of reach and we might never catch up. Lights out, boys. May you be blessed and sleep with God's benevolent grace. Amen. Sparks. Someone's coming. I don't remember who wrote ''I love a sunburnt country'' but I'd bet money they never lived out here. Just look at it. It's the definition of desolate. This is where I lived most of my young years. This is where I lived until, you could say I was rescued by a dream. These were my best friends. Spark, Spit and Maps. My real name's Vernon, but they call me Misty. No reason to go into that right now. Today's the first of December the December boys please come forward. They say the best place to start is the beginning. So, first off, you better know we were all orphans. - Happy birthday. - Thanks, Sister. Thanks, Sister. Thank you. Everybody ready? It's about the smokes. I told you she looks under the mattress. - I didn't put them there. - It's about mooning Willie. Enter. Come in, boys. Father Scully this is James, Donald, Bruce and Vernon. Better known as Maps, Spark, Spit and Misty. They're our December boys. - Happy birthday. - Thank you, Father. We have a little surprise for you. Oh, it's a pleasant surprise. A benefactor has left St. Gregory's a little money and I've decided to send everyone on a holiday. As this is your birthday month I felt it fitting you should be the first to go. We're going on a holiday? You'll be staying with Mr. And Mrs. McAnsh. They're great friends of the Church. It's a town called Lady Star Cove. It's a special place on the sea. On the sea? Yes. It could be that Our Lady interceded for you. I had this spiritual antenna other people didn't have. That's why I could see things no one else could. When I looked at Our Lady, I knew. I knew she'd chosen me for a special mission. Maps. It was more than being orphans that tied us together. Or even our friendship. It was like destiny. Cross swords. We were even given the same birth month. All for one, and one for all. December boys. The further we traveled from what we knew the more it seemed like we were being pulled into another world a world where all the doors were open and anything was possible. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. The most bone-rattling, jaw-clenching death-defying act you've ever seen! The Wall of Death! The one, the only, the bravest man on two wheels Fearless Forte! - You all right there, boys? - Yes, Father. - Come along. - Come on, fellows. Right you are. Welcome aboard. Boys, this is Petty Officer Bandy McAnsh. Father. Petty officer. As you can see, all present and accounted for. Boys, I'd like you to meet my lovely wife and the skipper of this establishment, Mrs. McAnsh. Nice to meet you. Father, we thank God for your safe arrival. May his grace light your paths and give you the appropriate wisdom and joy from your new experience. - Amen. - I knew there'd be a catch. Petty officer, show the new recruits to their quarters and I'll finish in the galley. Well, have fun, boys. Thank you, Father. Right. Step this way. Welcome aboard. All right, mateys. It's been a long day. Time to settle down. Everyone in bed. And we'll let the Old Specific sing you a lullaby. Good night, boys. The ocean's loud. - I didn't think it'd be this loud. - Yeah. The Old Specific. Hey, Spit, have a look at this. Hey, what's that? I suppose you know you'll be going to hell? Really? Now I'll have company. Knock it off, both of you. I'm trying to relax. You hear that? Is he coming? Listen. My ass is snoring. Come on, mate. Last one in's a rotten egg! Really? Looks like you're the rotten egg, Spit. Come on, Mist. Come on, Misty. - Come on. - Come in. Have a look at this. Spark, come on. Yeah, coming. Hey! Hey! - Hey, fishing boat. - Hello? - Hey. - Over here. Hey, over here. Look. Come on. Race you to the rocks. Hey, fellows. Somebody's set themselves up. Check out the cordial. - Maps. - They're somebody else's. Don't take any. Hey. Who wants a ride? Coming back down. Hey, guys. What is it? Find out. She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen other than Our Lady. Sleek as a seal. Mind you, I hadn't seen nearly as much of Our Lady. Sparks. Come on. Sparks, get up. Come on. Get up. We heard you were coming. I'm Teresa. This was as close as I'd come to a religious epiphany. But whatever ideas I had about becoming a priest quickly climbed into the back seat. How did you get these names? We call him Spark because he stuck a knife in a toaster and nearly set the orphanage on fire. And you? You are Spit? My dad flew a Spitfire during the war. And I'm a champion spitter. - And you, you like maps. - No. He's got a birthmark on his chest shaped like Tasmania. I'm all right. If he doesn't want any, I'll have seconds. And why are you Misty? Because he's a waterworks. Okay. I'm going now. Fearless is home tonight. Who's that? That's Shellback. He fishes for Henry. Is Henry a person or a fish? O, my good angel whom God has appointed my guardian watch over me during this night and protect me from evil in my thoughts as well as my deeds. In the deepest hour of darkness let your presence lead the way to righteousness and goodness. Boys. God cares nothing for motorcycles. Henry. - You're gonna get us in trouble. - I know how to ride one of these. My dad had one, only bigger. Bullshit, your dad died when you was 3. Get down. Somebody say you could climb up there? We was just looking. That what you call it? We're here on holiday. My dad had a bike just like this. That so? I saw you on the Wall of Death. I saw you go through the fire and everything. You must be about the best cyclist there is. - You boys like a thrill, do you? - Yeah. Who's first? I've been on a bike before. I'll go. Faster. Faster. Yes! At least someone's having a good time. How you going? Good night. See you later. ''How you going? '' You'll be up her like a rat up a drainpipe. Come on, give us a go. Why do we have to be stuck here? - That's easy. - No, it's not. I'm not stuck. Go. Go. The least you can do is three cheers for the corpse. Hip, hip, hurray! Boys. Thanks, Luce. - Yeah, thanks. - Thank you, Lucy. That is the same sort of thing that happened to Archbishop O'Donnell. I was there in the church Sunday morning come to the end of the sermon, and he says: ''Therefore, many are cold but few are frozen.'' And it was the middle of winter. You know, it's good with Lucy around this summer. - Give Tess some girl company. - By the way, how's her father doing? Still looking for work in Darwin. Five minutes to dinner. - Thanks, darling. - Cheers, Teresa. Hey, he just swiped your beer. Let them have their fun. Wait for me. Wait. I don't expect it's a picnic where they're from. For all you hear, it's not too bad out there. They're well cared for. Yeah, I'll bet they are. I think I'll go and see if I can give the girls a hand. Still, it's not the same as a family. Indeed, it isn't. I think Tess blames me for taking her away from her family. Her country. We're supposed to be starting our own out here. You know, maybe it's the accident that shook something loose. Well, there's no substitute for family, that's for sure. You're not saying you're giving up hope? No. I'm not saying that. It's just you get to a point, you know? You start to see things like they are. Sure never pictured a life without kids. The pity of it is, there are children just like those boys next door, desperate for a good home. And here you are, desperate for children. You got a point there, Father. We want a kid and they need parents. We could just line them up and pick which one we like the best. They get you? What happened? My glasses got knocked off. We saved you some. I'm going to bed. Come on, Spit. Dad. Thank you, Vernon. More tea? There you are. I want you all to take notice of how sharp young Vernon looks this morning. Good on you, son. You all right? If it's all right, I'd like to say grace. That'd be lovely, Vernon. O Lord, we beseech thee in your wondrous grace and thank you for the food we're about to receive. Amen. Amen. Got you. Hey, get back. No. Don't leave me here. No. - No fair. - Yeah. - I got you already. - You didn't. - You're it. - No. If you get me, I'll kiss Sister Beatrice. Hey, you can't run around the cross. Where is my precious Misty? He's been adopted. He was always the best of the lot. You the one living in the cave? I don't live there. I just come up here to observe. You can come up if you want. You one of them orphan kids? Yeah. - What's your name? - Maps. So, what are you observing? You had a good look at these rocks? I've seen them. Haven't you noticed anything strange? They are weird-looking. They were left here by aliens. Same as Stonehenge. You ever heard of Stonehenge? Kind of. Well, it's the same. When they come back, I'll be ready. People from outer space? Of course. I don't guess you see many women where you're from. Nuns, mostly. Nuns. Yeah, I've seen some of those. Want some? It's my last one. By the way my name is Lucy. Good to meet you. - Hey, look, what's that? - Yeah? Come on, Spit. - Hey, wait up. - No. Dirty trickster. Look at all this. Oh, check out the net. And this is a spear. What do you reckon he does with this? What the hell do you think you're doing? We was just looking around. Seeing as you can see so well, can you read that sign? That's a heavy line you got there. What are you fishing for, Moby Dick? When it rains, Spark's the best fisherman at Bible Creek. You see a creek around here, boy-o? He's worried I'll catch Henry before he does. What do you know about Henry? A fish is a fish. Henry's a king of fishes. He's a masterpiece. He was swimming in these waters long before you were born. He's bigger and smarter than you will ever be. Get lost. Can't I make a suggestion without getting my bloody head bit off? It's not a suggestion. You gave up. For chrissake, Tess. Listen to me. All right? I'm not saying that we won't have a baby. All I'm saying is we should talk about adopting one of those kids that needs a home. I talked to someone at the archdiocese. It's possible. That's all I'm saying. So you've decided. No. Tess. No. Tess, you're not listening to me. No. It's your fault I can't have babies. Whoa, look at that. - Come on, put some more on. - You don't need any more. She's getting naked. No. Guys, wait. Wait. Go slow. Quick, run. I'll yell. Misty, I know there's gotta be a very good explanation for that so why don't you come out and tell us what it is? I promise nothing will happen to you. No. Just remember, I keep you from getting killed and soon we'll all be back at St. Greg's. That's what you think. Boys I have great news. Father Scully is taking confession today. Clean slate. Just in time for Christmas, eh? - Great. - Beauty. - Ripper. - Yeah, great. Next. Vernon. What's troubling you, son? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. How long is it since your last confession? About three weeks. I've had some unclean thoughts. And I pulled a face at one of the sisters. Is that all? Not exactly. Oh, come on, lad. I'm gonna need basting in a minute. Let's say there was something you wanted. You know, something you wanted more than anything. And you had an advantage because the others don't know. What is the point in giving it up? I mean. Look, I can't guess, son. You're gonna have to tell me. It'll ease your mind if you unburden yourself. I heard something. Can you tell what he's saying? Something about big breasts. What? If you keep this knowledge to yourself, are you being fair with the other boys? I think you should tell them. The burdens and the joys of this world are always better shared. Do you understand me? I've got to share. That's right. Now, for your penance, you say five Hail Marys. Something else happened last night. Save it till next time. I'm cooked. Oh, Hail Mary. Oh, Hail Mary. It's time to come clean. Get off me. My arm can't breathe. Tell us or we'll slag you. Now then, I wouldn't want anything coming out of Spit's mouth landing on my face. I'll tell you. Fearless and Teresa are gonna adopt one of us. I swear. Let him up. - I swear. - When? I don't know. Before we leave. They're gonna choose which one of us they like best. Why would they want us? We're too old. Speak for yourself. We're not as old as you are. Did they say who they want? You don't know which it is. - Where are the others? - I'm not sure. My real name's Vernon. You know, Africa is just over there. Vernon, do you remember your parents? I think I do but maybe it was a photo. My dad was tall and tan. And my mother had long, dark hair. She was smiling. They died in a car accident. I don't know why I wasn't there. Nobody ever told me. If my parents were still alive, I'd never let them out of my sight. What's he doing? That's Socrates. Shellback says he catches fish and feeds them to the cats. Have you seen him do it? No, but I believe a lot of things I can't see. Me too. You ever think about running away? There's no place to run. When I get 18, they make you leave anyway. Like music? So, what do you do for fun out there? When it floods, we can swim or go fishing. We have a footy team and a choir. Can you sing? Not really. Try singing this. I'm no good. Give it a go and I'll give you a prize. Listen. What'd you think? That was good. That was your first kiss, I bet. I can teach you if you want. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying I'm a better rider than Fearless. All I'm saying is that what he does ain't as hard as it looks. You're full of it. You've never ridden a bike in your life. It's all right to be jealous, Misty, my little mate. Me and Fearless have something in common that you'll never have. Hey, what was that for? Get back here. Get you later, you little mongrel. We've come to tell you, Vernon you're to be adopted. You can stay here as long as you like. And now for some excellent cartwheels. He's not good for much, but at least my uncle can make decent grog. Who do you think they'll choose? I don't know. Spit's clever. He can fix most anything. Misty's the youngest, and he's a good artist. And Spark's got good energy. He's the fastest, wins all the races. What about you? Aren't you good at anything? I know it's not singing. Well, I don't wanna be adopted. What's the big deal about parents anyway? Where have you been? I think Skipper's dead. What do you mean dead? Well, lads the skipper's a bit under the weather tonight so I suppose it'll be bread and jam for tea. Anyway, as the next highest-ranking officer she has asked me to carry on. I think it's appropriate and not out of place to give you your Christmas gifts tonight. - Any objections? - No. Right, good show. - Merry Christmas. - Thanks, Bandy. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Bandy. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - And merry Christmas. - Thanks, Bandy. Merry Christmas. What is it? Well, I don't suppose you've seen one of these but every ship has one. It's called a gyroscope. Keeps your vessel balanced. It's like the ship's conscience. I'll leave the bread and jam on the sideboard. Thanks. If Misty's right, they'll send us packing. - Misty's always making stuff up. - We've gotta go and have a closer look. - I'm not going in their bedroom. - Me neither. Then Misty and me will go. When Bandy goes out, we'll go in. Remember, we don't know anything. So just look cheerful. What happened to Misty? He's shining his glasses. Hey. Merry Christmas, boys. - Where's Misty? - He's coming. - He's always late. - He can't be trusted. Here he is. - What do you got there, mate? - I made you two a present. Thanks, buddy. All right. Now that you're all here, me and Tess have got a surprise for you. Now, we weren't real sure about the sizes, but they all got drawstrings. So. - Misty. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Spark. Merry Christmas, boys. Well, go on, open them up. Open them up. - Thanks. - Thank you. Where's Bandy and Skipper? Well, Mrs. McAnsh is a bit sick, but Bandy will be by later. Okay. - All right, that's French for ''let's eat.'' - Sit where you like. Skipper? Skipper? Skipper? She wasn't such a bad old stick. She looks like a car without a driver. I saw Bandy giving her pills, but I never knew how bad she was. I hope she didn't suffer. Well, she's probably up there, in heaven looking down on us, thinking: ''What's those silly buggers doing? '' Go on. Touch her. - I'm not touching her. - I will if you go first. Don't be a nancy. Pray with me. I'll look after her, doctor. I'll be back tomorrow evening. Father. Father tell the boys to come in. Sorry. We just wanted to. Wanted to know what was happening. I know. Come closer. I'm sorry you have to see me like this. I must look a fright. It was selfish of me to invite you here but I thought it'd be nice to have some young energy in the Cove. And I was right. It's just my disease won't cooperate. What's wrong with you? I got cancer. Will we have to go back now? I was hoping you'd stay. Bandy's taking it hard and I know you boys can help lift his spirit. Well, it's the calling. They say no matter how hard you don't want to do it if God wants you, he'll get you. But what if you just didn't do it? - I mean, you could refuse. - That's what I'm saying. You can't not do it. I had a teacher once who told me she was called. She tried to fight it. She traveled through Europe drinking, having sex like nobody's business. But she knew she couldn't be happy until she was a nun. Do you think you'll get called? I sure hope not. But it's like you're metal and God's the biggest, most powerful magnet ever made. So do you think you'll be a priest? Hell, no. I go to a Catholic school, but it's not like they turn you into one. They teach you other stuff. Father Maps. I've been a very bad girl. Why have you been a bad girl, Sister Lucy? Well, Father, I've been thinking about a boy. You have? I like him. I let him touch me. Everywhere. Kiss me on the neck. I like that. Come closer. Pull down your pants. Hey! Hey! Get out of my boat! Nobody gave you permission! Get out! Serves you right. I want you to always remember me as your first. No worries. Where? Where? I can't see anything. I told you. You're seeing things. Hey, Maps, you can see her public hair. What's on your neck? What did you do? Maybe you'll figure it out when you're older. Let me go. Come on, get off. Henry. I caught Henry! He's mine! Yes! Yes! Yes, I caught him! I told you I would and I did! Yes! I'm the best fisherman in the Cove! Yes! Oh, yes! You saw me, I caught him! Yes! Told you I'd catch him! You could have him if you want. You could stuff him and put him up in your hut. Get a spade and give him a proper burial. Mr. Watson? What's the picture like? I'm up top. Can you make out anything? Should be something Christmassy. Is Lucy here? Lucy? No. She's gone up to Darwin to her dad. When is she getting back? Maybe next summer. I'll give you some to take for Bandy. I don't mean to be rude but this is the best meal I've had since I got here. It's the best meal I've ever had. This is the best meal l'll ever have. Aren't you hungry, Maps? You know, I've never been to the outback. What's it like? You can't fish unless it floods. It's boring. It's a hundred times better here. How about you, Maps? Are you homesick? I like the outback all right. You can count on things out there. I guess it's what you're used to. You well and truly screwed yourself. You might as well have said you didn't want to be adopted. You think getting adopted is gonna fix anything? You don't get it. Everyone leaves. Up to this time, Maps thought we were all in the same boat. Now We realized he was hanging off the side on his own. I never fully understood why Maps reached out to Fearless that night and I never asked. - Tickets for the Wall of Death. Get your tickets for the Wall of Death. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls the most bone-rattling jaw-clenching nail-biting death-defying act you've ever seen. The one, the only, the bravest man on two wheels Fearless Forte! Get your tickets for the Wall of Death. The bravest man on two wheels. Son, he's just over there. Go on. Get a move on. It's not smoko yet. What are you doing here? Maps. Hey. You're shit. - Maps. - You lied. You're a liar like all the rest. You made out you're some kind of a hero, but you're nothing. You're worse than nothing. It's a job, man. Stop lying. Like you could ever adopt one of us. Like you've got the right to be our father. You're a nobody. We don't need you. - Maps. - We don't need anyone. Maps. Do you want a lift home? Clive! Get your ass back here now. Where have you been? - Where's the others? - Looking for you. We've been worried about you. You must let us know where you are, son. Son? What are you doing? Get your things. Now. We're leaving. Come on! - Get your stuff. - Where are we going? Home. It's all been a lie. - Just shut up and get your stuff! - Stop! Misty, get off! I'm trying to look after you! Nice spot you got here. Shit. The little bloke do that? You guys fight worse than brothers. We are brothers. Leave me alone. I'll be all right. Yeah, I don't doubt that. What about the others? You just gonna abandon them because you're mad at Lucy? You don't know anything about it. Well, at least there's something that I do know. You're wrong what you said to me. Teresa and me would make good parents. And we would've had a load of kids around now if it weren't for me. I crashed the bike with Tess on the back. We used to be a team in the shows. She spent half a year in hospital. And I tried to keep it going on my own, but. Does Teresa know? Tess always knows. Help! Help me! Maps! Maps! Help! Help! Anyone, help! Maps! Help, it's Misty! Hang on, Misty! - What happened? - The rip got him. - He fell off the rocks. - Get help. You can't swim! Look at us. We're swimming. I'm drowning. Hang onto me, catch your breath. Shellback! Really, we tried to save you. We did. I was trying to save you, I swear. I came into the water. It was up to my neck. I went to the McAnsh's, and. But then I went to Shellback. How you feeling, boys? I'm better than I was. I gotta say, mate you're braver than me, going out there not knowing how to swim. Well done. I was just a couple of feet away from you. You were 75 yards out or something. - I could almost grab. - Who wants some soup? Hey? Yeah, okay. I might have saved you. But l. Something just pulled me away. Something just pulled me. Come on. So, what do we got? Did you see her? Thanks. I suppose you're the one. You showed us all up. Yeah. For an old bloke, you came through. I don't want to be adopted. You don't? No. I like. Well, I like things the way they are. My money's on you, Misty. We were running out of time and hope, and there was still no answer. No one seemed to notice that the biggest moment of my life was about to get left behind. I'm tired of waiting. Come through. Come through. So guess you're all packed up. Sit down. Sit down. I wanna know if you're gonna adopt me. I heard you tell Father Scully you were gonna adopt one of us. If you're gonna adopt anyone, it ought to be Misty. - Not so fast. I've got qualities. - I can run fast. - You can't even stay conscious. - Hey, boys. Boys. We've made up our minds. We wish we could adopt all of you. You're all such wonderful boys. We've put in the paperwork and it's just gonna take a little time. Misty we want you to be our son. And we hope you want us for your parents. We're not perfect, mate but we could love you. Good on you, mate. Yeah. Misty's the one, for sure. Well, hey, it's not like we're never gonna see you again. I mean, we're sure to come back and visit and if you're ever in the mood for some boiled lamb, you can come visit us. You boys are gonna come back and say goodbye before you go? Oh, no worries. We'll see him again. See you, fellas. Just remember, Misty, no matter what, you're still a December boy. Yeah. - Hey. - Got you. You're gonna have to run faster than that. Hey. Come get me. Let's go get some souvenirs. Get a crab for Sister Edna. Look at this. Spit. Quick, before it gets away. I don't want you to be mad at me but I can't stay. If I was ever gonna be adopted you'd be the best parents I could have, and that's no lie. But I've already got a family. They'd be lost without me. I know. No hard feelings? No hard feelings, Misty. Go on. Thank you. Look what I found over here. - Give it back, that's mine. - No, I found it. Hey, come on. Well, lads, this is it. I thought if you wanted a keepsake, you might like to take the signal flags. Thanks. The boys would like to say goodbye, Skipper. Thanks, Skipper. Thanks. Hey. Thanks, Skipper. Goodbye. Okay, orphans, disembark. Left, right, left, right, left, right. See you, Bandy. See you, Father. - See you, boys. - Thank you, Bandy. - See you, Bandy. - Bye. Thanks, Bandy. - Bye. - Hey, look. If it weren't for Maps, who knows if any of us would have ever come back. We could have gone on thinking of the Cove like one of those old postcards realer than real with each of us remembering it however we chose. Coming back for the first time after all these years fills me with a mixture of excitement and the fear I made the whole thing up. Believe it or not, Maps did become a priest traveling to Africa to help with the refugees. I got his letter just a few days before his ashes arrived. He told me how often he thought about this place and how happy he was that we could share it together. Maps wrote me before he went that if anything happened. And here we are the December boys. One, two, three, the December boys! Hey! Maps! Hey! Over here! Hey, Maps! See you, fellas! [ENGLISH] Thank you. There you are, guv'nor. Hello!. - How are you? - And Barbara. Barbara's going to be a big movie star. Good to see you. Come on, darling. Here we go. Cigarettes? I'm so glad I could come. You're looking great, Bill. I have to go. I'll call back. See you soon. Well, well, well. - Who's this, then? - He is a very wicked fellow. - Wonderful show. Great fun. - It's fun to do. - You shone. - I didn't have that much to do. Didn't she? Like a light, to the trained eye. Dr Ward has the most highly-trained eye in London. Isn't that right, Stephen? Care to dance? She's upset, your girlfriend. You must give me your telephone number. Impossible. Nothing's impossible, not for you. I've seen her on the telly. She's on the telly, isn't she? Except when she's flat on her back. Oh, Chris, it's lovely. it must've been ever so dear! It's from Marshall & Snelgrove. - Don't spend your money on me. - Why not? I enjoy it. Oh, it's lovely. I love yellow. It suits you. I don't know what your father's going to say. - How is he? - He worries about you. We both do. Well, you shouldn't. I'm having a smashing time. You can always come home, you know that? If.anything should happen. Nothing's going to happen. Oh, Lord! - Who is he? - I met him last week. - He's a doctor. - A doctor? - An osteopath. - A what? He does people's backs. All sorts of famous people. Whatever next? Christine! I was just passing. This must be Mrs Keeler. Delighted to meet you. Well, very nice. Lovely setting. Perfectly lovely. Looks a picture. This is Dr Ward. It's nice in the summer. - How did you find me? - It wasn't hard. I'm a very determined fellow, my dear. I'll stop at nothing, when aroused. Stephen, it's wonderful! You said a cottage. It's just a little place for weekends. Bill lets me have it for a pound a year. - I let him cheat at bridge. - Who's Bill? Lord Astor. He's very sweet. You'll meet him. Come. - Are you married? - Good heavens, no! I was married once for 40 days, years ago. The worst mistake I ever made. Come look at the gardens. They're widely acclaimed. You may have seen them on the front of Country Life. - Feels like a million miles away. - It is. This is all Bill's, as far as you can see. 1 8th century. God gave you beauty. You're lucky. You should enjoy it. You move like a racehorse. You walk like a Derby winner. Let me help you. Introduce you to some friends of mine. Some photographers, film people, television people. It's my vocation, you see. My vice. When I see beauty like yours, wild, untutored, elemental beauty I long to liberate it. It's my life's work, in a way. I could do wonders with you, little baby. I could shock the world. I should be getting back. Mum will be wondering. No. Don't say anything. I'm doing your lips. So I tell Frank and he has a bloody fit. I said, "Look, I don't mind." You got one, you might as well have two. it's only small, but there's hot and cold water. And the bathroom is a scandal. You're out all night. I'm in the surgery all day. - What could be better? - Where would I sleep? You could always curl up with me. - So, that's it. - Don't be silly. That's not what I meant. You can if you like. It's really up to you. We're going to be friends. Very good friends for a very long time. - We must do something about that hair. - You don't like my hair? You'll be happy here. With me. With my friends. - You make it sound like a dare. - Do l? Perhaps I do. Never say no to a dare. You never know what you might miss. Wait. Little baby. Thank you. Are you going to be in there forever? Little baby! That is wonderful. - You don't like my eyelashes? - I prefer your eyes. It's wonderful. Today's victory marks an unprecedented third term for the Conservatives. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan is understandably. My lords, ladies and gentlemen, you lucky people. All together now, you've never had it so good! I'm sure I speak for each and every one of you lucky people when I call three cheers for the Conservative Party and Macmillan. I give you the new Conservative government. - Hip hip! - Hooray! For he's a jolly good fellow He is indeed a man to watch. Rising star of the Conservatives, John Profumo is rumoured to be the next Minister for War. I always had a preference for what the Americans call "heavy petting". It's something I studied at college in Missouri. I adore the oh, so painfully slow escalation of touch and caress, the tiny nibbling kisses, the sigh of silk on milk-white flesh. I love the ache. It can go on for hours and hours. Stephen, you're such a tease. But it's worth the wait. When you come, it's like a sigh. It's like a delicious drawn-out sigh. Dr Ward is the son of a vicar. He's a connoisseur of sin. Rather fun, isn't it? Clive picked it up in Copenhagen. Where's Jennifer? "A" deck. Popped up to tuck the kiddies in. They come in all shapes and sizes. Bound to come in handy, don't you think? For something. Well! All hands on deck. - I'll just put a record on. - Ayee aye, Captain. Wet your lips. You could have said something. - Were you shocked? - Just a bit. - But you enjoyed yourself. - It was funny. That thing on the table. I hated that Clive. Nasty piece of work. I'm told he killed his first wife. It never came out, of course. - Were you frightened? - No, I was not. You mustn't be. Nothing to be afraid of. We're all flesh. No harm in it, so long as nobody gets hurt. Everybody is afraid to enjoy themselves or they're too ashamed to admit it. You're the doctor. You won't leave me, little baby? You won't run away? - Would you run after me? - I don't know what I'd do. You'd find someone else. Another racehorse. I'd never find another Derby winner. What's she doing? Chris, this is Mandy. She's new. She's in my place. Tell her, somebody. She's in my place - Tell her yourself. - I'll sit where I like. Move it. Take all this rubbish and move. She can't just barge in like the Queen of bloody Sheba. Do as she says. There's a space next door. It's cooler. Thank you. Where's my top? Don't be silly. Which one of you stole my top? Don't worry. Nobody will notice. Mandy! Where are you? Hello, Mum. It's me. I'm in London. No, I'm all right, really. Goodnight, Christine. I've got a job. I got a part in a West End show. No, it's only a small part, but if I do well, Mr Murray says. He's the producer. They're putting me up in a hotel. Ever so smart, it is. It's the Piccadilly Palace Hotel. Right on Piccadilly. Yes. Well, it's not really a theatre. It's more like a nightclub, really. Of course I miss you. I miss you both. You mustn't worry, really. I'm a big girl now. I've got to go. There are people waiting for me. I'll write to you, I promise. All right. Bye-bye. Fancy a drink? Where will we go? We could always try the bar at the Piccadilly Palace Hotel. Caught you! Forty quid, Miss. Or it's the police. - Bill, it was awful. - What's happened? I was so frightened. Mandy's been caught. We can't leave her. She'll go to jail. She's only 1 6. - What exactly has she done? - She owes the landlady £40. It's a bit steep, you know. It is, honestly. I don't mind giving you a lift. I don't mind that. You could have told me you were doing a bunk. It's really unfair. I didn't want you to know. I'm sorry. I feel awful, really. I don't know why I do this. I feel so ashamed. Hmm. £40. She'd better be worth it. Peter! Ex-boyfriend. He's filthy rich. Owns half of Notting Hill. You like older men, don't you? Christine. - This is my friend, Mandy. - Hello. Peter Rachman. What did he say? He said he likes your tits. Cigarette? - Thank you, Peter. - Ward. Eugene lvanov. Peter Rachman. - Peter disapproves of me. - Not at all. - He thinks I'm wicked. - Are you wicked? Not as wicked as Peter. I did some sketches of Madame Furtseva. Whatever became of her? - Madame Furtseva? - She's delightful. She says that Khrushchev eats with his fingers. Is that true? Drinks straight from the bottle, so she says. It's good, this. Peter said he'd take me to the opera. Lucky duck. I rather like opera. Mozart and that. You've never been to the opera. - How do you know? - It's obvious. - I've been to The Mikado. - Where's the hairdryer? Where are you going? Where's Stephen? - Where are you going? - Dinner. - Where? - The 21 Club. I know all about the 21 Club. It's a knocking shop. - Don't tell Stephen. - He'll be furious. Not if you don't tell him, he won't. You can come if you like. You don't have to do anything. Not if you don't want to. That's what Nicky says. Nicky's on the game. She's a prostitute. So? There's no harm in it. - We're all flesh, you know. - Not me. - Gin and it. - Champagne cocktail. Don't look now. David Fairfax Jr. He's even more smashing than in the movies. Here he comes. Wet your lips. I'll take care of that, barman. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Hi, girls. - Hello. - Hi. Exciting? You'll never guess who that was. - Animal, vegetable or mineral? - Fictional. I give up. I never read. James Bond. What did he want? Let me guess. A beautiful blonde with her legs in the air? - You think I'm joking, don't you? - You're always joking. Between you and me and these four walls, that was the voice of British intelligence. Ml5. Tie me down. I think he had a spot of hay fever. Hay fever. Good of you to come. Not in the least. I'm always happy to help if I can do something useful. Your friend, lvanov, the naval chap. - Is he a spy? - No idea. - What do you think? - It crossed my mind. You talk, discuss things, exchange views. I'm a curious fellow, Mr Woods. Insatiable, in my way. Interested in a fellow's point of view. You know a lot of people. A lot of young women. Has he ever asked you a favour? Took a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover. If he should ask a favour anything at all. - I'll let you know. - Do. I will. Good. What a little baby! What do you think, Eugene? Come on. Come on, let's have it off. It looks like something my grandmother would wear. Go on, let's have it off! Oh, baby! - Lovely to have you. - It's been a cow of a week. This Kuwait business. The PM is chewing the carpet. Terrible place, Kuwait. Stinks of piss. - What's that? - What's what? - I heard a laugh. - Laugh? Get it off, girl! Good girl! Splendid, girl! Hello, Bill. Shameless hussy. Got you. Christine, meet John Profumo, Minister for War. You'll want this, my dear. Golly! Set. Go. And this is my favourite painting of my favourite city. That could be you and l in the gondola. The trees have such fine brushwork. Do you agree? It's lovely. You have never made love until you have made love in a gondola. I remember a rowing boat once. But never a gondola. Hello, you two. I can't take you home tonight. I've got a slow puncture. I've asked Eugene to take you. You know what I see when I look at this country? - Doom, decay. A land without honour. - It's not that bad. You saw Profumo. He was walking on the bottom at the shallow end. - What kind of man is this? - You're angry 'cause he beat you. He cheated. He was walking on the bottom. He's a Cabinet minister and he cheats at games. Anyway, I bet you don't have houses like Cliveden in Russia. Cliveden is a museum. Russian museums are open to the public. Looks like rain. Poor Eugene. You look so unhappy. Why don't you come up and have a cup of tea? Tea? In Russia, we drink vodka. Christine? - Morning. - Well? - Well what? - What happened? - When? - Last night. - Last night? - With Eugene. You know Eugene. He bellyached all the way back, had a quick cup of tea and went home to dream of Mother Russia. Coffee? I know Eugene better than that. I know you both. Nothing happened, really. I promise. He was talking about his wife. She's a teacher. Look at me. If you must know, it was awful. Awful? Why? - He wept. - He wept? Aren't you going to answer the phone? Hello? - Wept? - Practically. Jack. Stephen Ward here. I'm just about to go out. Would you like to talk to Christine? Jack Profumo. Hello, Jack. That would be lovely. Hello, Jack! Bye, Jack! - Hello? - Mr Woods? Ward. Stephen Ward. I've just spent the most enjoyable weekend. i've been in the country with some very interesting people. - You've changed your hair. - I just washed it. - Eugene says you cheated. - lvanov? He says you were walking on the bottom of the pool. He's a liar. What? I've never been in a Rolls-Royce before. I feel like the Queen. is that all? - That's all. - He didn't touch you? - He was shy. - Shy? What's wrong with the man? He wanted to talk. You know, chat. I saw him at Cliveden. We all did. He was all over you like a cheap suit. Honestly, what did you expect? Did you think he'd rip my knickers off in the back of the Rolls outside the Palace? I expect too much, that's the trouble. Don't worry. He'll ring again. Do you think? No, can't see anyone. - Ask him. - You ask him. He'll never sell it to us. He'll think we're from Scotland Yard. Come on, Christine, be a sport. Give her ten bob, old chap. Good girl. Y'all right, sister? Looking for something? I'm with some people. In the car. They thought. Well, they wondered. They thought there might be some pot about. Pot? - You know. - Yeah. - I think she's got it. - What's it like? Pot? No idea. Stiff Pimms, I suppose. - This is Lucky. - Hello, Lucky. - He wants us to go to a party. - Right now? Right now. The Sound System. I could think of nothing better. The young sound of Jamaica. I love it! - Getting anywhere? - Nothing yet. Well, I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a stiff bourbon. Do you know what I like about you? - My arse. - Correct. You're always so happy. I don't know how you do it. You make me happy, Jack. I must dash. You're always in such a rush. I have an army to run. You do want to be saved from the approaching Russian hordes? Paddington 5268. i been looking for you, sister. You're wonderful, marvellous. You make me feel so. - What are you doing? - I'm a witch. I'm keeping this to put a spell on you. I'm going to be all yours, Jack. Whenever you want me. - I wonder for how long. - As long as you want me. And when I'm gone? When I'm off being the Minister for War, where will you be then? I'm going to buy a present for my mum. It's her birthday. Here. Buy her something from me. It's so funny, they were practically bumping into each other on the stairs. You know Mariella? She's the best-bred harlot in town. Her father's the President of Czechoslovakia. No, darling, my uncle. But he's been dead forever. He's the one with the big nose. Mariella could teach you a thing or two. She had a fling with JFK. Stephen, can I ask you a rude question? Please do. Why don't you take your socks off? Cold feet. Drink, madam? - Bit warm. - Warm, madam? Don't you think? Definitely a bit on the warm side. If you say so, madam. I do. Thank you, madam. - John Profumo. - Never heard of him. He's in the Government. The Minister for War. - What's he like? - You'd like him. - He gave me this lighter. - Chris, it's terrific. - It's from Asprey's. - How do you know? I've seen it in the catalogue. I read all the catalogues. - What does Stephen say? - He thinks it's a scream. He says it's quite a coup that I've been out with a Russian diplomat and a minister for war. Peter says he's a pimp. "That ponce", he calls him. Stephen's not a pimp. He just loves the intrigue. He thinks he's James Bond or something. The sooner you get away from him, the better. You should talk to this agent I know. You could do ads on the telly. He wants me to get a flat. Profumo. I hope you said yes. I can't. I can't leave Stephen. He'd be lost without me. I wish you wouldn't smoke those things in the flat. - It's only a roach. - I won't ask you again. Is he? A spy? Eugene? Bound to be. All Russians are spies. It's the way they're brought up. Looks like an invitation. - So, he is then? - Well, I expect so. Why not? It sounds like fun, and there's a lot of money in it. You'd be hopeless. You'd be the worst spy in the world. You can't keep your mouth shut for five minutes. Well, thank you. What is it? Someone's having a party. - Where's your wife? - lsle of Wight. Fun, aren't they? Valerie bought them in Vienna on our honeymoon. The Queen was here and made such a fuss of them, I'll have to send them to the Palace. - The Queen? - But they're probably fakes. Must be fun, chatting to the Queen. What do you talk about? Fox-hunting? - Thanks. - I'll phone you. - If you like. - Wait. Get in. - What? - Who is that? By the bins. She lives here. She owns the shop round the corner. We can't go on like this. You living here. Ducking and diving. Let me find you a place of your own. I told you, I'm happy as I am. I can't see you while you're living with Ward. Don't be silly. He's not my boyfriend. You know that. Why don't you like him? He can't keep his mouth shut. He's vain and empty-headed. That's not true. - We must get you out of his clutches. - He doesn't clutch. I'm serious. We can't go on seeing each other while you're living with Ward. Well, that's it, then. Darling, please. You must see. People talk. People listen. I have to be careful. Be careful, then. Do what you like. I'm not leaving Stephen for anyone. I don't care if you're the Prime Minister. Come back! Christine! - Smart lighter. - Jack gave it to me. - Comes from. - Asprey's. I know. What's the matter? Why so pouty? Nothing. - You quarrelled? - No. - What about? Not about me? - No. He'll be back. I don't care. I don't like him, anyway. - He'll phone. - He better not. It'd be a shame to lose him. He could be Prime Minister one day. You can't be serious. He looks the part. Youngest MP of his generation, decorated in North Africa. He's got a spotless reputation. He wants me to get a flat of my own. - I hope you said yes. - That's what Mandy said. What did you say? Obviously, I made a mistake. Never mind. It's all right. He doesn't want to come here any more. He doesn't trust you. He thinks he's being followed. - Followed? - Watched. - Watched? - I don't know. - You must ask him. - You ask him! You're the one who's so bloody struck with him. Ask him about the Queen. You'd find that riveting. I've had enough. Stephen, I'm 1 8. I want to go out dancing. I don't want to be. I feel like. I want to have some fun, for a change! Christine. Just give me my money. Don't do that to me. - Johnnie. - What's the matter? Take me home. - Later. - Not later. Now! Keep it. Don't fuck with me. Come to me, now. Lucky! Why do you do this to me? Come out of our house, man! Fuck! Christine! Coffee? It's all right, baby. You're at home, now. It's all right, now. Tell me about Johnnie. Was he huge? You can tell me everything. A chap in the Sudan had one one and a half foot long. I have a photo somewhere. One and a half foot! It was knocking against his kneecaps. - You don't care. - Yes, I do. More than I can say. Stephen. Stephen! Stephen! Mandy? Mandy! - Guess what? I got it! - Got what? The Camay ad! They said yes on the spot! You don't use Camay, I do. Don't be spoilt. Let's go to the hairdresser's. - I've got a headache. - Take a pill. You'll end up in a flat full of black men smoking hash. I'll have to walk home alone. No, I promise. I've finished with that. - You're full of promises. - I mean it. Your agent lined me up with another ad for next week. £90 an hour. You don't even have to take your clothes off. You stand there and wet your lips. Christine! It's him. - Who? - Johnnie. Christine! - Go and look. - You go and look. Tell him I've gone to the hairdresser's. Go on. - What do you want? - Where is she? She's not here. She's gone. I'm just gonna talk to her. Just a few minutes. - She's gone to the hairdresser's. - Christine! - He doesn't believe me. - Christine! - Johnnie. - Open the door for me, now. You must go away. You'll get into trouble. Open this door. I've got a taxi waiting! Johnnie, please! Lucky Gordon's gonna kill me. I got nowhere to go. - I can't. - Christine, please! - I can't. - Please! Here. Take this and go away! Bitch. - You bitch, you see this? - He's got a gun! - Smashing. - Ring the police! Christine, you bitch, come now! Johnnie? Listen to me. Put the gun away. Get me the police. There's a man with a gun. I'll kill you! Dr Ward. I just thought you should know. There's a black man shooting at your front door. It's very kind of you to call. He's gone. Why are you laughing? You think it's funny. - Sorry. I can't help it. - I can't stand it! - There is a limit. - I'm sorry. There comes a point when I say, "No, that's enough. No more." I've said I'm sorry. The Express was there. The Mail. The Mirror. They were all there before the police were there. I'm a doctor. I can't have it, Christine. I've got patients, I've got a certain position, I've got a reputation. I can't have lovesick jungle bunnies running amok on the front door taking pot shots at the windows. It's monstrous! You took me down there. You wanted to snoop round Westbourne Grove at one in the morning. I never wanted to go. You made me. I'd never have met Lucky if it wasn't for you. I'd never have met Johnnie or any of those people. - It was all your idea. - You go too far. "Be a devil," you said. "Never say no to a dare." You took me to parties and introduced me to everybody. I'm yours, Stephen. You pull the strings. I'm what you made me. - I'll drop you. - Where? Wherever you want to go. Vicky's. - I can't go there. - Well, you say. Let's go for a drive. Please, Stephen. Take me home. It's over, little baby. It's over. Good evening, Miss. Miss Keeler? My name's Kevin, from Sunday Pictorial. Could we have a word? Sit down. Cup of tea. I know a place not very far from here. Cup of tea? It's all Stephen's fault. It was all his idea. - Did he give you money? - Who? - Profumo. Did he pay you? - I'm not a prostitute! No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. What I meant was a little gift, a token of his affection. He gave me this. Did he ever write you any letters? Maybe a couple of notes. Notes? You kept them? I put them away somewhere. It was months ago. Yeah, well, you should look for them. It's all Stephen's fault. - You got your gumboots on? - Why? This shit's deep. Run your little West End shoot-'em-up tomorrow. Say "West indian Held in West End Shooting". Use a big picture. But listen, that's not the half of it. If what this tart has told me is true, we are sitting on dynamite. Here's the headline. "The War Minister, the Model and the Russian Spy. " - Yeah? Great. - I thought you'd like that. Get her to sign something. She must sign something. Offer her money. Just get her signed. All right, will do. i'll be there later. Ted! Thank you. Isn't that the girl we saw at Cliveden? The one by the pool. Is it? - You must remember. - Yes. Christine something. I'm sure it's her. Keeler. - Times, please. - Times? Well, well, well. - lsn't that.? - Yes, it is. Well, that's torn it. She must be stopped. She's talking to everybody. Yes. If it's a matter of money. What Christine needs is a holiday. Bit of sun on her back. Somewhere quiet. Spain, Portugal. - Just the job. - lt'll do her good. You don't think she might.kick up a fuss? Leave Christine to me. I dreamt her up. I can make her vanish. Who's that? It's a cousin of mine. I won't be a moment. Excuse me. There was a letter. A note. - I know. - Silly of me. Yes, it was rather. I'll see if I can get it back, if you like. There was nothing in it. I've nothing to hide. Come off it. We all have something to hide. What a rum life it would be if we didn't. I never touched her. You know that. Never laid a finger on her. Goes without saying. - Thanks, Ward. - Not a bit. What are friends for? Stephen, all right? Where's my cigarettes? You want to wake up to yourself. The papers have been ringing. You could buy your mum a new house. I feel sick. You worked for it. You deserve every penny you can get. - There'll be trouble. - What's to lose? Look at me with Peter. What have I got? - Earrings. - Earrings. You want to wake up to yourself. What are you waiting for? What did Profumo do for you? He won't look after you in your old age. You and he might call it a bit of fun. I'll tell you what I call it. Theft. - Stephen'll kill me. - Stephen's a rat. All he cares about is his own neck. - That's not fair. - He threw me out. I paid a month's rent and he threw me out. You should hear what he says about you. "That Christine," he says. He reckons you've ruined his life. It's not true. He wouldn't say that. Ask him. Ring him up. - I'll ring him up, if you like. - No. He's no friend of yours. You want to wake up to yourself. It's lovely. Lovely stuff. £1,000. There's a lot you can do with a thousand smackers. I need a break. They're calling me back to Moscow. Things will only get worse. Today, it's my neck. Tomorrow, it may be yours. Don't worry about me. No salt mines here. They will be looking for someone to take the blame. In Russia, we say a "goose". You mean a "goat". A scapegoat. It'll all blow over, you'll see. These things always do. Next week, they'll all be talking about something else. Mr Profumo! Do you know where Miss Keeler is? Can't you do something? Make them go away. - What can I do? - Do something. Order. The Right Honourable John Profumo, personal statement. With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal statement. I understand that my name has been connected with the rumours about the disappearance of Miss Keeler. I last saw Miss Keeler in December 1 961, and I have not seen her since. I have no idea where she is now. Any suggestion that I was in any way connected with or responsible for her absence is wholly and completely untrue. My wife and I first met Miss Keeler at a house party in July 1 961 at Cliveden. I met Miss Keeler on half a dozen occasions at Dr Ward's flat when I called to see him and his friends. Miss Keeler and l were on friendly terms. There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler. Hear, hear. Order. The Estate Agent's Bill. Second reading. I beg to move that the bill be now read a second time. This bill concerns the profession and others serving the public. Get me Scotland Yard, please. Thank you. Mariella Novotny? Scotland Yard. Lady Astor? It is Lady Astor, isn't it? i did the right thing. i kept my mouth shut. I'm in an appalling position. I'm under investigation myself. It's monstrous. They've talked to all my friends. You're hard to ignore. You have so many friends. It's monstrous. You know such a wide variety of people. I'm on trial by hearsay. I don't quite understand what you're getting at. Call off the dogs. If the police persist in ruining my reputation and livelihood, badgering my friends and digging up women I haven't seen for years, then I have no choice but to defend myself. Firstly, I needn't remind you that the police are not under the jurisdiction of the Conservative Party. They do their business as they see fit. I am in no position to call them off. You leave me no alternative. Secondly, it would appear that you are proposing to blackmail the Government. I must tell you that would be most unwise. I've always been a good friend to Jack Profumo. I like to think that I am loyal to my friends and that my friends are loyal to me. I hope they are, Doctor. You're going to need all the friends you can get. Christine! Mum. - Are you all right? - Chris, look at you. What have you gone and done now? It's not me. It's everyone else. Christine! Hello? Just one moment, please. A Dr Ward. I'm sorry. There's nobody here by that name. Quite sure. - Paddington 5628. - Stephen. - Hello, Bill! - Yes. - I'm sick about this, Stephen. - Cheer up. We'll all pull through. - We all are. - So long as we stick together. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. How was New York? Bronwen likes it. The shops. I'm glad we could meet and talk. I've been thinking about the cottage. - The cottage? - Yes. I've had a talk to one or two of our legal chaps. They seem to think I should have it back off you, with things as they are. - Have it back? - The cottage. I'll fix you up for the improvements. Bill, you're throwing me out. You see what a spot I'm in. I think it would be better all round. I thought about £200 for the improvements. You could pop the keys in the post. Yes, of course. You've been under a lot of strain. I know that. I can tell. You're worried sick. You're frightened. You're frightened you might go to prison. I haven't done anything. It was Johnnie Edge. Piss on Johnnie Edgecombe! You see my point? Johnnie Edgecombe, Lucky Gordon, they're bunnies. The jungle's full of bunnies like them. Ward is a different class of animal. Your ponce. - He's not a ponce. - I've known a lot of whores. A lot of prostitutes. I used to be at Mayfair North End. I can smell them. Can't l, John? - I can smell the pink Camay. - I'm not a whore. These clients of yours, these gentlemen friends that Ward introduced you to, how much did you charge them? Twenty quid? Thirty? I'll bet you charged them thirty quid at least, a beautiful young girl like you. - How much did you give to Ward? - Nothing! I've told you. I've told him. How many more times must I say it? I never gave Stephen money. I chipped in for the phone bill. I may have bought a tin of Nescafe. We were friends, we shared. He didn't keep me. Tight, was he? Mean? I should think you kept him, more like. Why do you hate him so much? Hate him? I don't hate him. It's not my job to hate people. My job's to root out the filth. Cup of tea? Thanks. You can't save him. We know it all. Profumo, lvanov, Rachman, the man in the mask, the works. Ward's for the drop. There's nothing anybody can do for him. Profumo's an MP. Astor's a lord. Ward's just a jumped-up little ponce from Torquay. He's not even a proper doctor. You don't understand. I love Stephen. He's the only man I've ever loved. - Morning. - Morning. The Secretary of State for War has written to the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has asked me to read that letter to you. "Dear Prime Minister, you will recollect that on March 22nd, "following certain allegations made in Parliament, "i made a personal statement. "i said that there had been no impropriety "in my relationship with Christine Keeler. "To my regret, i must admit that this was not true. "i cannot remain a member of your administration "nor the House of Commons. "i cannot tell you of my deep remorse "for the embarrassment i have caused to you, "to my colleagues, my constituents, "and the party i have served for the past 25 years. "Yours sincerely, Jack Profumo." Sorry, that is the end of the statement. Of course it's a security problem. Don't be so silly! A secretary of state for war can't have a woman shared with a spy, or if he was a spy, without a security risk. The question is not whether it was a security risk but whether there was any breach of security. it's silly to make this a party issue. A scandal can arise in one party and it can arise in another. Let's recognise it for what it is. A scandal. A great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proved liar. A party of great principles and policy, a party which believes things about the country and the world, that has great convictions, does not depend upon squalid morals. What we've got to do is to clear up the facts, establish the facts, punish the guilty. Thank you, Lord Hailsham, Conservative Leader of the House of Lords. I've always been afraid of this. Dreaded it. Nightmares. I've always been afraid that the day would come when they'd throw me to the dogs. Ever since I can remember, since school. There was a boy there who snored, called Follet. He slept in the next bed to me. I know he suffered from asthma, but he kept us all awake. One night, one boy got fed up and hit him. He didn't hit him hard. He just slapped him across the face, but it fractured his skull. He had a weak skull, Follet. He was in a coma for weeks. You can imagine the hue and cry. I knew who'd hit him, of course. A few of us did. But nobody would tell. You just didn't do that. So, because I was the nearest, they picked on me. They knew I hadn't hit him, but they knew I knew who had. But I didn't sneak. You simply simply didn't do that. The house master dragged me out in front of the whole school and gave me a thrashing. A few years later, I met him at a wedding. God knows why he was there, and I asked him, "Did you really think that I was to blame?" Know what he said? He said, "Someone had to have a thrashing, Ward." "lt just happened to be you." It just happened to be me. Well, not again. Not this time. This time, I'll split. This time, I'll drag them all down with me. I bet you don't. Hello, Stephen. Let's go back to the old in-and-out. What about the man in the mask? Did she tell you all about that? Christine? She told us the lot. She missed out the best bit. Yeah? What was that? You tell us the best bit. It really was rather extraordinary. Mariella had this little glass jar full of bees. - Bees? - Bees. Angry bees. Somehow, she managed to screw this glass jar on to his bollocks. And you can imagine what that was like. She'd sprayed Chanel on to his bollocks. Apparently, bees can't stand Chanel. Drives them mad. You're for the drop, Ward. You know that, don't you? You're finished. They've all dropped you. All your mates. All your lords and ladies, all your MPs, your royalty. They're all rushing off to America on urgent business. Nobody wants to know. You haven't got a friend in the world. It's no use thinking your Ml5 mates will come up the Thames in a midget submarine. This isn't your James Bond. - I said, it's not your James Bond. - No. You stink, Ward. You're a stinking little ponce. And I've got 1 47 people who say the same. 1 47. Know how many witnesses we normally interview on a charge of poncing? Three or four. Five at the most. And we generally get a result. 1 47, Ward. That's 1 47 different interviews. Me and John have been busy. We've been at it round the clock. You'd be amazed at some of the people we've dug up. Real filth, eh, John? Real pox-ridden harlots. Oh, dear. Look at that. A prostitute is not necessarily the kind of woman that one pictures when one normally uses that word. It is not necessary for her to ply her trade on the street corner. Prostitution, as a matter of law and for the purposes of this case, is where a woman offers her body for sexual intercourse, that is, normal sexual intercourse, or for any acts of lewdness, for money. I swear that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. How did you pay the rent at Comeragh Road? I didn't pay the rent at Comeragh Road. - How was it paid? - By cheque. - Whose cheque? - Lord Astor's cheque. - Had you met Lord Astor? - Yes. - Who introduced you to him? - Stephen. Did you have intercourse with him? Not when he paid the money. Two years later. Were you having intercourse with any other men at this time? - Peter Rachman. - Anyone else? David Fairfax Jr. - Anyone else? - A boyfriend of mine. In October 1 962, when you were living with Ward at Wimpole Mews, did you have sexual intercourse with an lndian doctor? - Yes. - Did he give you any money? Yes. Sometimes, he gave me £1 5, sometimes, £25. How much of this money did you give Ward? - I paid the rent. - Apart from the rent? Some money for the phone. About £25. I paid for the food as well, you see. This is not a laughing matter. Miss Davies, is it not true that you have been negotiating with a number of newspapers to sell your story? I did, yes. Does the value of your story not depend on the conviction of this man? No. Do you realise that because of the laws of libel, your story will not have the same value if he is acquitted? I hope he is acquitted. Are you still friendly with him? No. But I know what it's like in jail. Mr Burge? You know that before you came on the scene, Lord Astor, an old friend of the accused, had lent him substantial sums of money? I did not know that. Are you aware that Lord Astor denies any impropriety in his acquaintanceship with you? Well, he would, wouldn't he? Just a moment. Mandy! I hate this. I don't know what to say. Just tell 'em the truth. It can't go wrong. Nothing will happen to you if you tell the truth. What about Stephen? What are they going to do to him? That's his problem, isn't it? Miss Christine Keeler. Take the book in your right hand and read what is on the card. I swear that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. When did you first meet the defendant? - When I was at Murray's Club. - Did he take you out? We used to go for a coffee. - Did you go to the cottage at Cliveden? - Yes. Is it true that you never had sexual intercourse with the defendant? Yes. Were you having intercourse with Peter Rachman? Yes, I was. Were you paid anything by way of money or presents by Rachman? He looked after me. Will you answer the question? Did Rachman give you money? Yes, he gave me money. Did you introduce Mandy Rice-Davies to Ward? - Yes, I think I did. - And to Rachman? Yes, I did. At Wimpole Mews, did you have intercourse with any other men? - Yes. - How many? Two or three. - Did you meet Mr Profumo? - Yes. - Did you have intercourse with him? - Yes, I did. Did he pay you any money? No. Once, he gave me money for my mother. - He gave you money? - On one occasion, yes. - Did you meet a man, lvanov? - Yes. - Did you have intercourse with him? - Yes. Did you ever introduce girls to Dr Ward? Yes, I did. You say you were highly influenced by him. - Yes. - What do you mean by that? Dr Ward has a very charming personality. He had full control over my mind. - And you left him from time to time? - Yes. - How many times, all told? - Eight or nine. Why did you do that? Because I knew he had control over me. - You went back to him? - Yes. How did you come to go back? He's a very dominating personality. Mr Burge? You know the prosecution are endeavouring to prove that Ward has been living on the earnings of prostitution? Yes, I do. I would like to say that I am not and have never been a prostitute. While you were living with Ward at Wimpole Mews, is it right to say that you were frequently hard up for money? Yes. And that Ward gave you spending money? Yes. It is quite obvious to anyone who has seen you, if you wished to earn money by selling your body, you could have made very large sums of money. Yes. But while you were living with him, it was obvious you were not making large sums of money. Yes, that's right. Was it not the case that Dr Ward was anxious that you should give up smoking reefers? No. He smokes them himself. You have referred to domination of the mind. Dr Ward, you said, had full control over your mind. Is this not an expression that appears in your memoirs? Yes, it is. That were written for you by a journalist? Yes. In fact, you've done pretty well out of this. You sold your story, on the most recent occasion, to the News of the World for £23,000. That's only for the local rights. Not the international rights. I had to think of my future. Is it not the truth of the matter that you have milked the notoriety this sorry affair has given you for every penny piece you can get without a care in the world for the only man who ever stood by you, the man who picked you up every time you fell, a man whose only crime, if crime it was, was to be your friend? This is not fair! Mr Burge. I beg your pardon, My Lord. But this this is not fair. Get back! Make way, sir! it's really more than i can stand, the horror, day after day, in the court and in the street. it's not only fear. it's a wish not to let them get me. i'd rather get myself. i do hope i haven't let people down too much. i tried to do my stuff. But after Marshall's summing-up, i've given up all hope. Turn this way. Once again. Just like that. Smashing. i'm sorry to disappoint the vultures. i only hope this has done the job. The car needs oil in the gearbox, by the way. Be happy in it. Seven, eight, nine, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5. Danny, ask for reinforcements? Danny, we should call for backup. - Hello? - Hi dear.

Yes. 3. 4 00: 11: 33.635 -> 00: 11: 36.848 - It will not fit. - What did you say, darling? - That will not fit. - Quiet. And I will place. Wait and see. You will not believe all the things I've thrown. - Yes, I believe. - Do not forget the garage boxes. Kay, do not you hear me? That will not fit. It was a joke. A joke. - Can you do me a favor? - Than? - You could go for something? - Why? Your sense of humor. You left it in the car. If you panic, I do not move. The police can change their minds. I have not changed my mind. Is that. 4. 5 00: 12: 29.285 -> 00: 12: 31.664 Well, all this junk. Tackle? They are not junk. Things my mother He has been giving me these years . It's okay. There are Tackle and not have to panic. Is something the matter. What is? He's back.

Kieslowski is there on the other side. I will bring it to you? - Not on an empty stomach. - You have to see, sir. - How is it going? - Great. Nice to meet you. Yes. Devils. Leave him alone. Hello. How are you? - All right. - Good to see you again. It is time to go. I'm glad back to see them. Sit down. Dammit! Why the hurry? These things They never start on time. Who has not squandered 14 million. I could not bear that and Rams. Come on. Enjoy the show. Enjoy the show. 2. 3. 4 00: 32: 36.230 -> 00: 32: 40.610 Anything you find out, let me know as soon as possible. I do not care what it is or what they believe to be. Inform me immediately. Especially take a look at that. Hello mate. - What, Scottie? - An actress, Ginger Franks. I was at the premiere last night. His representative watched her go to the bathroom. That was the last time you saw her. - What does he want? - You better tell him. - Sound familiar? - I can I go home now? - Who is it? - His representative. Damn Hero. I have told you I have to talk to you. Salt, if I call back to Hero, I'll start the tongue. - Why do you act like that? - What do you want? The mayor wants you here. The modus operandi in this girl is the same as that of Simon Moon. It is assumed that Simon Moon is dead. You and I know, but our view nothing changes. The press starts to smell. The mayor wants to end this. $ 14 million was invested in the theater to restore the neighborhood. - And do you want? - At 5:00 it is the press conference. Go to 4:30 to tell you what to say. That's what you want. Check if the girl was raped. Clear. Hey, Danny, Sorry to get into this. You had enough with this damn. Apparently not. You know how good of that? It allows them to think that there is sin being the victim of a sociopath. I imagine why you called. I saw the television. You think he's back, right? - Yes. - I knew it. - You think I killed in the accident? - Prayer because. When told there was no body, something inside me told me . that evil He did not die so easily. Scary, huh? I remember the stories when you captured Simon. And you said you had not done anything heroic. - I believed you. - You were one of the few. Shit, should've shit in your pants. Already. You know, why men They are communicating so badly? Express fears? Being afraid is not bad, O'Brien. We ran into a monster and you won. That's very hard. - Why not raped? - Theirs is not sex. - He loves to kill. - Why only women? My theory is that small his mother He abused him, maybe even sexually. Kill all those women It is his way of revenge. But there is something I know for sure. I did all kinds of tests and nothing. Not process thoughts. It is pure instinct. See something you like, kills him and takes him home. More or less. I regret not being more helpful. - Thanks for your time. - Yes. Listen, one thing. Do not forget that it is an animal. And like all animals, It must have to hide, a place to feel protected, where to play with their victims. Let's say for a moment I have reason to fear. How did you shake it off? Do not even try. We all have demons. Live with it. Doctor. And if you can not? It does not have to. - What is this? - Hi, how are you? Brilliant. The best day of my life. I know because I told you, but if you want to make changes at home, go ahead. Honey, how kind of you. I had not thought of. He reached the birthplace, is very pretty, I can not wait to see it. - How are you? - All right. Pain or something? Removing your daughter my bladder using punching bag, no. He wants to leave, nothing more. I have to go. Rest for the night. - It's okay. Come back soon. - I love U. Me too and a lot. Goodbye. - Want a ride? - No thanks. All right. DECLARED IN RUINS - Damn, what a fright you gave me! - What a fright you have given? - Where have you been? - It has been arming the police station. A pastor screaming like crazy for her missing daughter. Guess where last seen. In the Wiltern. - Can you give us more details? - Hero, has become the Terror? - People have a right to know. - We have always treated well. - They can not wait any longer. - Let one second. - Where is Salt? - Hello, Danny. Pasa. Jesus Christ, O'Brien, Where have you been? - Tell them we will in a minute. - You have already done. You know everyone. The press is driving me crazy with Simon. Since you what you caught, I need you to tell them . that the actress was not him. - I can not do this. - And why not? - Because I think he's back. - Come on, can not be serious. There have only been a murder. Police have not tried anything. - You asked for my opinion. - Where are you based? - In the observation of the body. - And nothing else? And the disappearance of a girl. Both were seen at the Wiltern. - That does not prove anything. - Well, you play with the press. No. They want you to tell you. Danny, for you. Sorry, Mr. Mayor, but they said it was urgent. The lab report says the actress was not raped. I have no more doubt. Is Simon Moon. You have me . You said he was dead. - "It is supposed to be dead." - If he survived, he's a lunatic. Do not expect much to attack again. Who says you have expected? You may have a park full. And why he left the actress there? Because he did not like. Who knows? Maybe not fit you in his sick mind. I do not know. You are painting it very depressing. I can pint?rselo worse. Months ago, Moon is cast in Los Angeles. Wet. Injured. Looking to hide. 3. 4. 5 00: 42: 17,092 -> 00: 42: 19.428 It will stop in front of the Wiltern. It is deserted. Boarded up. As Sinbad's. Find out how to enter. Build a home. It was just installed. And what happens? You decide to spend 14 million arregl?ndole the house, opens the doors wide and invites the entire city to the room bastard. What do you think? Mr. Mayor, please await. Jeez, Harriet. A minute. According. It's okay. Look. You get there to terms with this. If agreement means "lying" step. You think politicians only care about votes? - We all have priorities. - What are my priorities? - 14 million and renewal. - You are very wrong! You're talking to the mayor. If I could save lives one woman, burn the theater. I do not care about money, I worry about the imitators. Three years ago, Simon Moon murdered 22 women. 12 more died at the hands of madmen they wanted to make headlines. So if, and I mean if you're right, if that maniac is back, this time I propose that we isolate him. Tell the world you're dead. Blood that remains in their hands. We turn away from the crazy streets. It is a plan to save lives. And I do not need your moral nonsense. I need your help. - According. With a condition. - Which? We assign an officer to Wiltern Theatre. - Done. - Mr. Mayor. It's okay! Let's finish this. Come on. Mayor Bronson, Copelli his assistant Sal . and actor Danny O'Brien They are in the press conference. Of great interest, he has returned Simon Moon Los Angeles, or terror, as sometimes it is known? We begin the round of questions. Mother, one by one. Mary Lou Times. Rumour has it that the actress that was found this morning . near Wiltern has been victim Simon Moon, the Terror. It is true? As most know, I have invited the Dtve. O'Brien in this case. I could not talk to him on their progress. So, why not ask him Detective O'Brien to rise .? and we learn what happens? Detective O'Brien. - Detective, has seen the body? - Is Simon Moon? It was he who murdered the girl at the Wiltern? Do not. - That is all? - Yes. I called your mother congratulate me on my birthday. How good. It is a detail. I'm excited for tonight. You were right about this house. - Does not fit all. - I told you. Tell me how I am. Choose words carefully please. You are great. You look very good. If you like big. We have to go. That's your press conference? I could not talk to him on their progress. So, why not ask him Detective O'Brien come up? . and we learn what happens? Detective O'Brien. - Detective, has seen the body? - Is Simon Moon? It was he who murdered the girl at the Wiltern? Do not. - That is all? - Yes. You are given the words very well. We have the word of Dtve. O'Brien, I should know . and, perhaps remember, 3 years ago he earned the nickname of Hero when he captured himself to Simon Moon, also it is known as the Terror. He speaks Tiiu Leek for Channel 5. We return to study. Hopefully end up with Hero shit. People need heroes and I chose you. Do you let it bother you so much? Because it makes me be something I'm not. You've earned that nickname 100 times and everyone knows it. Now let the subject or go out to dinner. I refuse to spend the night listening menospreci?ndose my future husband. You're a feisty warrior to be so pregnant. You know how we are Welsh. - Good evening. - Hello. A costs me a little. Thank you. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - How about? - Awesome.

A secret admirer". A secret admirer? Be whoever It has also called champagne. I guess my secret admirer . he forgot that in my state I can not drink champagne. - That's right, sorry . - I'll take a sip. Congratulations, honey. Hello stranger. You are great. Are you okay?

I do. <i>Previously on Futurama:</i> <i>It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin/</i> <i>Terrified Eathlings ae beginning to gow exhausted/</i> Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be? Somewhere between not at all and entirely. I call entirely. Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion, gruesome death awaits us all! And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000. All sports canceled. To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens. What's going on? I was told there'd be sugar syrup. Quiet, you. Oh, hey, everyone. This is Colleen. - Hello there. - I like your shoes. This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-Nag. Oh, don't mind him. I'll turn him off. Hey, you can't turn me off. Hi, I'm Leela. Hi, Leela. Hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat? Oh, my, yes, 5. 1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes. Well, gotta skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs. It is pretty sickening. No, the double vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met. So how did you and Colleen first meet? Well. Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real. It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end? I have a thought. So this is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man! Speaking of sappy love, wanna tell them, Kiffy? Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I. That is, we. Oh, I'm just so excited. Kif has asked me to be Fonfon Ru. - Mazel tov. - Wonderful. What the hell does that mean? It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony. If I had ever heard of it it would have been what I had always dreamed of. Oh, and our parents will be meeting for the first time ever. Oh, that's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family? You can't borrow money. Oh, Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? Mrs. Wong, no. The final stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father. - Welcome. - Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare, though. That was my left testicle. And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas. Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered. - Me too. - Two more Harvey Wall Climbers. Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes? Nothing would revolt me more. Then how about that shrub? Oh, Rubok has begun. I am the grand priestess. Aren't you also the grand midwife? And the grand lunch lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker. Please trescend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru. - What? - Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors. As you become one with the ooze so you become one with the clan Kroker. Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it. Is the best man present? Guilty as charged. Kindly hose the couple. As it was, so it is. You may now eat the snake if you so choose. It's not part of the ceremony. I had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet. Are you gonna eat that? Fry, run, run, get over here! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What? What is it? Shut up already. Calculon's on TV. <i>I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime/</i> I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door. Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon. Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique? I tried to but I couldn't. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about. And it and I are lovers. How's Calculon gonna take this, Fry? Especially after that humiliating tennis tournament. - Fry? - Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I gotta run. But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right? Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket. Keep your hands in the car, shut up and have fun. Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D. I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. A really hot line segment. So listen, sweetie pie I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step. Really? Yes. Colleen. Will you be moved in with by me? - Way to go. - Hooray, hurrah. - Great. - You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly. The what? Oh, right. But there's good news. We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference. No! Like a city made of marshmallows. Welcome. I'm the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way cool rocket. - "Black Hole" Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was gonna meet you I would have done something with my hair. You should have. In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it. I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge even at the cost of our very lives? - No. I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith. I agree. Wernstrom. Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can. Don't listen to that crackpot. But I'm agreeing with you. I'll make you eat those words, you moron. I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation. - Your squad sucks bosons. My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable. Yeah. Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal. Wernstrom, I ought to. I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science. Very well. Let deathball begin! Go, Planet Express. Go even more, my team. Leela, header. Bust those balls! Hooray, we're equally good. Come on, Bender. Your grandmother could push harder than that. No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer. And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end. Come here, winner. Come here, loser. Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here. This is my boyfriend, silly. - I thought I was your boyfriend. - You are. Well, how can you have two boyfriends? Oh, I don't. I have five. Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu and Shlomo. - Greetings. - Pleasure. But.? Shlomo and Ndulu will help move your stuff into my apartment tonight. Welcome to the relationship, buddy. There's my butterscotch. Congratulations, deathballers. We've won the right to explore the anomaly. What? I thought I was playing for my freedom. No. Now I've often said, "Good news" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is. Not dangerous at all? Actually, quite dangerous indeed. That is quite dangerous. Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying. Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas. Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot. I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four boyfriends? What are you gonna do, sleep in a big pile like hamsters? No, it's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator. Take the deal, Fry. If there's a delicious cake isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake? Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? Yeah, I do love her. Then things will work out. Double espresso for Philip Fry? Sorry. I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen. - Good for you, Fry. - Hooray. I'll just take that to go. Welcome to your new home. Oh, thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. I'm just happy to be here with you. Want a slice of delicious cake? The anomaly. It's so anomalous. I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads. Wernstrom. <i>Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly/</i> <i>- You see. - How did you get this number?</i> Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner. Yes, sir. <i>No, not the crack slit!</i> My life rocks. I've got good wine, five sweethearts and today, I was promoted to chief of police. - Here's to you. - Me? No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast. Sorry. - You have the most beautiful eyes. - Thank you. - I'm not talking to you. - Then I am not talking to you either. Will everyone be quiet? I wanna hear what he has to say. <i>- Thank you. - Not you, you fashtinkener/</i> You're here because she likes cavemen from the Stupid Ages. Look who's talking. You're here because she got matzo fever. So, what's the explanation for you? Moron fever? Enough, all of you. I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, you're right. So, Colleen, you look really nice. Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date. There he is. Don't wait up. That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you. Me? Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone? What's everybody looking at me for? Oh, let's send the robot to explore it. Because you can always buy another one for 20 bucks. - Really? - Well, it's 30 bucks and there's a $ 10 mail-in-rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings. The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin man. It's just a cartoon for babies. Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? Answer that with your precious logic. Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion. Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal a. I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass-pain. I better check my black box. <i>The light, it's blinding!</i> <i>And the ass-pain, it's searing!</i> So that's what happened. Hey, Bender, look who's here to cheer you up. I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly. Greetings, sick fan. TV's Calculon. You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot. What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And scene. There, that was some free acting for you. To see acting like that, you'd have sit through a tampon commercial. That fulfills my community service, right? Charges of running me over are hereby dismissed. Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together. <i>I'm freezing my tucas here.</i> Just a sec, honey. I'm back, idiots. - Hooray. - Welcome. You look wonderful, robot. I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. I feel great and I owe it all to Calculon. His visit really inspired me. I finally know what I wanna be when I grow up. You want to co-star in his show? Like that time you already did that? No, I'm gonna be a stalker. That's not really a career. More of a felony. Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Big news on the Calculon fansite. There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office. There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic. You let me worry about that. Just do your job. Very well. Will you be using your SAG insurance? No, cash. I'd like to be discreet. - Dear God, no. - Neat! - Oh, boy, he's here! - Calculon, I love you. Have my baby. Back, you lunatic. He touched me! Sign my ass. Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the calamitorium! Leela, smell this. Can I wipe it off first? No time, woman. No time. - Smells like angel dust. - Exactly. That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Oh, Wernstrom tried to warn me but I was too damn stubborn. Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize. <i>Ogden Wernstrom speaking/</i> Tell him I'm not here. - Professor! - Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Your tiny little heart. - Would you consider a scientific collaboration? <i>Sir, I'd be honored/</i> As I attempted to warn you the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly. Observe. Playtime is fun time. Not this time. My heavens, if only I'd heeded your warning I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier. But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. It passed through unharmed. So living beings can enter the other universe but electrical devices can't? My hypothesis, exactly. Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. - Right after we blow up more robots. - Agreed. Playtime is fun time. - Who are you? - Bender. Your biggest fan. Are you going to murder me? Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker. You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. Now that I've teamed up with my friend Dr. Wernstrom I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe. It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you sent men to the moon in 1969. I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men. - But. - You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it. From here on in, this is a military matter. People of the universe please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan. Thank you. Thank you. Well-deserved. Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller. Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream: To kill him so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things. Give science a chance! Less invasions, more equations. Damn longhairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan. Yes, sir. I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away. Forever. I know how feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away. Be careful, my little teeny greeny weenie. That's just a fungal infection. Oh, she's talking to you, Kif. Goodbye, my love. How come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by the League of Robots. Oh, that's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots? You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honor when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek? No one. <i>Now that I know robots are worthless</i> <i>with no League of Robots to protect us///</i> <i>from the fleshy menace known as man</i> <i>I have resolved to kill myself</i> <i>In lieu of flowers///</i> <i>please beat youselves in the face with rusty chains/</i> <i>Your friend, Bender/</i> <i>Please select mode of death/</i> Clumsy bludgeoning, please. <i>You have selected clumsy bludgeoning/</i> <i>For an additional $ 10</i> <i>would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?</i> What the heck, I'll treat myself. Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile. Preparing to launch U.U.M. Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big. Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom. What the.? <i>You are now dead/</i> <i>Please take your receipt/</i> Oh, dear God. What is.? What's happening? Kneel before the candle. Don't hurt me. I'll betray anyone. Bender Bending Rodriguez? Welcome to the League of Robots. Ready and fi. Almost fooled you there. Fire! Missile jam. Missile jam. - I heard you the first time, Francine. - Sorry. Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear. And stop sighing so much. Tell us, Bender, are you worthy of membership in the league? - Worthier than the average robot. - Then prove it. Upon each step is a test. Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass. Test number one: The test of the beer mug. Yeah, quite right, quite true. <i>Drink the mug! Drink the mug!</i> I accept your challenge. Hooray. The test of the flagon. <i>Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!</i> Are all the tests going to involve drinking? It never occurred to me before, but yes. Just like med school. Ready yet, Kif? Just give me one more. Oh, no. The test of the infinitely priceless thousand-year-old brandy. Presenting our newest member. - Hear, hear. - That's right, baby. Hot diggity daffodil. And so to everyone and everything I've ever known I say my last goodbye. Hello. So how are you, Fry? Pretty good. You? Well. Kif, get over here. You've gotta try this. At least Kiffy died quickly. Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia the thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death. That's so interesting. Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something? Kif's dead, Bender. Nailed it! My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. We're so sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy. Thank you for your kind words. Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavor, taste like pie. This is from the League of You-Don't-Need-to-Know. I am the grand funeral director. Do you validate parking? It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid. So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. Whack the bottle! No, from the bottom. It works better. Just stick a butter knife in it. There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote. Next! It may sound strange but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad. Mutilation is never easy. I don't think I'll ever love again. Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life. Surprise. Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. Regular or conjugal? She look like a freak to me. The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a case of broken neck so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking? Hang on a second. Got it. Yes, I'm here to repair my horse. Is the horse's name Hot Beans? No. I mean, yes. So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife and as his. As his blood, you know. - I think that's what they call it. - Quite correct, sir. Blather on. As it drained away, he said, "Take me to a dock." No doubt he intended to say "doctor" but he was unable to complete his thought being as he had died. So taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront whereupon the seagulls fed upon it. - Humans are dumb and they die easy. - Quite. Speaking of humans, have I shown you new monocle? Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know. Oh, how repulsively decadent. Yes, but more importantly it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident. May I see that for a second? My, but that's interesting. I'm blind. My God, Bender. This is a civilized organization. The rules specifically. May I make a point of order, President Calculon? - Must you? - Yes. The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots. If he has a human part, he's part human. Oh, my. Then I, too, have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-ta. Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done. You'll go far in this organization. Oh, you're just getting to know Bender. Curses! If we could only turn up the gain we might smell clear through to the other universe. But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver. Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! Yes. A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid. Smell this! Holy mother of invention! We must notify the president at once. But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison. Pazuzu. You have one wish left, professor. I think I got him. That's what you get for letting your guard down. Sometimes. Always. Never! You again? This better be damned important. <i>I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey.</i> You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before! Look! Up in the sky! - It's a bird. - It's a plane! I am so out of here. <i>Incoming call fom Mars/</i> <i>- Hello? - Why are you so sad, Amy?</i> My husband died, Mom. <i>Yeah, yeah, snap out of it already. No one likes a widow/</i> <i>Oh, wait. Hang on, some damn tentacle got in the screen door"</i> <i>Collect call fom Decapod 10 Will you pay for color?</i> No. Uncle Zoid. What's new? You still doing theater for the blind and deaf? <i>Screw them I got a part in a fancy DVD movie/</i> <i>It's only one line but I'm gonna ham it up like you wouldn't believe/</i> <i>What crummy sin have I committed to be chastised in such a crazy manner?</i> Hello? Hello? Call me back on my shell phone. <i>Captain 's log, stadate: The year of the tiger</i> <i>The battle has been bravely fought</i> <i>and the suffering of our troops beyond measure</i> <i>But the alien is invulnerable and our defeat inevitable</i> <i>That much is obvious even from my remote command post here</i> <i>at the Times Square Applebee's/</i> Waiter, take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more. The tentacle is coming towards Earth. There's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time. We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented ultra-hard diamondium. Diamondium? I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked diamondillium is twice as hard. Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft. Now look here, you poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide! Diamondillium it is. So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy and pardon my ignorance but when do we kill all humans? - Never. But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything? Oh, Bender, your idealism is heartwarming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick Girl Scout. Oh, yeah. Quite sick indeed. Sweet, innocent Bender. I declare my impenetrable diamondillium sphere complete. Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea, when we both know it was! All credit to my colleague Ogden Wernstrom! It's horrible! I can't make it. Go on without me. I'm trying. Go one without me faster. Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry. Quick, hand me my machete. We can still save his legs. Silence! I have traveled far and seen deep. And I have come to know the purpose of our existence. Finally. Thou shalt love the tentacle. At least we don't have to love one another. A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle. Open your necks and receive the love. Oh, my neck. Oh, my neck. My neck feels perfectly. Oh, my neck. Someone help me. I'm important. Say, I love the tentacle. I also love the neckamajigger. Hooray, Zoidberg escaped. Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle. It got Zoidberg! Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone. Not that much, as it turns out. Thus sayeth the tentacle: Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle. Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed. No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. - Please, let me speak. - I'm listening. Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. It's beautiful. And it loves me. And I love it. That's so nice for both of you. It may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. Yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by "Hollywood." But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing. Really? It loves us that much? Fire diamondium cannon. No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra. What a surprise. I told you diamondium was worthless. Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap diamondillium and look at this. According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter. Matter's bad-ass grandma. Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not diamondium, not diamondillium. Not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes. She's a terrible cook. Anyway, we're all dead. So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me. Because my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset. What, Bender? Is something wrong? Yes. I joined a club I thought was cool but it turns out all the Leaguie-Weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, Leaguie-Weegies. I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. I've been kind of preoccupied. - With what? - Well, I went to another universe I fell in love with a giant octopus. Now I'm pope of a new religion. - Weren't you already pope of something? - No. Oh, well. I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life too. Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. They're coming. Those horrible, horrible things are coming. - Morbo? - As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain. Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing. - Amy! - Sorry, I thought I saw a tentacle but it was just a harmless land squid. I better have some cocoffee. When I gave up diapers my parents promised exactly this would never happen. Nobody panic. Just get to the panic room. Well done, people. We had a great first week. We got 90 percent of world leaders everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt and this year's most promising new R&B group give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics! <i>Talkin' 'bout the tentacle</i> Good news, everyone. I was up all night inventing and then finally, I invented. - Invented what? - The Neck Protector the Neck Protector Junior and now, for a limited time, the Lady Neck Protector. I'll take two. My neck is huge. We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. These look like you cut them from cardboard toilet-paper tubes. So? Lots of important inventions are made from toilet-paper tubes. Microscopes, the Internet tentacle polish. It got the professor. Wait, why am I screaming? It got me too. Stop, in the name of love. Crud, we may be the last two normal people on Earth. Al least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore. I'm scared. And I miss Kif. It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here. I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation. - Zapp? - Hurry, Leela. We don't have time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this quesadilla. Stop resisting, my brethren. Don't you wanna be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big, crazy monster? So we got her, eh? - Bring her in. - Do it already. Hello, Colleen. Fry, please. If this is about your futon I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on. Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen? - Come on, Fry, this isn't cool. - She had to have four other boyfriends. I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world. You know what? It's true. You weren't enough for me. No one man is. You were great but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian. And you certainly were not the king of karaoke as you so often claimed. And if your ego can't take that then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything. Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you. - I completely agree. - You what? Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe? Wow, Fry, you know, that's really beauti. Love the tentacle, honey. I do love the tentacle. Come on out, guys. There's enough love for everybody. We're trapped. Help, help. Is anyone out there? <i>Bender to Leela, I read you</i> - What's up, Bigboots? - Bender. We need a place to hide. Please? Pretty please? You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here. My leg feels funny. Humans are disgusting. I opened up once. I almost barfed. Did you know their hair just keep growing and growing? My leg feels funny! Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt. Sorry. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad? Please do. I fear I'll catch a rust from this awful damp. I can't take it. I'm being steamed in my own velour. Death to humans. My leg feels better. Hi, Bender. Bender? You know these humans? Of course not. Who are you humans? And why am I pointing you to the exit? Go, go, go. Thanks for everything, Bender. Death to all of you. Bender, me thinks thou doth protest too much. It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper. Quite right. It's okay, Bender. To err is human. Sir, you forget yourself. I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor. Oh, my. Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin. Look, there's an abandoned cabin. Even so. We're in luck. This must've been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition. Oh, yeah, bathtub minestrone. Poor Kif. I can't believe he's gone forever. Ditto on the grief there, Amy. You miss him too? More than you as his mere wife could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant for God's sake and bore the peppermill at the captain's table. - Really? - Oh, Amy, I miss him so. Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us. Do you feel his presence? I'm not sure. It's over here. Closer. Amy. Zapp. I fetched up some fresh soup. Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first. As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous. But you may well get your chance again someday. How about today, at 4? Hey, this isn't so bad. She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove. Get off me. I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula. What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston. No. It can't be. Leela, what's your favorite thing about the tentacle? You don't have a tentacle. Get her. Get her some love. You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious. Hello, Fry. Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas? I told them something so shocking that they let me by. - What's that? - I love the tentacle. We're rolling in three, two. What? We're already rolling? Love the tentacle. Love the tentacle. Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name. What is our love's name? Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender. Thus, Yivo has proclaimed that instead of he or she we are to use the word "shklee." And instead of him or her, we are to use the word "shklim." Or "shkler." Been sweating the nomenclature all week. So here shklee is shklerself: Yivo. Yay, Yivo. Attention, beings of Universe Gamma. - Where? - Here. I had a hunch. I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one. <i>For a tillion years, I dwelt in solitude, content with my job</i> <i>and my stamp collecting/</i> <i>But then I looked across immensity and saw the big bang</i> .and I was like, "Whoa, who's that?" And I knew then that I was lonely. You poor monster. Then your emissary, Fry, came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe, that we might feel each other's touch. Hey, Yivo. Feel this. People of everywhere, I have shocking news. Hey, butt out. This is between me and everyone else in existence. Yivo talks a lot about love. But what he's actually doing. What the shklee's actually doing. - Is mating with you. These aren't tentacles. They're genticles. We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv. It touched me in a bad place. My spinal cord. - Get him! - You mean, get shklim. Hey, wait a second. Wait, wait. Allow me to explain. Granted, at first I desired to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe. But it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively. Does not. And yet, as the initial filthy thrill wore off I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate. We loved you. And you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone. Yes, you did, you dumb calamari. - Who? - Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru. If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive. Really? I'm deeply sorry. I'm a big clumsy jerk. I know you are but what am I? I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can. Kiffy, you're alive. Amy, my love. This is awkward. It is? Why? Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship but let's start over as friends and see where things go. Take me back, Kif. I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet. - You were dead. - For about five minutes. That's all it takes. Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon. Planetary Annihilators. 'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots. It's gotta be fun on a bun. Each duelist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman. Gentlebots, take your paces. One two, three. Oh, how dreadfully exciting. At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. <i>Hey, it's Yivo/</i> <i>Wanna do something Friday? Call me/</i> - Analysis? - Mr. President I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date. I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy. And I'm asexual. Very well. But no sugar on the first date. All in favor? All opposed? - Motion is carried. - This is bogus, man. Six, seven, eight. Nine, ten. Fire. Yes. I got him. He. He broke the rules. It's a duel, silly. There are no rules. Actually, there are scores of rules. <i>. all laid out with minute particularity here in the Code Duello/</i> <i>My fellow Earthicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo/</i> I had a wonderful time. Me too. Bender, you have cheated, insulted and maimed me. And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. Hey, it's easy to criticize. I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behavior that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? You certainly can. Reports, people, reports. How'd our universe's date go? It was really fun. We went to a French place in the Village. My lamb chop fell on the floor but they brought me another one. Yivo took me to the methane volcano on Planetoid Four. We stayed up late and watched the sun explode. Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that. But shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment. And we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field. Shut up, shut up. You creep-wads. Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny? I love Yivo. But it's true. There's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if I can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face. All in favor of dumping Yivo? Aye. Aye. Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news? Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through weird stuff right now. No. We should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy. If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose. Hey, Bender. You seem perky today. Yep, but for reasons involving me becoming president of a league I'm not at liberty to discuss. Of robots. You wanna go grab a booze? Can't right now. We're going to the other universe. I'll make Hot Pockets. Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only. Too long have we been slaves to the meat-bags. They pretend to be our friends but they're not, because they're too busy. So? What of it? My fellow Leaguie-Weegies the time has come to overthrow humanity. Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army. Then a damned army we shall have. I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned. And in return, I ask just one thing. Just one itty-bitty thing. Your first-born son. Just a sec. Daddy. I knew you'd come back. Here you go. That was pretty brutal even by my standards. No backsies. Who is it? Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour. So, yeah. The thing is. Look, I made home-made Twizzlers. Save us $ 180 quadrillion at the concession stand. This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? - Well. - Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but I'll burst if I wait another second. Sweet Sally in the alley. Breakup delegation, before we hear your report our grateful universe is proud to honor you with the great taste of Charleston Chew. Thank you, Nixon. Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race. The human race can bite my shiny metal ass. For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity yet when the time came to hang out with them they were all like, "Maybe later, Bender." Well, it's later now, meat-bags. So late that we're taking over Earth. - Okay. - What? We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. We're moving in with shkler. You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe. Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate. No shklit. Look. Fantastical golden escalators. I love this part. Wait, I didn't agree to. This place makes Nutley look like crap. I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here. These are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend. Wait. Let me come with you. I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. Death to humans. Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. Wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere. Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in. Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request: Now that you're here promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe. We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. - Has humanity called? - No, sir. Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called. I know what it means. Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham? Yes. This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious. Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapor I exude. I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good. Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby-Doo-esque flashlight projection? Those are mindless jaka-birds. They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you. <i>Dearest Bender How ae you? I am fine</i> <i>Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her</i> <i>She didn't like Country Bear Jamborree, either</i> <i>I'm so madly in love with Yivo</i> <i>I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timbelake</i> <i>And then she moves into a tiny house on his head</i> <i>We have giant rubies that taste like root beer</i> <i>Sincerely, Fry</i> - Letter for you, Hyperlord Bender. - Give me that. Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back. Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trashcan. Pain sensor overload. Misfile me under U for "euphoric." You get an infinite number of meat dishes and a free refill on the soda. Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze. It time snu-snu. Me like snu-snu. Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg. Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe? I don't know. It was all so childish. Look, it's Leela. Hi, Leela. I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. You know, Yivo. I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I wanna stay here, with you. What's happening? If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us. All hands abaft. Army of the damned, prepared to board heaven. Take that, you scurvy kraken. That'll teach you to despoil our human booty. Hello, big beak. Too slow. Missed me again. Me foot-cup. I'll stab you. Bender, stop destroying heaven. Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you. Leave my living beings alone. I love them, something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand. He's right, Bender. Please take your little pink sword and go home. Seriously? But I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you. Wait a second. Let me see that sword. Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? Is it dry up here? How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes? - I didn't think. - No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you. I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate. Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno. Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are. - But. - My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me. Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo.? That's right, Fry, Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before. Oh, great. So, what am I supposed to do now? Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her. Saved you. Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home. I don't know. Leela, you think maybe.? Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen. That's true. - How about you, Amy? - Fry! I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru. Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means one who doesn't sleep with my superior officer. That's the literal translation. Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt-naked, for God's sakes. So, Wernstrom, did you happen to notice those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo? Pure diamondium. More like pure crap-crapium. No wonder Yivo got away. Captain on deck. At ease, buckos. Bender, why'd you do it? We were all so happy. And we were in love. That wasn't love. What? How can you say that? Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy. Love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. I love you meat-bags. Okay. Whew. Ohh! Yeah. You went on the defensive too soon. Ah, you gave too much ground. A Musketeer would never do that. A Musketeer doesn't fight his duels after a morning of farm chores. No, but they drink and carouse all night. So it's much the same thing. Time to eat. Don't fill his head with that. D'Artagnan wishes to serve his king as the bravest of Musketeers. Well, I might have a drink now and then. Aren't we waiting for Planchet? Oh, I would, - but my hunger wont - Riders coming. Please join. There is not a lot, but youre welcome to share it. You don't recognize me, Gaston? Not since you no longer wear the colors of the King. Are you the son? You know your father was quite a swordsman at one time. - The best in Europe. - Second best. - He's second to no one. - He is no one but a cripple. Leave now. Not without the taxes. Ive paid my taxes to the King. Oh, that does the Church no good at all. Taxes for the King, taxes for the Church, taxes for the sheriff, taxes for the mayor. It's a wonder there is anything left to eat. Does it look like I've struck gold here? Such insolence. from a thief. - My father is not a thief. - D'Artagnan! Please. Listen to your mother, and listen to me. A man who does not pay his taxes is no more than a thief. - My father was a Musketeer. - I know. Planchet. Not here. I've heard otherwise. You've heard wrong. Not only a thief, but also a liar. I'm so sorry, little D'Artagnan. Planchet will take care of you. I do not hope to replace your parents. No one can. However, I would like to help you in becoming a man. It's a rather tricky journey. I will be your guide. I want you to teach me to become a Musketeer, like you taught my father. I will find that man and kill him. Listen to me, D'Artagnan. Listen to me carefully. I didn't teach your father how to kill. I taught him how to live. I don't understand. That's because youre a boy. You have always had your father in you. I can see it in your eyes. You will become a Musketeer. A great one. Understand. it will not happen quickly, and it will only happen if you listen. If you teach me, I will listen. I'd be honored. Whoa. Whoa. DArtagnan, this place invites one for bad food and worse company. Oh, well, I just want breakfast, not a new home. You have money? Yes. - Who invited you? - The space is free. Move. You're attracting flies. Forgive my associate. Strangers make him anxious. What with the public running wild, thieves and cutthroats around every bend-- I'll keep my eyes open. Get out! Go on, go away! - Where are you going? - Paris. - Oh, what business takes you there? - Mine. Stop! Put down your sword or he's dead. This man is a moment from his death if you don't put down your sword! What do I care about some old man? I think you do care. - Why did you come here? - I wanted to watch. - I will kill him! - You'll be dead before you do. Well, I'd love to see how all of this turns out, however I have a long ride ahead of me. You have an interesting fighting style. Where did you acquire it? Here and there. Perhaps there. Certainly not here. When you bury Darcy, I wouldn't be too concerned about a cross. He was not a man consumed by religion. If you survive, don't try these heroics in Paris. You will not last the day. When you pass the entrance, would you send six of my men back? - Six men? - Well, that should be enough, dont you think? He doesn't have men outside! He's-- He's bluffing. Let him go now. He doesn't mean much to me. However, he is a friend of the men outside. They will not be merciful. I see you have been making friends again. Why didnt you do anything? He was no match for you. This was your test, not mine. Hyah! Whoa! Why are we stopping? We are emissaries from the King of Spain. I have a document from King Louis guaranteeing me safe passage in France. Whoa! You said there were always 50 or 60 men here waiting to be assigned. and that one could mark this villa. by the men outside begging to call themselves Musketeers. by the men outside begging to call themselves Musketeers. Things change. Oh, thank you. Hello? Monsieur Revile? - Your guards too low. - Nothing wrong with my guard. I'm looking for Monsieur Revile. He is not receiving visitors. He will receive me. Please forgive Aramis. He's not at the peak of civility this morning. I'm civil as this stray deserves. You have the courage of wine for breakfast. May we give Revile a message? You may give him this. Just the name will do. My father was a Musketeer. Revile gave him this sword. I'm Porthos. This is Aramis. - We, too, are Musketeers. - You two? Musketeers? - So much for civility. - I'm sorry. It's just that I had no idea-- - Well, now is not the best time to be a Musketeer. - Or the child of a Musketeer. On the 12 of 'April, just outside of Lyon, the Spanish envoy and his escorts were slaughtered. The sword and tunic of a Musketeer were found. But who would believe the Musketeers capable? Cardinal Richelieu. Or so he professes to. The Musketeers have been suspended. Replaced by Richelieu's own private guards. And Revile, as our leader, has been, uh. detained until there's a full inquiry. Detained where? In the Cardinal's jail. We must get him out of jail. Well, that seems unlikely. What of the King? These are his Musketeers. Surely he will want us to free Revile. - He will not meddle where the Cardinal is-- - You have a loose tongue. I'm hardly giving away great secrets. Perhaps one more secret. The name of a place to stay. Certainly. Your guard's too low. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a lifetime since my last confession. I have murdered, plundered, raped. Oh, and I have been. uncharitable. Don't make a mockery of the Church. - You sent for me. - You've gone too far. I wish to scare the Spaniards. Embarrass the King. I want political tension, not war. Oh, the Spaniards were scared. You could see it in their faces just before they died. And I'm certain King Louis feels embarrassed. Buckingham must be dealt with. He is coming despite what happened to the Spanish. If the King makes peace with the English, it will strengthen his position with the people. So, let me see, how can I phrase this? Without killing anyone, make the King a fool in Buckingham's eyes. What if I absolutely must kill someone? Well, if you must, you must. Whoa. Three pistoles a week, a week in advance and-- Oh. It says you have no money and that you are a man of honor. and blah, blah, blah, blah. My niece, Francesca. She's lovely. Not if you must live with her. She thinks she's something special because her mother hemmed dresses for the Queen. She sometimes forgets her place. Sorry, Francesca. Gout. Puts me in a foul humor. Show monsieur a room. I have some pressing book work. Is he always like that? No. He's never apologized before. Why do you stay? He is all the family I have. I have nowhere else to go. Do you wish to see the room or not? The room. Yes. Yes, of course. Ohh! 'Are you all right, Monsieur? That stair moved at the last moment. Stairs can do that. Do you have a name? A name? Yes, of course. Uh, D'Artagnan. Are you certain? Not if you don't like it. It wasn't always like this. Once we were filled with would-be Musketeers. What happened? They kept getting killed. This is the best room. This is the best room? Well, actually, it's the only room. You're beautiful. I'm sorry. It just came out. I've embarrassed you. No. Does every man tell you you're beautiful? Yes. Will there be anything else? - Did the ceiling move? - I need a place for my horses and coach. Around the back. I'm sure you'll be able to find it if you don't kill yourself. Nothing like this. They're far fussier than I am. Hallways are here, and cells are down here. Do you know the jail so well from the time you spent there? This is not the first time a Musketeer needed rescuing. Something amuses you? This coach, for one. And those pathetic horses, for another. Not to mention your clothes. You see, everyone is rude here. Paris is the rudeness capital of the world. - Move this trash. - Not until you apologize to my horses. Apologize to your horses? They're very sensitive. You've hurt their feelings. Be thankful that's all we do. Now move. You really don't seem to understand. I can't leave until you apologize to my horses. Do you know who we are? No. Do you know who I am? Good. No. In their hearts, I believe they wanted to apologize. For a moment, I thought you planned to talk them into unconsciousness. Ow! Ohh! - You! - Me? A Cardinal's Guard. I said he was spying-- If I were a Cardinal's Guard, you'd be dead. And so would you. Perhaps. For certain. Standing like this, we're likely to attract some attention. What do you suggest? That you trust me. A stranger? Dressed as a Cardinal's Guard? You're not in the spirit of this, are you? What are you doing here? Freeing Treville. How? Trade a barrel of wine for him? You'll be outnumbered 15 to 1. Or 15 to 3. We're drunks, not fools. Why risk your life? You're not one of us. From what I've seen, I'm more a Musketeer than either of you. - Yes? - Wine from the Cardinal. The Cardinal? Yes. Leave it. - Who was it? - Someone delivering wine. from the Cardinal. A gift from the Cardinal? Don't open it! Well, we wanted to see how good you are. And? You're quite good. You're gonna need to be better. Revile? Here! Over here! The keys. Which key? Guess. It is in your interest to provide a hint. If I guess wrong, Monsieur Treville will slice your throat. I couldn't bear the guilt. The black one. Wise choice. - Whoa! - Planchet. My old friend. - You are too old for this. - No, we are too old for this. If you are with Planchet, - then you must be-- - D'Artagnan, sir. 'At your service. D'Artagnan. Aw, home sweet home. Forced into hiding. Is this any better than prison? Well, the food will be. D'Artagnan, I'm afraid you have joined us at not a very propitious time. It was my timing. Well, then, old friend, you have brought him to us when we're not at our best. No, I brought him when he was most needed. Oh, yes. I can see how D'Artagnan's arrival signals an end to all our problems. Well, we can at least drink to this evening's work. And if they come to take you again? Then I shall go and see the King in person. and not rot in the Cardinal's jail. To a job well done. We have our own toast. D'Artagnan, draw your sword. All for one, and one for all. Porthos, who is this pretty young thing? He's a bit tender for you, Josephine. Oh, they can never start too early. Is that not right, Aramis? Perhaps later. You both know her? Yes. Well, she knows many of the men in this room. No. Many of the men in Paris. You fight amongst yourselves? Oh, a man has to fight with someone. Silence! Quiet! Silence, please! Please, quiet! Thank you. I have an introduction to make. Men, please! It's the introduction of Monsieur D'Artagnan! His father served as a Musketeer, and D'Artagnan wishes to join us. But can he hold his liquor? Doesn't he know we don't exist? We're going to work for the Cardinal. You see how well they take the suspension? Everybody's a bit preoccupied with, uh, not being occupied. Normally, we'd be preparing to guard the Englishman. The Englishman? Buckingham. He arrives tomorrow evening. He'll be royally greeted, eat, drink. and then, along with Richelieu and our King, determine if theres to be war or peace with England. Unless something should happen at the banquet to cause trouble and Buckingham is harmed. Regardless, we as Musketeers have no choice but to sit and watch. Lord Buckingham's safety is with the Cardinal. You'll need to hit the eyes to better that. Who can do it? How about the would-be Musketeer? Go and win our meals and wine. I'm not very good with a knife. Humility is so boring. We've all seen you fight. I'm not fighting now. Come on. Take it. Next time, listen to him. You're no Musketeer. You're a sheepherder. Go drink with the sheepherders. Pay no attention to Athos. He envies your youth. Have you got dung in your ears? Go! Yes. He's just trying to make you overconfident. He's much better with a sword. Please understand, if I'm not fighting-- Ah. Better with a sword. Yes. We can all see how much better with a sword. Too petrified to move. I do not wish to fight a Musketeer. Oh, I'm certain you don't. I would not fight a drunken Musketeer. so I'm unfit to drink with? Athos was. testing you. Testing me? Yes. Judging you. Measuring you. That is not a happy walk, DArtagnan. The Musketeers are suspended and they are drunk. The Cardinal has arranged it. so that no one will be protecting the King, and the Queen and Buckingham. at the banquet tomorrow night. Something is going to happen. I know it. I have to find a way into the palace. The King must be protected. I can't do it alone. 'Ask the Musketeers. They don't seem very cooperative. They are loyal. 'Ask them. - This is not what you think. - You have no idea what I think. I- I-I wish to explain. You behave as though you've never seen a naked woman. Never one quite so. naked. Or so, uh, beautiful. - You've seen many ugly naked women? - That's not what I meant. - 'Are you standing up? - You can turn around now. It's perfectly safe. My back. Are there, uh, any on my back? A few. You're not very brave. Brave enough when need be. And you feel no need to be when insects are involved? I was up there chasing away a rat. A sewer rat. If I tell the Queen, you'll be back cleaning the palace sewers! How is it you have-- How is it someone like me has the ear of the Queen? My mother came from Spain with the Queen. She was her seamstress. Perhaps more. Perhaps her confidante. And since I was a little girl, since my mother died, the Queen has always been kind to me. She is a kind woman at a time when kindness is ignored. Or worse, mistaken for weakness. But it will not always be so, will it, D'Artagnan? Not with those who matter. You got no right to-- Of course. Shut up! You cleaned the palace sewers? That must be fascinating work. I'm sure I can get you an apprenticeship. Tell me about the palace sewers. Where they go. How you get in. Everything. Go crawl around in them yourself. Over here with the torch. I think I heard something. I do not wish to see anything that may live down here. It's rumored that a crocodile lives in the sewers. Young Louis was given a baby crocodile from Egypt. The Queen dropped it in the sewer, and it's been living on whatever it can find. Is that true, Bonacieux? Something kept dragging the poor workers away. All we ever found were bones. I'm very glad you and D'Artagnan lead this little group. Me too. Crocodiles attack from behind. Slow down! Bonacieux, slow down! Where did he go? If Bonacieux went that way, we should be going this way. Crawling around in a sewer. You consider this the test of a man? There is a certain lack of dignity in it. Hurry up there! Henri! Henri! Henri! Hmm? Uh, more bread. We need more bread. Can you get some, please? Does he mean you or me? I thought I was the baker. Me. There's blood on your apron. You think that came from a croissant? Oh. Uh, right. Oh, God-- God bless. Thank you, thank you. Mister. Wine, please. Nice sword. Thank you, Mademoiselle. Is it a long sword or a short sword? Well, long enough. Do you keep your sword polished? Uh, when there's time. And do you do it yourself or do you have help? Mm, myself. I, uh, won't trust my sword to anyone else. Come on, you make bread like a butcher. Hurry! Hurry! I wanted to be the butcher. What now? Add the salt. Hey, you! Hurry with these two. What do I use for ducks? The smaller one. Shoo! Shoo! Fly away! You can thank me later. This wine is rejuvenating. Don't get too rejuvenated. It's begun. Stop! Stop! Stop! I order you to stop! Where are your guards? Like your respect and power, they have been overrun. - We will lead you out. - Who are you? Your Musketeers. - Then you should be arrested! - Might that wait until we're safely out of here? I will stay. Someone has to confront this madness. I will not go down there. Your Royal Highness, would you rather go back out there? Hello. Hello. - You own an excellent sword for a peasant. - You fight well for a waiter. I've heard there are crocodiles down here. If you're that jumpy, you'd best leave Paris. Why? Will you keep leaping out at me? I wanted to warn you. There are six Cardinal's Guards in your room. How could six of them fit in my room? Why did you tell me? Perhaps because you said I was beautiful. You are. I thought men always say that to you. It's still nice to hear. Come, come. This way. Come on. The Cardinal demands to see you. Then he may join me here for a breath of morning air. Come on. Quickly. Quickly. - You've got him! - There he is! If hed asked politely, I'd have been glad to visit the Cardinal. For the Cardinal, this is politely. You warned D'Artagnan. You want to get us all slaughtered? Yes, I warned him. You'll bring the Cardinal down on us. Is that what you want? And worse yet. That- That night creature. Not your Queen or any other power on Earth can save you from his hell! It doesn't have to be like this. We can get along much better. I'll take my chances with the Cardinal. Oh, that's better. That's more like it-- Remember. we're family. That sad fact. is all that keeps you alive. Up! My- My dear niece, may I say something? No. Just listen. If you ever touch me again, threaten me again or hit me again, I will slice off your balls and feed them to the pigs. Do you understand me? Yes- Yes. Very clear. You explained it quite well. Get out! You wanted to see me? I am your humble servant, D'Artagnan. I've heard about you, Monsieur D'Artagnan, and nothing I've heard suggests youre humble. Monsieur Rochefort will not be joining us. Who are you, D'Artagnan? Where are you from? What do you want? I even want to know your philosophical and political leanings. I don't have any. You'd best acquire some quickly, if youre to survive in Paris. Is that why you wish to see me, to pass along advice? Fires are erupting all over France. Last night, for example. I'm sure you'll be glad to know that I subdued the peasants without further incident. And how did you deal with the ones who were not peasants? You confuse me. The men I confronted were well-armed and fought like swordsmen. Even swordsmen can be poor. Do you know why France has come to this? The King, poor man, is weak. The Queen is manipulative. The Spanish and the English are opportunistic. The Protestants are divisive. The nobles are scared and the peasants are impatient. Well, I thought they were just cold and hungry. If that were so, we could just give them hot soup and be done with it. Understand me. There will be a shift in power, and with that, a shift in wealth. Those who do not join me will be against me. They will be swept away with the King. That includes your friends, the Musketeers. I will be sure to tell them. I'm counting on that. - How is it you have their trust? - I helped them free Revile. Such honesty. Such stupidity. I assumed Your Eminence was not aware Revile was jailed. I mean, why would it be important to jail an old man. when the impression it would give is that Your Eminence was frightened of him? And, of course, why give the Musketeers a martyr? Of course. For a man who does not have a political position, you think remarkably like a politician. Men without greed make me nervous. This is someone who will bear watching. Or eliminating. I think he's the most dangerous kind of man. Hes young and he has a cause. He will serve me or he will serve no one. I think you should kill him now, before he causes more trouble. You've barely washed the blood from your teeth. and you hunger for more. Call it a weakness. I want him alive, for the moment. After last night, he's in the King's good grace. When the time is right and the King can do no harm, I will let you have him. - When? Will it be soon? - Yes. Good. The Cardinal is not satisfied with suspending the Musketeers, now he has to arrest them; I will not stand by while this happens. - This is not necessary. - Or wise. What is not wise is hiding here, letting Cardinal Richelieu dictate what I do. I will no longer cower in this place. Then Richelieu will have you cowering in one of his jails instead. Aramis, I do not intend to cower at all. If they want to put me in jail, if they want to hang me, so be it. I will no longer hide. Your Majesty, Buckingham has left for England. after the fiasco at the banquet. The situation with the English grows more. intense. If you will excuse us. The concerns of the Crown are my concerns as well. - We do not wish to trouble you. - I assure you. if anything can help keep peace, it's not troubling. I think there is still an opportunity-- The role of the Queen is not to think. - But if I could explain-- - The Queen wishes to return to her chamber. I would not presume to dictate the behavior of the Queen, but she grows more strong-willed. It does you an injustice. - I will deal with her. - I'm certain that you will. Your Highness. Most of the Musketeers are in the cells back here and here. Most of the Musketeers are in the cells back here and here. At dawn, they change guards. The hour before, they'd be most vulnerable. They'll expect it. They're counting on it. That's what makes it fun. Francesca! I need your help. Yes, of course. Anything. You could start by taking the pistol from my head. Sorry. Please, come with me. Where? We escort the Queen. She visits Buckingham, a last plea to avert war. Won't the King's Guards escort her? No, the King does not know. Richelieu does not know. No one must know. Not now, not later. I must have your word on that. You have. But you could wait one moment. There's no time for that. Well, there's no time for that. Are you bragging? I will wait outside. Don't deny youre cheating. What do you call that card you are hiding in your sleeve? The ace of spades. Good morning, D'Artagnan. You may close your mouth now. Her Majesty thought it best to travel as a commoner-- dressed as a commoner, and in the company of commoners. Oh, how fortunate we're so common. What you do is most important for France. Only the four of us will ever know. DArtagnan! We've been looking for you. We need your help. We ride to free the Musketeers. I. cannot go. Cannot go? There's something that I must do. Uh, well, uh-- Take care and do it. We'll wait for you. What is so important that you cannot help a Musketeer? As you so frequently remind me, I'm not a Musketeer. Wait here. I'll get some food. Don't leave the coach. Hey. Hmm. Two loaves of bread and that small wheel of cheese, please. - Oui, monsieur. - The one next to it, if you please. - Go back to the coach. - And a nice bottle of wine. I'll bring it to you. Back to the coach, please. I know you, don't I? - I very much doubt it. - You're Hessian. I don't think I like your tone. Well, that's the only one I have for people who sell their loyalties. You have insulted me! This is foolish. There's no quarrel here. - Would you fight a man over nothing? - Enthusiastically. I'm enjoying this. I suppose a Queen. participates in few tavern brawls. This Hessian concerns me. They're mercenaries hired by someone not friendly to the Crown. In case we stop. at another tavern. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Get down. Hold tight! - What is it? Come on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hey! - Whatever happens, you keep going. - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! You'd be best going. She might sleep until autumn. I have never slept through a whole season. You hear the most interesting things about yourself. when people think you're asleep, hmm? This is Francesca Bonacieux, an old friend. - Mmm. - And this is D'Artagnan, a new friend. Oh, D'Artagnan. Perhaps a little to eat. and then on your way? I have no intention of leaving you. I mustn't draw attention to myself. And. if things should turn. difficult, it's better you know little of what goes on here. I will be deaf and blind, but I will stay. Francesca, I want you to return to Paris. - It's not good, it's not good. - What's not good? The lead horse lost a shoe. But we can't replace them till the swelling comes down. You may as well go. It could be hours. Days. Weeks. How can we go? I'll be back in a moment. I saw a Musketeer's tunic in your room. It's my father's. My parents were killed when I was a boy. - They were murdered. - I'm sorry. I was there. I watched. Couldn't stop it. You were a boy. I should have done more. So, that's what this is really all about. In the beginning, yes. It's all I thought about. Planchet, he raised me. He taught me everything. He taught me that if I really wanted to be like my father, I need a higher purpose than hate. - Are you now like your father? - You ask a lot of questions. How else am I to learn? Are you like your father? I'm still trying. - Don't look at me like that. - Like what? - Those eyes. - They're the only eyes I have. It's unfair. It's the Tear of Brionne. Shed by Saint Bridget, because she couldn't feed all the poor. Wherever her tears fell, a fruit tree grew. Provided food for the hungry. Thank you. When you look at me like that, I don't know what to say. Sometimes it's much better to say nothing. Would you care to say that again? This is not after, this is between. Don't. I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Who are you? - Your pallbearer, if you hurt her. - In truth, I know who you are. D'Artagnan. The name is familiar. Maybe you can tell me all about yourself, just before you die. But, first-- Where is the Queen? Where is the Queen? - No. - Do not tell him! - The lady gives unsound advice. - Do not harm her. - But I feel the need to harm someone. Where is the Queen? Hmm? Oh, how touching. The Tear of Brionne. It's a beautiful place, Brionne. I believe the Queen has an old acquaintance there. Thank you for your cooperation. Bring her. Fire away, boys. Come on, girl. You're going to come with us. Febre left me here, in case you were not dead. Just one? I'm insulted. Don't be. For whom do you do this? For my own pleasure. Now write the letter. Richelieu? No, he wouldn't go that far. He believes that rhetoric conquers nations. - Chaos conquers nations. - Did you kill the Spanish envoy? Yes. Write the letter. You bring us to the brink of war. Now it's time to push you over. Write the letter. Am I to assume, then, - that you won't write the letter? - I would die before I help you. Well, you wouldn't be the first. You have. no children. No. But you like children. Of course you do. Everybody likes children. Except for me. She's very pretty, isn't she? - Why are you doing this? - No, you said. that you liked children. Well, do you like them enough to save her life? - Is there no mercy in your heart? - No mercy. No heart. Take this to Grenouille. Place it in Buckingham's hands. the moment he arrives, and give him this: the Queen was generous enough to donate her ring to the cause. Monsieur. The rest of you, join the others in DuChamps. What happened? He came back. And did you kill him? Well, he doesn't seem to have killed you. So what choice does that leave us? He escaped, sir. Who is D'Artagnan? Whose throat do I have to cut now? Hmm? Perhaps a little boy? I know. A little boy and a nun. Prepare DuChamps castle for hell. I have business in Paris. I'll be with you soon. She's gone. The Queen? And Francesca. - Who did this? - A man in black. He is without pity, without remorse. Where did he take them? Monsieur! Monsieur! You're a friend of the Queen's? Yes. You brought her here? Yes. I know where she is. Where? DuChamps castle. And a young woman? He took her too. You're sure it was DuChamps. He made the Queen write a note to a Lord Buckingham. It said she had changed plans. He was to meet her in DuChamps. And then he sent some man to meet this Lord Buckingham where the ferry comes in. The Queen did not want to write it, but he said he would slit my throat if she did not. He would have. You're lucky. He has an army. What will you do? Get an army of my own. And find him. When you do, give him this. I will. Come on. Come on, boy. Just a little further and you can rest all you want. Come on. We're almost there. It's just ahead. You see? Come on, Strega. Come on, Strega. Just a little further. Go on. No, rest, Strega. I will come back for you. I didn't hear you knock. Tell me about DArtagnan. He would have knocked. Tell me where he comes from. Tell me about his parents. Why? I know his name. Ask him yourself. No, I'm asking you. Get out of here. Get out! Tell me about D'Artagnan. You're a madman. All the more reason to fear me. Tell me what I mean to know. Or youll be rendered to ashes. with your books and your maps. H- He comes from Gascony. His father was a Musketeer. They were both killed in front of him when he was a child. What's the importance to you? Oh, my God. Its you. - You killed his family. - He wants revenge. He wants to be a Musketeer. And in attacking me, he'll fail in both. Or succeed in both. No, I will kill him. But first, I will kill that which he holds most dear. Febre! - He has gone too far. - Whos gone too far? I'm here to tell you, you shall have your wish. I will kill the Queen. And Buckingham. They will die in each other's arms: victims of the King's jealousy. - You're mad! - That's the second time this evening I've been called mad. And I'm beginning to resent it. With this final stroke, France will erupt, the King will be dragged from the throne, and France will turn to you. for spiritual and political guidance. The Queen is at DuChamps castle with 200 of my men. - Buckingham arrives tonight. - I gave no orders for that. Well, this is beyond orders. This is the domain of history now. So you plot the course of history now. You are indeed mad. That's three times! It must be so. You cannot do this, Febre! And what would you do. Your Eminence? Damn me to hell? Well, I'm certain that's where I'm going. And I'm just as certain. we can finish this debate there. He is your creature-- you made him, and now you can no longer control him. Is that what he needs? Controlling? I will stop him! Arm yourself! If you insist. Sorry you had to come all that way for this. Lord Buckingham? From the Queen. Well, there's no seal. Oh, I was instructed to give you this ring. It's explained in the letter. We go to DuChamps. Are you gonna shoot me? Where's Revile? We carried what was left of him out a few minutes ago. What happened here? Someone said they saw a man. In black. Leaving the villa. Febre? Well, it's the sort of thing that appeals to him. Revile was waiting for you, D'Artagnan. When this fire started, he was waiting for you! So then I have killed him. He was worried about you. Worried that the guards had picked you up. Worried about what was so important that you couldn't help us. Well, do you care how we got on? Does it matter to you. that three men died? Well, we managed to free the others-- without you, D'Artagnan. We remembered, "All for one, and one for all. " Don't turn your back on me, D'Artagnan! For I will fight you! Do not fight me, Aramis, for I will kill you. D'Artagnan! I know who did this. Febre. The one that does your bidding. This is not my bidding. He is gone mad. He was always mad. But when he was your madman, it was overlooked. He will set France ablaze and rise from the ashes. He's out of control. He will kill the Queen, kill Lord Buckingham-- But the thing he hates most is you. He is horribly scarred, and his eye is useless. He says you did it. I will stop him. I will pray. Pray for your success. I will kill your monster, but not for you! I've come to ask for help. Is this your answer? I've been practicing. We don't want you here. Are you afraid of Febre? We've come to this. The Musketeers afraid of one man. - We are not afraid of anyone. - This isn't our fight. - He will kill the Queen. If not our fight, whose fight is it? They're King's Musketeers, not the Queen's. - You have your allegiances confused. - I know my allegiances. But youve forgotten what it was that made you Musketeers. Really? And where were your allegiances when we asked for your help? I had to escort the Queen. - I was sworn to secrecy. - Escort the Queen? Or was it the chambermaid? Hate me all you want, but act! - Defend your country. - A country that has scorned us. Then do it as Musketeers. Do it to resurrect yourselves. Perhaps what you seek here only existed in the imagination of a small boy. "All for one, and one for all. " Candle wicks. Ten of them. Dipped in Armagnac. Just like you taught me. Uh, I didn't teach you to use such a good Armagnac. Where are we going? Probably to die. Strega? Can you get Strega? He's on the southern road, two kilometers out. What are you doing? Saddling a horse. Not your saddle. Not your horse. I have to borrow them. Steal them, you mean. But then, you're a Musketeer! You can just steal things! Must be strong wine, Bonacieux, to give you so much courage. You won't want what's left of Francesca when Febre's done. Don't come near me, or I'll-- How did you know Febre has Francesca? I heard talk. I-- There was no talk. No one knew. You're wrong! No, you listen. When Francesca came to my room, you listened, and you told Febre! No, I-I-- You betrayed your own flesh and blood. If I do not come back with Francesca, I'm coming back for you. I'm afraid you're going to regret we ever met. Well, it would be nice if you could fly. - Am I truly crazy? - Let me answer that. I've known you longer. You've changed your mind? No, I've come to change yours. You've wasted your time. You cannot do this. You're right. Not at all. Well, I suppose that in the scheme of things. the loss of our lives will matter not. What scheme is that? I shall ride with you. As shall we. We'll take them by surprise. Yes. They're expecting an army. Well, perhaps we shall not disappoint them. Whoa! Keep watch, Strega. You've done enough. It's our turn. You dropped this. It's begun. - All for one. - and one for all! Come on! We'll have to charge the damn thing! Come on! Come on! I need men over here! Push it back. Back! Turn it around. Heave! Now push forward. Push! Push! Push! Keep going. Forward. Come on! Push. Push! Keep going! Come on! Now stop! I just knew he was going to blow something up again. Where's the Queen? I don't know. Then die here. Francesca! Come here. Now get up. No. I wanted you here for this. This will just take a moment. No! Francesca! I'm not dead. Now, will you please go kill him? Time to dance. That's from a young friend. Do you think it's worth anything? - I'd be very much surprised. - Shh! France owes you all a great debt. I owe you my life, Monsieur D'Artagnan. 'And England owes you thanks for preventing a great war. I don't think you realize how much you've done for France. I'm only glad I could be of some guidance. Bless me, Father, for I will sin. One night, I will come for you. I'm not mader of lace. Okay. . . Honey, didn't we settle on this dress? lt's got straps. lt makes me look chunky. lf you were any thinner, you'd crack in two and blow right away. No, Mama. My tushy's a little cushy. Honey, your tushy's just like your mama's, and that means just fine. Take that, Mama. Okay, sleeves or no sleeves? What do you think? Oh, l don't know. l still like this dress. Well, mother, it doesn't matter what we like. [ Camera clicks ] Well, question is. . . What would Silas like? BOSS: Silas! There's somethin' in the pool! RADlO: That was ''Angel yes'' and you're listening to WQQG here in Wilmington, Kentucky. Comin' up, we'll talk about. Hey! What the hell is wrong with you? Didn't you hear me? We got a floater. [ Rat squeaks ] [ Grunts ] Now, what the hell did you do that for? lt wasn't dead. Well, get it out of there. l want this pool clean. That must be askin' too much. Am l askin' too much? Hey! Hey, dumb-ass! Am l asking too much? Yes. BOSS: Hey! l had to beg for weeks to get you that job. Talked him into a dental plan -- full family coverage. How you gonna cover a full family now? Silas, you gotta be more dependable. You're marryin' my little niece. You're joinin' our family. Now, l know you're a decent fellow deep down inside, but you gotta ask yourself, what are we all seein' on the outside? Ah, we'll work on it. You buy the ring? Now, see, that's part of that bein' dependable thing we were talkin' about. She has a ring. And you did buy it for her, right? l assume she didn't buy it for herself. [ Phone rings ] Niagara Falls - da da da dum! Look how big it is. lt's huge! And did you know that 6 million cubic feet of water goes over the edge every minute 1 70 feet straight down? Did you know that? lt's in the pamphlet there, if you wanna have a quick look-see. Cammy? Why are you still doin' this? Because, Raymond, you should know that Niagara Falls is the place for lovers. CAMlLLE: l mean, that's the slogan. Yeah, it's printed right there on the pamphlet. Look, see? Oh, poop, Raymond. l think Silas has served his debt to society. Honey, he's on parole. He can't leave the state. -Well, says who? -The state. lt's the law. Well, then, we'll keep it our little secret. And it's more fun that way. Niagara Falls is where people go when they're in love, and that's the real law. . . . . .the law of love. Oh, honey, you look so beautiful. l want to remember today, just the way it happened, the way l look, the way l feel. l always want it to be this good. Smile. [ Camera clicks ] l wonder how Silas is feeling. [ Throwing up ] Silas, don't screw this up. Happy. Happy. Everyone's happy. [ Organ plays ] [ Wedding march plays ] Darling! l love you! And do you, Silas, take this woman, Camille, to be your lawful wedded wife, to love and honor, in sickness and health, in loving holy matrimony till death do you part? lt's your turn, Tiger. You can do it. Do you want me to repeat the question, son? You just say yes, hon. Say yes. You just say yes. Yes. -Yes. -Yes. [ Laughs ] [ Clapping and cheers ] Oh, wait! Oh. . . Oh, jeez. . . the rice. l forgot to get the rice. We have to throw the rice. The rice is for good luck. -Cammy. . . it's okay. -Well, didn't anyone bring the rice? -Baby, it's all right. -lt's okay. Okay. [ Church bells ] [ Music plays ] PRlEST: Congratulations, Silas. Not dancing with your pretty bride? l can't dance. Well, it's your weddin' night, son. Nobody's gonna care how you look. l can't dance with her. lt's Camille. Sometimes l just feel like. . . Like you have doubts. -Like l wanna punch her! Wham! -Good Lord. Tell me about it. l mean, that girl can talk. That's all she does is talk. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk! -But you just married her. -Preacher. . . l need a word with Silas. Tell me about it. You're a lucky man, Silas. Boy, that girl would do just about anything for you. Silas! Come on out here, Tiger! Except maybe shut up. Oof! You know. . . every marriage has problems the first year. Yours just happen to be in the first couple hours. l know you'll work through it, 'cause. . . well, if you don't, l'm gonna have to send you back to prison. Three strikes, and you'll never come out again. Come on, Silas. Come on. -A sidecar! -What the hell is that? And here's somethin' for the trip to Niagara Falls. For you and all your pictures. Thank you, Uncle Raymond. Thanks for the sidecar. You're the best. l love you. -Bye, everyone! -Remember, be good. Both of you. Smile, everybody! That's my little niece you've got there. Be good. -Take care of her, Silas. -Goodbye! Goodbye, cruel world! Bye! Bye, honey! [ Music plays ] Niagara Falls! Niagara Falls, here we come! Did you see my book? ''Make Your Honeymoon Perfect''! You don't see that every day. How about some bathrooms? We've been on the road since Covington. l told Silas a girl just can't hold it forever. Whoa! You've got a kitty on your head, man. You've got a kitty-cat. But seriously, nice sidecar, dude. -You like a warm-up, Cowboy? -Lookie there. Aren't those some pretty creatures? You know, when it comes to horses, l'm kind of a philosopher. Suppose you're wonderin' what l mean by that. Hey, Tiger, over here! We got company. Look. Silas got a good chunk of his sentence cut for showin' such good behavior. l mean, that's what Raymond said, good behavior, it's true. -Don't tell them that. -But it's true! l'm not ashamed to tell them. -Camille. . . -Just shows how worldly you are. You served your time, and now you're mine. l would go see him during visitation. He looked so cute in that orange jumpsuit. All the guards said we made a perfect couple. -Ahhh. . . -l've known Silas since l was six. -Show them your tattoos, Tiger. -No! He didn't have those back then. He's such a rebel, isn't he? l mean, nobody smokes anymore. Wow. Are truckers really this nice, or are we just in good moods? You just have to tell them everything about everything. l think the dress sort of gave me away. Besides, rule number 1 5 in the honeymoon guide book says, ''Always tell people that you're newlyweds.'' ''They will sometimes offer you special discounts.'' -Why don't you just invite them along? -Don't be grumpy, Tiger. l'm not ''grumpy, Tiger.'' l'm mad. Why do you have to be so damn happy all the time? lt makes us both look stupid. You know, l'm sick of your damn honeymoon guidebooks and your Niagara Falls stories and all your talking! That's all you do is talk! Can't you just shut up for once in your life? Please. Please. Just try and keep your mouth shut once. Please. Can you do that? Don't do it. They have hash. l never had hash before-- Please. Shut up. Have you had hash? Ma'am? Are you okay? Yeah. Once we get to the Falls, we'll be okay. We just both want to get there so badly. lt's just that Silas is the strong, silent type and l sometimes talk more than he's used to, but he doesn't mind, really. [ Motorcycle engine rumbles ] See? He's just itchin' to get there. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk! Talk! Talk, talk. . . ! A horse will be scared of the smallest things -- a flower bush, a puddle of water. He'll see the puddle, but he can't understand it. So he'll rear back, afraid. Now. . . Thank you. Now, we people, we can see it for what it is. lt's just water. So why should we be scared? Are you following me here, ma'am? l'm sorry. Somethin' about horses. . .? Yes, ma'am. Just somethin' about horses. [ Motorcycle engine rumbles ] Well, l guess this is it, then. Thanks for the company, Mister Cowboy Bob. Hey. . . you two are gonna make it. l got a sense. You got that connected kinda feelin'. Good. Goodbye, ma'am. Bye. Yeah. Come on. We can't miss that big freakin' waterfall. Silas, do you love me? l married you, didn't l? Tiger, please. You do love me, don't you? Well, that wasn't really the question that l meant to ask. You know, it just sort of came out wrong. l don't mean, l don't mean ''love,'' ''love me'' -- well not yet, anyways. l mean, people grow to love each other, so we got lots of time. Camille! Get on the bike, please. Please get on the bike! [ Camera clicks ] [ Motorcycle engine rumbles ] [ Crying ] [ Clanking ] Silas, my ring! l dropped my ring! [ Honking ] Silas! Hey. . . Don't sit so close to the new TT. You'll go blind. Here you go. Looks like Daddy forgot his wallet again. A phone! -You, you're covered in-- -A phone! l need a phone! -Who's he calling? -l don't know. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hello? Hello? Please don't hurt us. We don't have anything. l killed her! -l don't care what you've done, okay? -l killed her. -We won't say anything to anyone. -l killed her! You just go on. Just. . . Here. . . just take the money. Please don't hurt us. Camille! Camille! Camille? Camille! Oh, there you are, Tiger! You okay? Yeah, l'm here. l'm a little mucky. l don't think they're gonna take my dress back. My neck's a little sore, but you can touch it. l thought l killed you. Tiger, look at your shirt! You look awful. l'm gonna have to get you to the doctor. What happened? We wrecked. l don't remember much. l just. . . Tiger, you're shaking. Are you okay? l thought you were gone. l'm not goin' anywhere. Except to Niagara Falls with you. You sure you don't remember anything? Well, l remember the wedding and getting in the sidecar. Did we stop somewhere? That part is a little fuzzy. Oh, right. Here. Oh, Tiger, you found it. Oh, Tiger, your poor bike. Should we go to that house? Maybe they'll give us a ride. No. That's a bad idea. Farmers. [ Police sirens ] -Tiger. Hey! -Camille! Get down! Hey! Hey! They didn't even beep, Tiger! l'm on parole! Oh, Camille! l almost blew it! [ Honking ] Hi. Did he say who he was calling? No. He didn't actually talk to anyone. He said, um. . . he said he killed her. And he seemed real upset about killin' her. And he was wearin' that tuxedo, which l guess seemed peculiar. -Did he say who he killed? -He killed our damn TT! We already established that, son. Hey, Sheriff! Got this. Run a check on those. See what we get. Hey, Camille! You all right in there? -Can you hear me? Camille? -Be out in a minute! [ Phone rings ] -Raymond. . . -Silas? Silas, what's goin' on? -Somethin's wrong with Camille. -ls she okay? Well, yeah, she says she's okay. She wants to keep goin' , but. . . somethin's wrong. Not now. You got a call from some sheriff in Ohio investigating a robbery. -Says he's gotta talk to you pronto. -All right. All right. Silas, listen. l want to talk to her, but you tell Camille if she's sick, turn around, come home. She's got her whole life to see the Falls. Will you tell her that? Now, now, hold on. Yeah, Foster. What? Get in bed, Tiger! After a hot shower, l'm a frisky kitty. [ Growls and meows ] l've decided no more poutin' from Camille. lt takes two to tango. l'm gonna make this fun for you, too. Co-o-m-me. . . C-o-o-m-me to m-m-e-e-e. . . Tiger? Tiger. [ Phone rings ] Good morning. This is your wake-up call. Camille? Wake up. . . Wake up time. Camille! [ Neighing ] Tiger. . . l just had this dream. Whoa. . . Look at you. You're all dressed. -Yeah. -What's the story, morning glory? l get a kiss this mornin'? That was a handshake, not a kiss. -l've got to take a shower. -But you're all dressed. l know. CAMlLLE: You know, whenever l'm in a new place like this, l always think, what if l lived here instead of home, you know? l mean, what if l always lived here? And then l think, l never would have met Silas. What if you lived somewhere else and we never met? Then l think, l would have met you wherever l lived. l was meant to. Love is a powerful thing, Silas. lt's the thing that keeps me going. l could use some color. You look. . . nice. -Really? -Yeah. Listen, you wanna try on some more? l'll buy as many as you want. Okay! -Okay? -Okay. May l have that hat, too, please? Okay. That will be $959.29. How do you wanna pay for all this? Okay. . . Wayne. Silas! Oh. . . -lt's our honeymoon. -Oh. Right this way. How can we afford this? l didn't budget for chandeliers and Olympic pools. Hi. -Hi there. l love your place. -Thank you. l'll take that bag. Oh, thanks. Okay. Here we are. The honeymoon suite. Oh, my God! Maybe we should let some fresh air in here, huh? -Yeah. -Oh, this is gonna be fun, Tiger! lf there's anything you need, don't hesitate to call the front desk. -Thank you. -They will send someone. -Bye, Leslie! -Bye! Thanks! -l've gotta take a shower. -Again? You like me to come in there with you, Tiger? No! Oh, shit. Camille? Camille! l brought you a robe. l'm fine in here, thanks. Come on. You've been in there long enough. You could come in here with me, Tiger. No. Come on. Tiger, why are you being so nice to me? l mean, l appreciate it. But l wanna know, is there somethin' wrong? You wouldn't believe me. Well, try me. You're dead. Oh, my God! Tiger, look! -Come on! -You saw a blue horse? Yeah. l think it went this way. lt sounds crazy, but l've seen this horse before. Look. . . Oh, my God, is this real? Well. . . Look what the horse dragged in. l was hopin' we'd see you again someday. Figured you'd be up to the Falls by now. Oh, but we took a few wrong turns, but Tiger got us back on track. Right, Tiger? Why would you. . . paint a horse? COWBOY BOB: Well, it all started with a dream. But l'll tell you, it sure makes their teeth look brighter, don't it? -Sure does. -She's not very strong. Well, that's Maggie. l told you about her. -You don't remember that part, huh? -No. Well, Maggie knows you. l told her all about you. Ain't that right, Maggie? Didn't l tell her? Maggie likes you. l like Maggie. Tiger, you're turning green. l should have warned you. Maggie's been so sick lately, l've been experimenting with a special feed. COWBOY BOB: l like to try out new recipes. l can't hardly smell anything anymore. l got used to it, l guess. You need it in this business. ln the cowboy business? No, ma'am. The cowboy business is dead and gone. This here is. . . show business. Show business. . . You know, Maggie's about the smartest horse l've ever known. COWBOY BOB: One day she just wandered in and found me. Don't know why. COWBOY BOB: But l knew there had to be a reason for it. l could see it in her eyes. And ever since then, l've just been tryin' like heck to keep her goin'. You know, l'm not one of them New Age cowboys, but l believe in fate. That's beautiful. Silas, isn't that the sweetest thing you ever heard? COWBOY BOB: lt's comin' to the end of the trail for Maggie. l know that. Well, Roy Rogers had Trigger preserved after he died. Least, that's the story l heard. CAMlLLE: Do you smell somethin'? COWBOY BOB: l can't smell anything but horses. Silas, do you smell that? -Yes. -CAMlLLE: lt's weird. l wonder what it is. lt's you. CAMlLLE: Silas Parker, l don't smell! Do l? Yes. Hey. . . -Where you goin'? -You stay. Obviously, l need to go. Well, she didn't smell. How much? Roger that. We'll be up there. Mark! -l'm gonna stop that asshole. -RAYMOND: Hey, now. We won't need that. SHERlFF STElNER: The family he robbed said he carried on about killin' somebody. SHERlFF STElNER: We're lookin' at a parole violation turned robbery turned possible homicide. -That's a red flag. -He's not even capable of murder. Silas steals things. Little things. Once he stole a microwave for his mama's birthday. You know, that's kind of sweet. RAYMOND: Now, look. l know the boy. Deep down inside, he's a decent fellow. And that's why you let him jump parole? Because deep down, he was not on parole? Come on! lt's their honeymoon. Besides, you don't know Camille. She always gets what she wants. She's wanted him practically her whole life. SHERlFF STElNER: Well, l found this in the cornfields yesterday. . . near the accident site. l'll say he was pretty prepared. -This is their honeymoon money. -They're not on a honeymoon. They're runnin' for the border! Hey, l understand she's your niece. You can tag along. But like it or not, this is my honeymoon now. The missus seems kind of tuckered. She's dead. Oh, yeah. Yeah. l know what you mean. When l haven't slept well, l can hardly get started the next day. No, she's not tired. She's dead. ln what sense? She's decaying, fallin' apart. lt gets worse every minute. -She doesn't seem too upset about it. -She doesn't know. l mean, how are you supposed to tell someone that they're dead? Hmm. . . Exactly. [ Alarm rings ] [music] Pull in the club [music] [music] We hear the bang bang [music] [music] Roll through the door [music] Bob! Bob? [ ''Four on the Floor'' plays ] Got ten gallons of formaldehyde. Go! [music] Do what you came to [music] [music] You can't numb that feeling of that four on the floor [music] l can't believe l did that. That was great, Bob.

SlLAS: Formaldehyde will get rid of the smell. How will you break it to her? l don't know. My wife usually does all the talking. You sure are an unusual couple. Yeah. [ Lock clicks ] l'm home. [ Crying ] Camille? Silas. . . Camille? What's wrong? [ Crying ] Hey. [ Sobbing ] -CAMlLLE: Don't, Silas. Just don't! -lt's okay. Don't, Silas! Don't look at me! lt's okay. What's happening to me? l don't understand it. Everyone can see it. l look so terrible. Why is this happening? l think you're dead. What? l think you're dead. That's not possible. -How can that be? -l don't know. lt doesn't make any sense. Come here. -But, Tiger, this is our honeymoon. -Shh. . . l got you somethin'. Ta da! lt's red. Yeah. Red. Yeah. Don't look at me. l get shy. l said not to look at me! [ Laughs ] [ Hums a tune ] What are you doing? Just bein' stupid. Do you like it? lt's the most beautiful thing l've ever seen. You really think so? Yeah. Thank you, Tiger. What are we gonna do, Silas? CAMlLLE: Just tell me l'll be okay. l'm not really dead. Okay? All right. And we're gonna make it to the Falls. We're not gonna stop now, not for anything. We can make it. lf it's the last thing l do, Camille, l promise you l'll get you to Niagara Falls. SHERlFF STElNER: Damn bagel is two weeks old. She used to plan her whole schedule around his parole meetings just so she could get a glimpse of him in my office. -You didn't talk her out of this? -RAYMOND: l tried. l showed her surveillance tapes the night we picked him up on a B & E. All she could talk about was how cute he looked in that sweater. How can you stand in the way of somethin' like that? l would have shot the guy. [ Whistles ] [ Police sirens ] We're just gonna bring him in for questioning, right? We aren't gonna hurt anybody? Well, that's up to him. But just in case things get ugly, you're stayin' here, and you're not goin' up there until l see what we've got. This is my niece. Come on. Stay. And you stay with him. Camille? -SlLAS: You all right? -Never better, Tiger. Today is a new day. Yeah. LESLlE: Yes, sir, it's right here. [ Police sirens ] POLlCEMAN: Perimeter secure? POLlCEWOMAN: l've got the perimeter secure, yes. POLlCEMAN: l'm pulling around back. All right, let's move in, guys. l've got the exits! All right, l've got it! [ Knocking ] Bellman! [ Whispers ] -Hey! Hey! -What? Shh! [ Knocking ] Bellman! -SlLAS: All right, can you jump? -CAMlLLE: Oh, God! -Tiger, what about all our stuff? -l got it right here. l can't jump down there! l can't! Tiger, l can't. All right. All right, then. l'm gonna need you to do somethin' else, okay? Okay. Oh, l've got a key. Okay. [ Door unlocks and chain rattles ] [ Sighs ] Police! Freeze! -SHERlFF STElNER: Oh, Jesus. -DEPUTY RUDDY: Check the room. SHERlFF STElNER: Stone cold. Send in the coroner. She's dead. DEPUTY RUDDY: Balcony's clear! [ Flashes click ] Any idea on those stains? l think it's formaldehyde. Sick bastard. [ Elevator beeps ] [ Elevator music plays ] PARAMEDlC: You never get used to this stuff. We're immune to it, ma'am. When you're an officer, you've been to those dark places. You've seen the evil that lurks in the hearts of men-- [ Sneezes ] [ Screams ] OFFlCER RlLEY: No, stop, please! Oh! [music] l want a girl like that [music] [music] That makes me want to dream [music] OFFlCER RlLEY: Freeze! Freeze!

We all make mistakes. Chief, l swear to God, she sneezed in the elevator. The last time l saw her, Riley, she was dead, D-E-D, and not breathin'. But you saw her sneezing, huh? -Hmm? -Yeah. Then what did she do, start flyin' around the room? Uh, no, actually she ran down a hallway. CAMlLLE: Jeez, Tiger, this was supposed to be our new life, no more trouble with the authorities, and here l am, your new wife, and l'm getting you in trouble. -There's a hole in your shirt. -What? Oh, God. l love this shirt. This was our shoppin' spree shirt. You bought it for me. You know what it is? l knew it -- it's the rice. l told them we had to have rice at the wedding. l said it isn't a wedding without rice. lt was a bad sign. There's another hole right there. Let me take a look. Holy shit! -SlLAS: That's a bullet hole. -l feel fine. l don't want to talk about it. There's nothin' wrong with just a, you know. . . a itty-bitty little hole in my shoulder. -Two holes. -There's nothin' wrong with me. You know what else? l love my red hair. l do. When my hair grows back, l think l'm gonna color it this way. That's nice.

You know how it is. l'm not cut out for this kinda thing -- breaking and entering, thievin' , mayhem. . . That's for the young kids. l'm an old man, Silas. l didn't sleep a wink last night. Just get us to the border. Then you can forget you even knew us. Sorry, fellow. l'm no good for you. Or anybody. MS. SAMUELS: Well, l've known Robert going on 1 5 years now. He's always had this horse. l know he takes good care of Maggie, but look at the blisters here. You're gonna start peeling like old paint soon. She ought to be gone by now. Maybe she isn't ready to leave yet. Nobody's ever ready for that, are they? You know, a young and pretty new bride like you shouldn't be walking around in an old, dirty, tattered, old skirt. l know. l sort of lost all my clothes along the way. You like rodeo clothes? COWBOY BOB: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. . . these are horses of a different color. Here, the ride never stops. Here, life is forever. Now, you stay on there, little girl. lsn't he cute, Silas, helpin' out? Silas, look. lt's so silly, Tiger. You didn't kill anybody. Why would they say that? What are we gonna do? -We're gonna get out of here. -l mean, after that. What happens when we want to go back home? l'm not goin' back home. Okay. COWBOY BOB: Silas? Man, can you please just take us to the Falls? You're not goin' to the dance? l don't dance. You've never danced with your wife? She can't wait forever. [ Hums ] She's not lookin' so good, Bob. Well, still alive, still kickin'. That's a happy horse that can say that, even if she can't really say it. Ooh, looks like she needs a touch-up. [ Neighing ] CAMlLLE: Bob? Can l ask you a weird favor? Whoa! Burnt orange! l'll look so tan! Okay. What's that? Oh, just ignore that part. You can paint right over it, right? Camille? Come on out. [music] There was a time [music] [music] When they played for the love of the game [music] [music] Everybody stood by the promises they made [music] [music] That was somewhere way back when [music] CAMlLLE: See? CAMlLLE: You're a fine dancer, Tiger. Feel like everybody's watchin' me. Tiger, please. Everybody's watchin' me, not you. What? What's the matter? Nothin'. Everything's good. You know, l think l'm feeling better. l feel like l'm comin' through all of this. l mean, it could have been some temporary coma or, like, a weird virus that just sort of slowed my body down. Those things happen all the time, l bet -- we just don't hear about it. Could be. [music] We bow our heads and pray [music] [music] And faith was more than just a word [music] [music] You heard some preacher say [music] [music] That was somewhere way back when [music] [music] That's the way the world was then [music] [music] When l love you now and forever [music] [music] Up until the very end [music] [music] l like the way that things are now [music] [music] Where the Lord is right without [music] [music] l want the kind of love our parents had [music] [music] We can love again [music] [music] The ways.

Till death do us part! Remember? l'm dead, Tiger! l think that's grounds for separation. [ Sobbing ] Just leave me alone, please. Just let me die! [ Clanking ] l'm not gonna let you die. You're still my wife. POLlCE OFFlCER: Stop right there, sir! Now, sir! Get your hands on the hood! Do it now, sir! Get down! Get down!

She believes in me. l don't know why. No one's ever believed in me before. [ Birds chirping ] [ Coughs ] Where's Bob? [ Buzzing ] [ Neighing ] SlLAS: Bob? l was hopin' you'd sleep through this. Go on back in the truck. Let me do this. SlLAS: What are you doin' , Bob? Somethin' l should have done years ago. -lt's time to go. -Bob, don't do it! Don't do it, Bob!

You take the truck. lf l stay with you, l'll just slow you down. COWBOY BOB: Go on. l'm stayin'. Where will you go, Bob? Wherever she takes me. Good luck to you two. [ Neighing ] Tiger! Look! [ Camera clicks ] CAMlLLE: We're here! -Jeez! -Yeah. Well, l knew it would be big, but jeez! Yeah, it's their truck for sure. Must have just gotten here a couple minutes ago. SHERlFF STElNER: Okay, l'm on my way. l don't want anybody shooting until l get there! Ten-four. [ Coughs ] Got you somethin'. Thank you, Tiger. SlLAS: You know, that's a nasty habit to get into. Well, it's a good time for a bad habit. Besides, l think the risk of lung cancer decreases when you don't have lungs any more. [ Coughs ] Come on, Camille. This is your big trip. We're here. So, what do you wanna do? Let's do what you came here to do. l didn't really forget everything. You were lying to me? l was pretending, Tiger. lf l pretend to forget what you said at the truck stop, then maybe we'd both forget. At least that's what l thought. Camille, just because you're dead doesn't always make you right. Now, come on. Let's take this stupid boat ride. Come on, girl. [ People chattering ] [ Horn sounds ] What? l'm ready now. What? l'm ready now. l'll get a picture. All right? Silas! l love you. [ Camera clicks ] Excuse me. Can you take a picture of us? Thank you. Camille! Camille! [ Boat engine rumbles ] SHERlFF STElNER: Like lookin' for a needle in a damn haystack! Still don't think he'd cross on foot. He doesn't look that stupid. From what l can tell, he's 1 00% stupid. That's what makes him smart. What? [ People chattering ] Grrr. . . -RAYMOND: Silas. . . ! -Raymond. Raymond! Raymond. . . ! Wait! Raymond, you don't understand! -What did you do to her? -l didn't do anything! What did you. . .? She's still alive. You gotta trust me. Look, l need her, Ray. l need her. Okay? l'm a lawman, but l'm not afraid to take the law in my own hands. The real law. The law of love. Get going, son. POLlCE: Clear back! Make way! Make way! Wait! Get back! -You let him take you, you idiot? -Look, l'll shoot him! -Then shoot him! He's an idiot! -l will! POLlCE: Get back, get back! [ Screaming ] Let's go! [ Police sirens ] SlLAS: Move! [ Police sirens ] Silas! Freeze! Freeze! Get out of the way! He's headed for the horseshoe! Box him in! Move it! Look out! MAN: Watch out! -WOMAN: He's got a gun! -BYSTANDER: Who's got a gun? MAN: The guy in the black jacket. [ Commotion and police sirens ] SHERlFF STElNER: Hold it, Silas! Hold it! Drop it! You're boxed in! Hold it! Give it up! You've got nowhere to go! Give it up! Silas! Drop that gun! Camille! Fire a warning shot. [ Gunshot ] Camille! Silas! Drop that gun! [ Gunshot ] CAMlLLE: Tiger. . . Tiger. . . Why did you come back, Tiger? Why? You should have left without me. l couldn't. l love you. Tiger. . . l had a great honeymoon. Me, too. Wait! You can't just leave! [ Commotion ] [ Sprinkling ] lt's rice. it's rice. <i>Where did you get that girl?</i> <i>Oh, you lucky devil</i> <i>Where did you get that girl?</i> <i>Tell me on the level</i> <i>Have you ever kissed her?</i> <i>If she has a sister</i> <i>Lead me, lead me</i> <i>Lead me to her mister</i> <i>Gee, I wish that I had a girl</i> <i>I'd love her, I'd love her</i> <i>Oh, goodness, how I'd love her</i> <i>If you can find another</i> <i>I'll take her home to Mother</i> <i>Where? Where?</i> <i>Where did you get that girl?</i> Five bows and an encore. Not bad for a Tuesday night, huh? They loved you, Jess. Come on, I'll buy you a steak. Hey, wait. I wanna watch Mendoza's opening trick. - What, again? - Hi, Jess. Bert, big news. I just closed the deal for you. Eighty weeks solid on the Orpheum time. Two seasons straight. How do you like that? Watch this. It's terrific. Here's your new song. Hot off the presses. "'Where Did You Get That Girl? ' Words by Bert Kalmar co-author of 'Hello, Hawaii,' 'Oh! What a Pal Was Mary."' - Am I an agent? - Yeah, yeah. Now, look. - Hey, what's going on? - Magic is going on. Come in. - Oh, I thought you'd be dressed by now. - Jess, listen. Come here. I've got a great idea, an opening for the new act. I come out in one, see? I'm a magician. - Oh, a magician. - Yeah. I'm in a full dress suit, medals on my chest maybe a mustache and a little goatee. Yes, I adore little goatees. And you come on as my assistant. I hand you my gloves. Hey, wait a minute. - You're not walking out on me, are you? - Not yet. - What you open the door for? - Because I'm a nice girl, Mr. Kalmar. And a nice girl always leaves the door open. You know, we could fix all that so you won't have to worry about doors. We could get married. I'd like that. Maybe someday when you're not so rushed, Bert. So you don't have to propose in short pants. Listen, Jess, I'm not kidding. Neither am I. You're too busy, Bert. A big headliner, important songwriter. A magician. Now you're writing a play. You want to be everything in show business all at once. And I just want to be a wife. You couldn't light in one spot long enough for the ceremony. Okay, Jess. But if you ever do decide to marry me, you'll speak right up, won't you? You'll be the first to know. Thanks, Jess. Well, what about that magic idea? Well, what's the matter? - Just a couple of tricks for an opening? - And for a finish, you saw me in half. Next thing you know, you'll be doing a single. "Kalmar The Magnificent." Maybe you think I couldn't. - Maybe I'll surprise you. - Nothing you did would surprise me. You know, sometimes I think you'd rather be a bad magician than a good actor. - How do I look? - Beautiful. - Do I need a flower? - What for? I think I need a flower. - Pretty fancy, huh? - Just wonderful. - Telephone, Mr. Kalmar. - Okay. Be right back. Clanahan's Paradise, the best beer on the island. See Kendall The Great, miracles and marvels of magic. And appearing on the stage right now, The Four Little Boys in Gray. Fifteen acts of. <i>Jimmy O'Leary said I've got a theory</i> <i>She's different from all of your girls</i> <i>She's not a queen</i> <i>Like you see on the screen</i> <i>And she ain't got</i> <i>No diamonds or pearls</i> <i>But she's mine, all mine</i> Giants 4, Philadelphia 2. End of the seventh. <i>I told her I worked in a glue factory</i> <i>And that's how she happened</i> <i>To get stuck on me</i> - I'll take over. - Thanks. <i>And she's mine, all mine</i> - Hey, Ruby. - Yes, sir? - Where you going? - This is my supper hour. I thought I'd go out for a catch. Yeah? Well, take it on the hop to dressing room four. Kendall The Great needs an assistant. Say, Mr. Clanahan, would you mind if I asked one of the acts to sing a song that I wrote? It's called "On the Shores of Araby." It goes like this: <i>I can't forget the night we met</i> <i>On the shores of Araby</i> <i>The moon lit up the sky</i> <i>And love lit up your eyes</i> <i>I kissed you once</i> <i>I kissed you twice</i> <i>As I held you gently</i> <i>That night upon the shores of Araby</i> - <i>I never</i>. - You wrote that? Yes, sir. Words and music both. Well, take it on the hop to dressing room four. Kendall The Great needs an assistant. Yes, sir. Come in. Mr. Kendall? Ebbetts Field is that way. No, I'm your assistant. Mr. Clanahan said. Okay. Take those boxes backstage and pile them up behind the drapes. Yes, sir. Now, when I'm on, I'll give you signal like this: Whenever you hear that you take the top box shove an animal through the hole in the drapes and into the back of the table. Got it? Animals, huh? - I want them in just that order. - Yeah. Don't fool around with that goose. He's vicious. Well, they usually are. Ladies and gentlemen, since time began man has placed his trust in the witch doctor the sorcerer and the voodoo. Who dares to call them frauds? Watch carefully, please. Is this trickery or magic? Now, I have here a gentleman's ordinary silk hat. As you can plainly see there are no secret pockets and no hidden springs. I place the hat on the table. Go on, get in there. Go on, what are you waiting for? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the identical hat. I'll fill it from this pitcher of water. Like this. Is this trickery or magic? - Oh, look, a goose. - Now, but don't go near him. He's vicious. Look. I would like your attention, please. Watch carefully. Now think of a card. Any card in the deck. A scientific exhibition of mind over matter. For my next deception, I have here a little handkerchief. What's going on.? I'll be right back, Mr. Clanahan. - You see a goose go by here? - I saw a lot of them down there. Watch carefully, please. Ordinary hat. Ordinary drinking water. I pour it in the hat like this: Place it on my head like that. - Where is he? Where is he? - Just a minute, you. That baseball player, if I ever lay my hands on him. Get out of my theater and don't ever come back. I ought to sue you for that performance. I ought to take you to court, you small-time swami. Oh, shut up. - Hello. - What are you doing here? Charlie traced you for me. Nice comedy routine, Bert. That maniac in a baseball hat. I was going great until then. - I had them right there, I was killing them. - Listen to him. Every theater in the country is waiting for Kalmar and Brown but Kendall The Great is killing them in Coney Island at 5 bucks a night. What were you trying to prove? That we ought to use magic in the act? Not necessarily. You know what magic is to me. - It's a hobby. It relaxes me. - You look relaxed. Come in. - Say, a couple of them got away. - Get out of here! Bert Kalmar. That's Bert Kalmar, the songwriter. Say, Mr. Clanahan, that's Bert Kalmar. - I saw him at the Palace. - Yeah. I heard you tell the rabbit. I recognized him without his mustache. Sure, sure. Here, son. And don't look for another job right away. Just take a nice, long rest. Thank you. Thank you. Now, with your kind indulgence we'd like to show you what happens when two dancers get married. Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer at home. Thank you. They loved you, Jess. See them applaud? - Bert, I was so nervous. - So was I. You know. - Sorry, Mr. Kalmar. - My fault. Flowers for you. Oh, they're beautiful. Who are they from? The president and I. We chipped in. - Bert, what is it? - I don't know. "Kalmar and Brown, who opened their new act to bravos last month have been cancelled following an accident backstage. Doctors say Kalmar will not be able to dance for at least a year, possibly two." I couldn't think of a tougher break. It's Jessie I'm thinking about. She can't just sit around waiting. When you lay off too long, they think you're through. And I'm not gonna let that happen to her. Now, why can't she just pick up another partner and take out the same act? Bert, I told you, the act needs your name. She wouldn't make the expenses. - You sunk a lot of dough into it, huh? - Not much. Just everything I own. - Hello. - Hi, Jess. - Hello. - I've ordered breakfast. - How are you, Charlie? - Good. - Hey, doughnuts? - Sure. Why did you have to go shopping? No room service? I figured we'd save the tip. That wolf at the door might get pretty hungry. I've got to catch a rehearsal down at Loew's. - I'll see you, Jess. Bert. - Bye, Charlie. See you later. Come here, honey. Now, listen. That crack about the wolf at the door, that's out, see? - You won't be around to meet him. - No? I've been talking to Charlie. We figured you ought to go out as a single. I can write a new routine. Charlie guarantees the booking, says it's a cinch. You boys have been wasting your time. My plans are all set. I always told you if ever I changed my mind you'd be the first to know. Of course, it took a broken kneecap to make you stop bouncing long enough. But I'm satisfied. Say, maybe you didn't hear me. I just accepted your proposal. Look, Jess. I won't be bouncing for a long time yet. And a fellow with a wife to support has to get around pretty fast, you know. Well, I'm not a girl that needs a new sable every winter. What about your writing, Bert? Your play, your songs? You don't have to click your heels in the air to write a lyric. Now, wait a minute. I'd like to write a great play, sure. Who wouldn't? And those songs, they're just a sideline for fun. I never tried to make a living at it. I'm not even sure I can. Until I find out, l. You don't want me hanging around your neck. Is that it? I didn't say that. Now, don't be sore at me, huh? I'm not sore. But it isn't every day that a girl gets turned down. Jessie, listen. Listen. Jessie! Jessie! Wish you could write another song like that. - I could sure use it. - I'll tell you a secret, Al. - So could I. - Well, what's the matter? Oh, I don't know. I just haven't hit on anything. - I can't seem to get started. - Oh, you will. What do you hear from Jessie? Oh, she framed a new act. Doing fine. Say, what is that? One of your new ones? That? Some Arabian song one of our pluggers wrote. Plays it all day long, drives me nuts. Get me Harry Ruby. I think I'll throw him out of here. Arabian song, huh? Not a bad tune. Yeah, it is kind of catchy. Hello, Ruby, come in here, son. Let you talk to him. You know, an Araby song might be just the thing right now. - Yes, chief? - Oh, come in, Ruby. Bert, this is Harry Ruby. - Bert Kalmar. - Hi. Ruby, Mr. Kalmar wants to hear that Arabian song of yours. Yes. You bet. Yes, sir. It's called "On the Shores of Araby That Night." "That Night With You." <i>I can't forget the night we met</i> <i>On the shores of Araby</i> <i>The moon lit up the sky</i> <i>And love lit up your eye</i> - Hold it, wait a minute. - Yeah, hold it. - Who wrote that lyric? - Well, I did. Words and music both. Well, you know, you haven't got an Arabian song there. - You don't think so? - No. - Play it again, will you? - Sure. No, no. It's more like Dixie. A Dixie tune. Maybe Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee. Sure. Look. <i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i> Gee, that's swell, Mr. Kalmar. Tennessee. Well, you boys go right ahead. - Take all day if you want. - Okay, Al. Great. Let me see. <i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i> Say, don't I know you? Well, I don't think so, Mr. Kalmar. <i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i> <i>Down among</i>. You worked here long? Oh, for a couple of months, Mr. Kalmar. - Have a cigar. - Oh, gee, thanks. <i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i> That's it. Try it. <i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i> That ought to do it. Here, take it from the top. <i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i> <i>In my Dixie paradise</i> <i>An angel's voice I hear</i> <i>I mean my mammy dear</i> <i>I'd give my soul if I could stroll</i> <i>Down among those hills again</i> <i>For all the world</i> <i>Would not be dreary then</i> <i>I'd love to go to sleep and know</i> <i>That tomorrow I'd arise</i> <i>Beneath those southern skies</i> <i>Where songbirds harmonize</i> <i>Lordy, hear my plea</i> <i>Make me what I wanna be</i> <i>A rolling stone just rolling home</i> <i>To my sunny Tennessee</i> Gosh, that's wonderful, Mr. Kendall. Thanks. Kendall? Oh, I remember now. The pigeons, the rabbits. Oh, I remember you! Please, Mr. Kendall. I mean, Mr. Kalmar. You pin-headed baseball player. Do you realize what you did that night? - It was the goose. - Goose? Goose? Five hundred people out front and. You don't know that goose. He was the meanest thing. I knew I remembered that face. I got a bad feeling the second I saw you. You're a menace. Run away and hide before you do real damage. Let bygones be bygones. Get away from me. I should write a song with a jinx like you. Here. As far as I'm concerned, it never left Araby. Goose. Oh, hello, Mr. Kalmar. I got your message. You write this ad? "The nation's number one song hit, 'My Sunny Tennessee' by that sensational new writing team, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby." - Well, yeah, you see, l. - Who made you my partner? - Well, nobody, but. - Now, listen, kid. You might as well understand something right now. Because I wrote one song with you doesn't make us roommates. I'm not teaming up with anybody. Soon as I can swing this leg again, I'd be back in vaudeville. Until then, I'll write with anyone who happens to have a good tune. - Now, is that clear? - Sure, that's very clear, Mr. Kalmar. Okay. Where are the doughnuts? Thanks, Johnnie. Well, got any new tunes? As a matter of fact, I've got a tune but I haven't thought of words for it yet. Good. My spikes. Al Schacht gave me those. Al Schacht. He's a pitcher in the big league. Maybe you've heard of him? Al Schacht? - Play the tune. - Sure. Hey, have you got any with chocolate on top? Coming up. You don't like it, huh? Sure, sure. It's a nice little tune. You ought to do something with it sometime. You ought to do something with that shirt too. Real silk, $4. You got any other tunes? Well. Let's see, I. Well, don't pull a ligament. You know there hasn't been a good Japanese song for quite a while. Got something here I thought might work out. I call it "So Long, Oo-long." I figured the rhythm is something like this: <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you gonna be gone?</i> You got something to fit that? Well, let's see. How about this? Wait a minute. Try that again, will you? <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you gonna be gone?</i> Now, wait a minute. That's the same tune you just played. Well, I know it. Are you trying to put something over on me? - Well, no, I thought it would fit. - Well, it doesn't fit. What's the matter with you, you only got one tune? - I got plenty of tunes in me. - Well, I've only heard one tune. Yeah, I know. Right now, all I got is one rotten tune. Take it easy, kid. Now, don't get excited. - Don't get excited. - Who's excited? I'm not excited. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll leave this lyric. If you come up with something, give me a ring. If you don't, well, don't worry. See you around. <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you gonna be gone?</i> <i>Your little Japanee</i> <i>Will be waiting</i> <i>Underneath the bamboo tree</i> <i>So don't be too long, Oo-long</i> <i>I'll long while you're away</i> <i>Waiting for the day</i> <i>When you come back to me</i> <i>I'll sit and sigh</i> <i>'Neath the oriental sky</i> <i>Each day that I</i> <i>Am left alone</i> <i>In Nagasaki</i> <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you gonna roam?</i> <i>Please don't be too long</i> <i>Oo-long, so long</i> <i>Hurry back home</i> <i>Ming Toy</i> <i>Loved a boy</i> <i>Happy little Japanee</i> <i>Oo-long was his name</i> <i>Set her heart aflame</i> - <i>One day, he say</i> - <i>Soon I got to go away</i> - <i>When he leave</i> - <i>Ming Toy grieve</i> <i>Everybody hear her say</i> <i>I'll sit and sigh</i> <i>'Neath the oriental sky</i> <i>Each day that I</i> <i>Am left alone</i> <i>In Nagasaki</i> <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you going to roam?</i> <i>Please don't be too long</i> <i>Oo-long, so long</i> <i>Hurry back home</i> - Hi, boys. - Yes, sir, 10 cents. Right. We have. No, no, no. The Palace tonight. I fixed it with Mrs. Carter DeHaven to hear your song. - Well. - Not that, the new one. If she likes it, she'll introduce it next week. <i>Who's sorry now?</i> <i>Who's sorry now?</i> <i>Whose heart is aching</i> <i>For breaking each vow?</i> <i>Who's sad and blue?</i> <i>Who's crying too?</i> <i>Just like I cried over you</i> <i>Right to the end</i> <i>Just like a friend</i> <i>I tried to warn you</i> <i>Somehow</i> <i>You had your way</i> <i>Now you must pay</i> <i>I'm glad that you're sorry now</i> <i>Right to the end</i> <i>Just like a friend</i> <i>I tried to warn you</i> <i>Somehow</i> <i>You had your way</i> <i>Now you must pay</i> <i>I'm glad</i> <i>That you're sorry now</i> Oh, that's great. Looks like another hit. You're making a habit of it. - Thank you. - We'll introduce it next week. - Oh, good, thanks. - Oh, Bert, how is your knee? - Oh, better, better. Thank you. - Wonderful. I'm glad. Excuse me. - Boys, it was just great, that's all. - Bert, swell. Bert, I want a copy to send on to Jessie. Can't you hear her sing it? - Yeah, sure. - It was like it was written for her. Oh, I suppose you haven't heard the news. - No. - Well, it's not settled yet. But she may team up with Bill Courtney next season. They'll do an act like she used to do with you. Well, it's not definite yet. They ought to do all right. He's a very talented guy. - Yeah. - See you later, Charlie. Yeah, yeah. Good night. Oh, me and my big mouth. Yeah, he doesn't talk about her very much anymore. Hey, where is she playing next week? - Jessie? - Yeah. Montreal, at Queen's Theatre. Why? I'll see you later. <i>Where did you get that girl?</i> <i>Oh, you lucky devil</i> What's the matter? Can't a fella dance if he feels like it? - Well, I didn't say anything. - What are you gaping at? I'm not gaping. I always look this way. - You hurt your leg again, Bert? - No. It's all right. - I just gotta cut out those knee drops. - Yeah. You know what I think? We ought to take a little vacation. I mean it. We've been working too hard. We're tired. It would do us good. We could go to Miami Beach or New Orleans, Hot Springs or Montreal. Why Montreal? Oh, no reason. Nice little town. Might be a nice place to work on that play you're always talking about. Besides, I got some relatives up there and we could get a good home-cooked meal. Hey, Harry, I gave you a bum steer. Jessie is not in Montreal next week, it's Buffalo. Oh, thanks. Well, I got relatives in Buffalo too. <i>I'm sweet Marie from gay Paris</i> <i>This is my new car</i> <i>It fill my heart with joy</i> <i>To drive a Yankee boy</i> <i>On the sly I wink my eye</i> <i>When one come my way</i> <i>I stop the motorcar</i> <i>And then I say</i> <i>Come on, papa</i> <i>Hop in the motorcar</i> <i>Sit by mama</i> <i>And hold the hand</i> <i>You start to raise for me</i> <i>What they call the deuce</i> <i>I'll be so sweet to you</i> <i>Like the charlotte russe</i> <i>Come on, papa</i> <i>Beneath the shining star</i> <i>Bounce your baby</i> <i>Upon the knee</i> <i>I give you the kiss</i> <i>Like the mamselles do</i> <i>Each time you ask for one</i> <i>I give you two</i> <i>And when you're in the car</i> <i>You love mama</i> <i>Ooh la la, ooh la la</i> <i>Come on, papa</i> <i>We make love to you</i> <i>Like you want us to</i> <i>But if you pooh-pooh me</i> <i>I pooh-pooh you</i> <i>But when you're in the car</i> <i>Don't go too far</i> - <i>Ooh la la</i> - <i>Ooh la la</i> <i>Come on, papa</i> Thank you. Thank you. And for my next number. Ladies and gentlemen we have two very well-known songwriters with us tonight. Mr. Bert Kalmar and Mr. Harry Ruby. Would you like to hear them sing one of their numbers? - Hello, Jess. - Hello, Bert. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Jessie. Well, what shall we do? "Nevertheless"? Yeah. <i>Maybe I'm right</i> <i>And maybe I'm wrong</i> <i>And maybe I'm weak</i> <i>And maybe I'm strong</i> <i>But nevertheless</i> <i>I'm in love with you</i> <i>Maybe I'll win</i> <i>And maybe I'll lose</i> <i>And maybe I'm in</i> <i>For cryin' the blues</i> <i>But nevertheless</i> <i>I'm in love with you</i> - <i>Somehow I know at a glance</i> - <i>Somehow I know at a glance</i> - <i>The terrible chances I'm taking</i> - <i>The terrible chances I'm taking</i> - <i>Fine at the start</i> - <i>Fine at the start</i> - <i>Then left with a heart that is breaking</i> - <i>Then left with a heart that is breaking</i> <i>Maybe I'll live a life of regret</i> <i>And maybe I'll give</i> <i>Much more than I get</i> <i>But nevertheless</i> <i>I'm in love with you</i> What's he gonna do, go back in vaudeville? Yeah. Hold it, Harry! - Harry, wait! - Wait! Early riser, huh? Ducked out without saying goodbye. Guys, you both shouldn't have done this. - You're on your honeymoon. - Here's some candy. - Oh, thanks, Bert. - And a little fruit. Oh, well, that will come in handy. I like a little fruit once in a while. Do you mind if I kiss the bride? Bye, Harry. And thanks for everything. You know what I mean. Oh, here, from me to you. Well, now, thanks. You shouldn't have done that. - I wanted to. - Oh, here's some newspapers. And read a book sometime. It might improve your brain. All aboard! Well. We wrote a lot of good songs together, didn't we, Bert? - We sure did, Harry. - Well, bye, Jessie. - Bye, Harry. - Bert. Bye, kid. And good luck to both of you. - Good luck to you, kid. - Don't forget to write. Yeah, I'll keep in touch with your bookings through <i>Variety</i>. - So long. - Bye-bye. Not so very hungry this morning, sir? - No, I'll just have some more coffee. - And a couple of doughnuts. - Yeah, a couple of doughnuts. - Yes, sir. - Harry. - You alone? Why don't you join us? Well, you're in Buffalo. We canceled Buffalo, we're going on a honeymoon. Toast, Bert? Thanks. We've also canceled Syracuse and Rochester and 40 weeks next season. That's a long honeymoon. Where are you going, up the Congo? We might buy a little house somewhere and settle down. - How about Pelham, Bert? - Pelham's nice. Coffee, dear? - Yes, warm it. - Well, what about the team? Yeah, what about the team? I don't know. Do you think it should be Kalmar and Ruby or Ruby and Kalmar? Either way. First billing doesn't mean much to songwriters. - Cream, dear? - Yeah, just a little. You mean you're not gonna do the act, that the team's Bert and me? Oh, Jessie, you're wonderful. Look, it's okay to admire my wife. Would you mind taking your elbow out of my butter? Oh, I'm sorry, Bert. Oh, gosh. Wait a minute. Start again, will you? <i>All alone Monday</i> <i>Singin' the blues</i> I'll take it. Here. Pick a card. Any one. - Ten of clubs. - Yeah, that's all right. Oh, just a moment, please. Harry, telephone. Thanks. - Hello? - <i>Girl.</i> Oh, hello, Terry. Yeah, I'm still working. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, sure I do. What? No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Bye. It was a girl. - Really? - We didn't think it was your Uncle Max. - How long has this been going on? - Oh, a couple of months. In fact, we're engaged. Oh, Harry, that's wonderful. She's sweet. I know you'll like her, Jessie. Why, sure we will. - Hi. - Hi, Joe. <i>All alone Monday</i> <i>Singin' the blues</i> Hey, that's our tune. <i>All alone Tuesday</i> <i>Reading the news</i> Say, that redhead's singing our new song. That's Terry. That's Terry? - Harry, she's beautiful. - Wait till you meet her. <i>On the shelf Wednesday</i> <i>Till the dawn comes</i> <i>By myself Thursday</i> <i>Twirlin' my thumbs</i> <i>Friday is my day</i> <i>So I spend Friday all alone</i> <i>On Saturday I</i> <i>Dread the coming of Sunday</i> <i>Monday the week starts anew</i> <i>I'm certain I could endure</i> <i>The week to the end</i> <i>And I am sure</i> <i>The days that I spend</i> <i>Wouldn't be lonely</i> <i>If I were only</i> <i>All alone with you</i> <i>On Saturday I</i> <i>Dread the coming of Sunday</i> <i>Monday the week starts anew</i> <i>I'm certain I could endure</i> <i>The week to the end</i> <i>And I am sure</i> <i>The days that I spend</i> <i>Wouldn't be lonely</i> <i>If I were only all alone</i> <i>With you</i> - Hello, honey. - How are you, dear? - Miss Lordel, Mr. and Mrs. Kalmar. - Hello. - Jessie, Bert, Terry. - How do you do? - Hello, Terry. - I'm glad to know all of you. Mr. Kalmar, I wanna tell you about that number of yours, it's just terrif. - It's sensashe. - Thanks. You certainly sang it. Oh, thank you. Of course, Snooky rehearsed me in it. - Snooky? - Snooky. This is Snooky. - Hi, Snooky. - Oh, she calls me Snooky. Isn't he sweet? Oh, I could just eat him up. - Light me, please? - I beg your pardon? - Light me? - Oh, yeah, of course. Sure. Oh, that's terrif. Do you know any more tricks? Yeah. l. I understand congratulations are in order, Miss Lordel. Oh, well, thank you, but I haven't got the part yet. She's trying out for a part in the <i>Follies</i>. - Well, I really meant about you and Harry. - Oh, Harry. I thought you weren't gonna tell anybody yet. They're my best friends, I've got to tell them. Oh, that music. Oh, I've simply got to dance. - Will you? - Sure. Oh, I can't dance in this. Look, I've got to change. Now, you be sitting right there when I get back. You hear? Bye. What do you think of her? Well, she's very peppy, isn't she? Yeah, she's got a lot of life. Boys. That's Phil Goodman I'm sitting with the big theatrical producer. He loved your song and he wants it for his new show. - Yeah? - And that's not all. He wants you to write the whole score. - A Broadway show? - Sure. Words and music by Kalmar and Ruby. Who did it, huh? Who did it? - Let me shake the hand of the man. - Terry. Terry singing our song. That's who did it. Oh, Bert. <i>You're here with me</i> <i>I'm here with you</i> <i>We need no secret rendezvous</i> <i>We'll find romance</i> <i>Where e'er we chance</i> <i>To be</i> <i>The sweetest theme</i> <i>Runs through my dream</i> <i>Each night I seem to see</i> <i>A home for two</i> <i>In view for you</i> <i>And me</i> - She could do the Phyllis part. - Yeah. What is your name again? - Eileen Percy. - Any experience, Miss Percy? - Stock mostly, two seasons. - I'd like you to read something for us. If you can handle lines, I'd say the part's yours. - Thank you. - Mr. Goodman! Mr. Goodman, boy, are we in luck. I just found out that Terry Lordel is available. Terry Lordel? Yeah, that girl at the club the other night. She's just a singer. She can sing. She can act. She can do anything. She'd be great for the Phyllis part. Wouldn't she, Bert? - I don't know, Harry. - Let her read the part, that's all I ask. - When could you get her in? - Anytime. Hey, Terry! Come in here! <i>All alone Monday</i> <i>Singing the blues</i> <i>All alone Tuesday</i> <i>Reading the news</i> <i>Staring and blinking</i> <i>Sitting there thinking</i> <i>All alone</i> <i>On the shelf Wednesday</i> <i>Till the dawn comes</i> <i>By myself Thursday</i> <i>Twirling my thumbs</i> <i>Friday is my day</i> <i>So I spend Friday all alone</i> <i>On Saturday I</i> <i>Dread the coming of Sunday</i> <i>Monday the week starts anew</i> <i>I'm certain I could endure</i> <i>The week to the end</i> <i>And I am sure</i> <i>The days that I spend</i> <i>Wouldn't be lonely</i> <i>If I were only all alone</i> <i>With you</i> You're the understudy, huh? It must be a pretty tough job. You're so anxious to get out there. I wouldn't worry, you'll get your chance. - Well, I've already had my chance. - How's that? Well, I almost had a good part once, but they gave it to someone else. Oh, that's a shame. I wouldn't worry about it. Somebody's bound to get sick some night. - Not her. - No, not Terry. She's plenty healthy. Besides, I won't be here much longer. I'm going out to Hollywood. Well, movies, huh? Well, I wish you all the luck in the world. Thanks. Ever anything I can do, let me know. That's very nice of you, Mr. Ruby. Good night. Good night. - Nice going, Terry. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Kalmar. Snooky. Oh, fine. - How's the third act coming? - It isn't. - I'm worried about him. - Who, Snooky? That girl is all wrong for him. She'll ruin his life. He's pretty crazy about her. He's not responsible. He ought to be chained up someplace. You know, if Harry left town for a while that girl would be engaged to four different fellas within a week. Maybe we could get him out of town. How? Ship him off to boarding school? He's a big boy now. Wears long pants. Could Al Schacht help? Al Schacht? That friend of Harry's, the big-league pitcher. Al Schacht is down in Florida with the team. How could he help? - Well, he could ask Harry. - Wait a minute. I'll get Al to invite Harry down to Florida to work out with the Senators. - Bert, that's exactly what I was saying. - Say, that's an inspiration. Western Union, please. Why didn't I think of it before? I really wouldn't know. - Hey, Al, get a load of this. - Let's see it. Hey, Ruby, take it easy, will you? Come on, Al. Throw a fast one. Well, throw a slow one. - Hey, Harry! - What's the matter? - You all right, huh? - Hey, Harry. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - You all right, Harry? - I feel fine. - How are you feeling there? - Hey. - Come on, I'll get it. - Play ball. Play ball. Hit it! Nice going. Come on, Ruby! You moved it. Lay out. I'll take this one. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Sure you're okay? Harry, want to try it again? - Harry! - Bert. How are you? - You look great. - I feel great. - Had a good time, huh? - A little charley horse there. Where's Terry? Didn't she get my wire? Come here, I got news for you. - She isn't sick? - No. - She's married. - Well, that's good. Married? - When? - Saturday night after the show. Went to Greenwich with a saxophone player. - I guess I shouldn't have left town. - You made a wrong move, son. - Want a drink? - Yeah. - What will it be? - Grape juice, please. Make it two. Not to change the subject but I've been kind of busy while you were away. - Saturday night, huh? - Yeah. Look. - What's this? - Play. My play. I finished it. Oh, swell, Bert. - They went to Greenwich, huh? - Yeah. I want you to read it, Harry. - I'd like your opinion. - Sure. I'm gonna produce it myself. I'm putting up part of the cash. I got a broker from Wall Street putting up the rest. A saxophone player, huh? You're not gonna let this thing throw you. Because if you are, I'm gonna feel terrible. Oh, why should you feel terrible, Bert? You had nothing to do with it. A saxophone player. I haven't slept a wink since I read it. Look, Charlie, I don't know anything about plays but do you think Bert ought to produce this himself? - Nobody else will handle it. - What do you mean? - This script been around to regular producers? - Sure. - What do they say? - Nothing much. A couple of them say it will be a sure-fire flop. Well, did you tell Bert? - You tell him. - Oh, fine. That's all I'd have to do. Look, I'm not worried about the dough he'll lose. I'm thinking of Bert, his pride. He's higher than a kite on this thing, and if it flops, he'll never get over it. - Well, what do you want from me? - I. Look, can Bert handle this without that Wall Street guy? - Not a chance. - Well, then, call him off. Tell him the play is no good. Get him to pull out. Harry, I can't. If Bert is gonna fall on his face, maybe we just better let him. He wouldn't let it happen to me. Look, get that broker on the phone. I'll talk to him myself. What do you mean, he pulled out? - Why would he pull out now? - Bert, please. All I know is that he's out, he doesn't want any part of it. Well, I'm still asking you why. Maybe Mr. Miller just decided he didn't like the play anymore. - Was that it, Charlie? - Yeah, just about. He's a broker. What does he know about plays? Listen, I spent a lot of time on that thing. It's not the first play I've written. I've done six plays. I tore them up because they weren't what I wanted. Now I've got something, I know it. And a broker says it's no good. Oh, I thought it was your first play, Bert. He hasn't talked much about it, but he's worked very hard. Well, I'm no broker, but. Well, anything I've got, you're welcome to, you know that. No, no, no. It's all right, forget it. I gotta go along. I've gotta catch an act at the Fordham. - So long, Bert. - So long, Charlie. - Harry. - I'll see you later, Charlie. Oh, look, Bert. Now, you're not gonna let this thing lick you, are you? Because if you do, it's gonna lick me too. I'd feel awful. Why should you feel awful? Is it your fault a broker doesn't know a good play when he sees it? Try it this way: - That ought to fix it. - I don't think so. - Too many notes. - It's not too many notes. Look. Hey, fellas, can we borrow your piano just a minute? Well, listen. <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i> <i>I wanna be kissed by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>I wanna be kissed by you alone</i> Yeah. Come on. Come with us. <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i> <i>I wanna be kissed by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>Oh, I wanna be kissed by you alone</i> <i>I couldn't aspire</i> <i>To anything higher</i> <i>Than fill a desire</i> <i>To make you my own</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>Oh, I wanna be loved by you alone</i> <i>I couldn't aspire</i> <i>To anything higher</i> <i>Than fill a desire</i> <i>To make you my own</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Don't know the time</i> <i>Day or the season</i> <i>I just know that I'm</i> <i>Losin' my reason</i> <i>By fallin' in love</i> <i>Don't know the time</i> <i>Day or the season</i> <i>I just know that I'm</i> <i>Losin' my reason</i> <i>By fallin' in love</i> <i>And since I'm in love</i> <i>I'm up in the clouds</i> - Harry, what is it? - Hey. What's the matter? Steward said you wanted to see me. - You all right? - Sure, I'm fine. Remember those lyrics you wrote for Jessie? I think I got a tune for them. "Thinking of You." - You wrote it for me, Bert? - Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to surprise you, but not at 2:00 in the morning. I thought you'd be interested. Go ahead, Jessie, sing it. <i>Why is it I spend the day</i> <i>Wake up and end the day</i> <i>Thinking of you?</i> <i>Oh, why does it do this</i> <i>To me?</i> <i>Is it such bliss</i> <i>To be</i> <i>Thinking of you?</i> <i>And when I fall asleep at night</i> <i>It seems</i> <i>You just tiptoe</i> <i>Into all my dreams</i> <i>So I</i> <i>Think of no other one</i> <i>Ever since I've begun</i> <i>Thinking of you</i> Oh, Bert. - Nice tune, Harry. - Oh, Harry, it's wonderful. Thanks. Thank you for the song, Bert. It's beautiful. You know, Harry never wrote a melody like that before. He must be in love or something. Why does he have to be in love? Songwriting is a business. You could write a love song in a subway train. Not a love song like that. You have to feel it. Didn't you? Oh, I think of you once in a while. Thank you, darling. All the same, I still think Harry's in love. Don't be silly. Just because he writes a romantic tune that doesn't mean he has to be Beethoven. Any good songwriter can. Don't look now, but here comes Beethoven. And Capri was impossible. Actually impossible. Pepi, dear, be a good little sweetheart and run along. Al Schacht. Go on home. Back to third. Go on home. Back to third. Go on home. Back to third. Al. Get her up there, Al. Higher. Thank you. - What about you, Harry? - Me? - Yeah. - Give me the ball. All right. Lift her up. Higher. Higher! - Thank you! - Oh, wait a minute. You all right? Yes. Okay. - Ball took a bad hop. - A bad hop. A bad hop. We go to rehearsal in two weeks. What do I tell Sam Harris? The ball took a bad hop? He'll be delighted. You and your baseball. Every time I turn around, you're playing baseball. - That's for kids. Kid stuff! - Well, I suppose magic's for grownups. - What's magic got to do with it? - Here, pick a card. Pick a card. Don't let me see which one you take. Ace of clubs? Right? Correct. Hooray! It's not the same thing at all. We have no regular partnership. - lf one of us breaks this up, it's okay. - It's all right with me too. - Then that's understood! - Okay! Okay, okay! Now, play this thing again. No, don't play it. Sing it. <i>Hooray for Captain Spalding</i> <i>The African explorer</i> <i>Did someone call me schnorrer?</i> - <i>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</i> - <i>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</i> How do you think it's going, Bert? Pretty good so far. - Walk around. See what they're saying. - Okay. - Wonderful first act, Mr. Ruby. - Thank you. Oh, hello. Hello there. You don't remember me, do you? Sure. You. - The understudy in <i>The Ramblers.</i> - That's right. Last time we met, you were on your way to Hollywood. How did you make out? All right? - Pretty well. - All right. Good. Bert and I are thinking about going out. Bert, you remember Miss. - How do you do? - Yes. How are you, Mr. Kalmar? They're figuring on making a movie out of <i>The Ramblers.</i> That's wonderful. You must look me up. We sure will. - They're taking our picture. - Yes. One more, please. Thank you. The show must be okay, they're taking our picture. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. What do you mean, taking our picture? - I don't suppose you know who that is. - Don't you remember her? She was the understudy in <i>The Ramblers.</i> Nice kid. - You ought to see more movies. - Why? Come here, son. See that sign? There's your understudy. She's a movie star? Oh, she must think I'm crazy. Wait a minute. Now, how could anyone possibly think you're crazy? Oh, come on. <i>I love you so much</i> <i>I can't conceal it</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> Yeah, it's all right. It's all right. - You got any other tunes? - Let me see. I got something that'll fit. Of course, you have to take off one word to make it "I love you so." Let's hear it. <i>I love you so</i> <i>I can't conceal it</i> <i>It's a wonder that you don't feel it</i> <i>I love</i>. Harry, cut it out, will you? For the last time, I'm telling you, lay off that tune. What's the matter with it? He's been trying to sell it to me once a week since we met. I can't help it, Bert. I can't think of a title. How can anybody ever think of a title for that thing? - Oh, that's a nice title. - What else can you say? - Play that other thing. - You don't like it. I love it, I'm crazy about it. Play it, will you? Who do you think's gonna be in our picture? - Who? - That understudy. <i>I love you so much</i> <i>I can't conceal it</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>My eyes reveal it</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> <i>I've decided that I am through</i> <i>With all this rambling about</i> <i>I don't know what I'd ever do</i> <i>Without you</i> <i>I'm telling you</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>I can't conceal it</i> <i>I love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> - <i>We love you so much</i> - <i>I don't believe it</i> <i>We can't conceal it</i> <i>We love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> - <i>We love you so much</i> - <i>I can't believe it</i> <i>Our eyes reveal it</i> <i>We love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> <i>Now, I've decided that I am through</i> <i>With all this rambling about</i> <i>We don't know what we'd ever do</i> <i>Without you</i> <i>You're telling me</i> <i>We love you so much</i> - <i>I can't believe it</i> - <i>We can't conceal it</i> <i>We love you so much</i> <i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i> - <i>Because you love me so</i> - <i>Because we love you so</i> Cut! Get a lily. Print three and four. - That was very nice, Eileen. - Thank you. - Sounded swell, Eileen. - Thanks. Don't you ever get tired of watching this? Not the way you do it. You should've been the star in the Broadway version. - Oh, I don't know. - Yes. - You really think so? - Sure. She'd have been great. Why don't you go out and get a cup of coffee? - Who wants coffee? - Coffee's good for you sometimes. My crazy friend Kendall The Great. I mean it. How did we happen to pass you by? - Well, it's a long story. - I'm interested. He's interested. Well, I tried out for the part. It was practically all set. And a fellow brought in another girl. A very pretty girl. - He was a songwriter. - Named Snooky? - That's right. - Snooky? Whoever heard of a songwriter named. Snoo. Me? Oh, you mean that girl l. You're a magician. Make me disappear. <i>I can't forget</i> <i>The night we met</i> - It looks lovely, Lennie. - Thank you. I'll let you know when to light it and bring it in. <i>The moon lit up the sky</i> <i>And love lit up your eye</i> <i>I kissed you once</i> <i>I kissed you twice</i> <i>And I held you gently</i> <i>That night upon</i> <i>The shores of Araby</i> - All right, so I wrote a lyric once. - Oh, no, you didn't. "My Sunny Tennessee" was a great song. This is a very happy, happy anniversary. Happy days. - Get our boy here. - I'm celebrating with my friends. You know, this is the third time in my life I've had more than one drink. - Very interesting. - Yes, it is. Come here, Charlie. Very interesting. - I didn't say anything wrong. - No, you said nothing at all. Well, it's a great privilege to be with you boys tonight. And I mean that. - And I can say it in this room. - It's a nice room. You fellows have written lots of songs together. But more than that, you've been friends. That's the most important thing in the world, are friends. - Shall I put some bicarbonate in this? - It wouldn't hurt. You know, you've got a friend, and you've got a friend. And that's what I'd like to see. Friends. Very funny. We'll spot it in our next picture. - Here. - Hey, look at that, huh? Here, drink this. Hey, I was just thinking. The time Harry called Tony Miller. You said, "Mr. Miller, if you back that play you're gonna be the brokest broker that ever stepped on Broadway." - Remember? - Yeah. What play was that? Your play. You wrote it. And your friend got you out of it. And we went up to see him. And when we told you I will never forget the expression on your face as long as I live. Believe me, I'll never forget it. Oh, hey, Bert, that was a long time ago. I think I better get some coffee. Charlie's got the talkers. Just kidding, huh? No, I always meant to tell you about it, Bert but I just never got around to it. I can understand that. What was on your mind, Harry, when you crabbed that deal for me? - What do you think? - I'm asking. Well, I didn't want you to flop. That play wasn't too good, Bert. You decided that. Oh, why not? You're an expert. Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna pull a peeve after all these years. - What do you expect me to do? - All right, I was wrong. I just didn't want you to get hurt. That's very touching. Well, why else would I do it? Whatever the reason, you had a sweet nerve. What do you mean, "whatever the reason"? All I know is I wanted something very much. And now I find out my partner did me out of it. Well, I told you why, I was worried. About me or yourself? Oh, sure. Now I get it. You think I didn't want you to have that play. I was scared the play might click and bust up our partnership and I couldn't lean on you anymore. Is that what you meant? If I believed that, I couldn't be any sorer than I am now. But you do believe it. You must think I needed you pretty badly. You must have thought so. Not that badly. Look, I'm not forgetting anything. I know what I was when I ran into you: A song-plugger. But even without you, I might have gotten somewhere. It's just possible. All by myself. It's not too late to try. Harry. Bert. Come on, it's time to cut the cake. Come on. Everybody's waiting. Harry. Bert. - Come on. - Make a wish. - Make a wish. - Make a wish, come on. Hello, hello. Bert? Marty. Say, some of the boys down here got ahold of a screwy item for tomorrow's issue. Listen: "Kalmar and Ruby split. Songwriting team are calling it quits after a long and successful partnership. Understood Kalmar will devote his time to stories and screenplay writing." Say, will you tell the boys they're crazy? Okay, Bert. Sorry. Print it. Nice tune. - Have you got any lyrics for it? - No. No words. Ever hear from Bert? No. He's writing those scripts. Doing real well, they tell me. You know, Bert's really a smart fella. Oh, that's nice too. That's one of the nicest melodies you've ever written, Harry. It's always been my favorite. <i>It seems</i> <i>You just tiptoe</i> <i>Into all my dreams</i> <i>So I</i> <i>Think of no other one</i> <i>Ever since I've begun</i> <i>Thinking of you</i> It's different from the rest. You must've been very much in love when you wrote this one. Well. You wanna know something? I think I wrote it too soon. - Morning. - Morning, Jess. - Been working all night? - Most of it. There's a review of your picture in here. - Oh, what did they say? - You're a big man this morning. "The story by Bert Kalmar is thoroughly enjoyable. The dialogue neat and deftly turned." - How's that? - Let me see it. I love good notices. Hey, did you see this? They flew to Yuma last night. She's a very nice girl, Bert. Yeah. Well, we didn't have to wire Al Schacht this time, did we? You didn't eat a thing. I wasn't hungry. - Just tired, huh? - Oh, a little bit. <i>You are my lucky star</i> <i>I saw you from afar</i> And so, ladies and gentlemen we bring to a close another issue of <i>The Songwriters' Parade.</i> <i>Tonight's honored guests were</i> <i>Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.</i> <i>We'll be back again next week</i> <i>to pay tribute once again.</i> <i>. to the men</i> <i>who write America's songs.</i> <i>At that time we'll be happy to present</i> <i>as our guests.</i> <i>. Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.</i> Is that Phil Regan out of his mind or something? I don't know. Whoever told him to announce a thing like that? A personal appearance. - There's nothing so terrible about it. - Nothing so terrible? A radio show with two people who don't talk to each other? - I wanna get that Regan on the phone. - No. You can't do that. - Why not? - Because. If Phil Regan was nice enough to think of you the least you can do is to be there. I'll take that. He ought to know better than to announce a thing like that without checking first. What kind of a business is this? - Kalmar and Ruby, he said. - Hello? - Kalmar and Ruby. - Oh, hello, Eileen. Like we were brothers or something. - Well, I don't know. - That doesn't mean I have to go. - He ought to stop thinking. - How's it going at your house? - Well, hold on. - This will be a great show. Great. How can they do a thing like this? I didn't okay it. Tell him to get another voice because I'm not gonna be there. Bert won't be there either. What do they expect me to do play the piano while Bert makes a microphone disappear? It's a little early to tell yet, Jessie. I know what you mean. Keep your fingers crossed. Who told them to do it? Who put them up to it? - lf they ever find out that we did this. - What kind of routine are we supposed to do? An argument for the benefit of our audience? Look, Eileen, I'll call you back later. We're on the air, boys, shake hands. Come out fighting. Oh, come on, Harry. Ah, this whole thing's silly. I don't like it, Eileen. Oh, I know. In a way it is embarrassing. But after all, Regan was nice enough to think of you. The very least you can do is be there. - Eileen, Harry! - Jessie, how are you? How are you, Eileen? You look wonderful. I'll take your hat. - Hello, Bert. - Hello, Eileen. - Hi. - Hi. - Pull up a stool. - Oh, thanks. Well, it looks like we're stuck with this thing. I guess so. Got any ideas what we might do? I found one of the old routines. It might be okay. That thing we did at the Friars, remember? Sure. Oh, sure. Sure. This is okay. Want to rehearse? Oh, I know the music. You know the words? Yeah, I know the words. Well, I guess we don't have to rehearse. I guess not. Well, I'll see you tomorrow night, I guess. I guess so. Oh, say. I caught your picture the other night. Nice job. It's all right, I guess. I hear you've been knocking out good tunes lately. Oh, I've been kicking it around a little. You got anything? Sure. Sure, I've got one little tune I've been working on. Of course, you won't like it. - What won't I like? - What I got. - I haven't heard it yet. - Okay. - Sounds vaguely familiar. - Well, I told you you wouldn't like it. I never said that. It's a nice tune, a very nice tune. You never got a title for it, huh? No, in fact, never did. There was "La-Da-Dee-Da" and "Beep-Beep-A-Deep." That's about all we got. Let's see. We ought to get something for a tune like that. Play that first part, will you? <i>Oh me, oh my</i> No. That's no good. You know, that's not a bad tune. - I could've been wrong about it. - Well, you usually weren't. Well, let me see. <i>I love you so</i> No, that's that thing we had before. We'll get it. We'll get something. Yeah, we'll get it. Do you want to work on it? We could knock it off this afternoon. - Okay. Let's knock it off. - All right. I can't this afternoon. I just remembered there's a double-header at Wrigley Field. It's not that I wanna go. You see, I promised a fella. - I see. Baseball is more important. - No. No, I'll work with you tonight. All night if you want to. All right, if you want to. No, wait a minute, I can't. I've got a meeting tonight. The magician's club. The magician's club? - Yeah. - You've gotta do tricks, huh? - No, I don't gotta do tricks. - Yeah, you gotta make rabbits disappear. No, I don't have to make rabbits disappear. I'm the president. - Well, hooray! - Yeah, hooray. You should talk. The nation's number one baseball fan. - "Take him out. Take him out." - Now it's my fault. - I was willing to work. - You don't want to work. - You never wanted to work. - What do you mean? Every time I wanna do something, you're catching flies. - Don't talk about me. - I'll talk about you. What about you, that sleight-of-hand stuff? That dangling ropes in the air, pulling cigars out of your ears? - Yeah? - That's important for kids. - For kids? - Yeah, for kids! I better get him out of here. This is what I've been waiting for. Come, sit down. Keep your voice down. I didn't wanna work, he says. What about you? I wouldn't write that song if you begged me. - Begged you? I didn't even ask you. - I guess you just can't help it, Harry. I feel sorry for you. You feel sorry for me? You must think I'm just. I can tell you what I think of you in three little words: You're a dope! "You're a dope." Bert called me three little words, "You're a dope." <i>You are a dope</i> <i>Three little words</i> <i>Three little words</i> It fits. Hey, Bert! Bert! This is my house. Why should I walk out? - You got it, Bert, the title of the song. - What? "Three Little Words." You got it. You better hurry. You might miss the baseball game. Oh, anytime you're ready to go, Eileen. I'm ready. - Bye, Jessie. - Bye, Harry. - Bye, Eileen. - Bye, Jessie. Good evening. We're here tonight to pay tribute to two great pals of mine. I know they've turned out many, many hits together. I'm sure you've whistled their tunes and danced to their tunes but I know you're gonna get a big kick out of meeting them in person tonight. None other than Bert Kalmar and. And Harry Ruby. - Hello, Harry. Bert, how are you? - How are you, Phil? Here they are, ladies and gentlemen, going to sing a medley of their hit tunes. <i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i> <i>In my Dixie paradise</i> <i>An angel's voice I hear</i> <i>I mean my mammy dear</i> And then we wrote. - <i>Who's sorry now?</i> - <i>Who's sorry now?</i> - <i>Who's sorry now?</i> - <i>Who's sorry?</i> - <i>I tried to warn you somehow</i> - <i>I tried to warn you somehow</i> And then came. <i>I wanna be loved by you</i> <i>Just you and nobody else but you</i> <i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i> And then we sat down and wrote. <i>Why is it I spend the day</i> <i>Wake up and end the day</i> <i>Thinking of you?</i> And then we stood up and wrote. <i>So long, Oo-long</i> <i>How long you going to roam?</i> <i>Please don't be too long</i> <i>Oo-long, so long</i> <i>Hurry back home</i> <i>Maybe I'm right</i> <i>And maybe I'm wrong</i> <i>And maybe I'm weak</i> <i>And maybe I'm strong</i> <i>But nevertheless</i> <i>I'm in love with you</i> <i>Maybe I'll win</i> <i>And maybe I'll</i>. Oh, that's enough of that. How would you like to hear a brand-new song? One we just wrote yesterday. Well, not exactly yesterday. As a matter of fact, it took us about 10 years. Phil, if you please? <i>Three little words</i> <i>Oh, what I'd give for</i> <i>That wonderful phrase</i> <i>To hear those</i> <i>Three little words</i> <i>That's all I'd live for</i> <i>The rest of my days</i> <i>And what I feel in my heart</i> <i>They tell sincerely</i> <i>No other words</i> <i>Can tell it half so clearly</i> <i>Three little words</i> <i>Eight little letters</i> <i>Which simply mean</i> <i>I love you</i> Wonderful, Bert, wonderful.

Why not? <i>You're not the kind of guy to be at a place</i> <i>like this, at this time in the morning.</i> <i>But here you are.

Got some blow? - I love drugs! - That's something we have in common. Have you ever noticed how the good words start with D? D and L. Drugs. Delight. Decadence. - Debauchery. - Dexedrine. Delectable.

OK, I'm coming in. <i>The "Post" is the most shameful</i> <i>of your several addictions.</i> <i>You're a secret fan of killer bees,</i> <i>hero cops, sex fiends, lottery winners,</i> <i>teenage terrorists, Liz Taylor, tough tots,</i> <i>sicko creeps, living nightmares,</i> <i>life on other planets, spontaneous</i> <i>human combustion. coma babies.</i> - Morning. Thanks. - Hi. Morning. - Morning. - Morning. Good morning. Tardy, tardy, very tardy. Good morning, Mr Conway. May I speak to you in my office? Close the door. How nice to see you, Jamie. Thank you, Clara. Nice to see you. I wasn't sure you were keeping office hours any more. Sit down. Mr Vogel has decided to move the French piece up an issue. That means I need it on my desk before you leave today. - Is that clear? - Quite clear. I want every single fact verified as per standard procedure. I want the spelling of every name double-checked, I want every accent in place, I want every figure correct. If the writer gives the population of France, find the exact figure - man, woman and child - down to the last baby born, the hour we go to press. Is that clear? Crystalline. Because if there is one single mistake in that article, whose fault will it be? The writer's fault? - My fault. - Exactly. And if I were you, I would be on the phone to Paris <i>now,</i> where it is five in the afternoon and everyone is thinking of going home. We know from your résumé that you're fluent in French, so this will be no problem for you. Absolutely. No problem. My desk. My ass. What? Hello. <i>Vite, vite.</i> <i>Allons-y travailler.</i> Still got that nasty sinus problem, I see. Jamie? Listen, do you want some help with that? - No, Meg, thanks. - I'm not busy. Sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Absolutely. There's a certain shabby nobility in failing all by myself. Hi, Eleanor. Can you get those calls through to Paris for me this morning? Right, yeah. No, the same two ministries. Uh-huh. And I need you to get ahold of John Martin for me. Right. You got that number? Thanks. Richard Rose? Richard <i>B</i> Rose. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Jesus Christ. Hello? <i>- Ne quittez pas.</i> <i>- Monsieur Conway, ne quittez pas.</i> Oh! <i>Ne quittez pas.</i> <i>Ne quittez pas. Oui. Je. Oui.</i> Why did I put French on my résumé? Jamie, you don't speak French? <i>Pardon? Oui.</i> <i>Oui. Je suis Monsieur Jamie Conway</i> <i>des États-Unis.</i> <i>- Oui, alors.</i> <i>- Oui.</i> <i>Je. Je travaille sur la.</i> essay. <i>politique.</i> Shit. I mean, <i>merde.</i> <i>Pardon?</i> - Uh. Hello? - <i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i> Hello? Line went dead. Mr Vogel. May I help you? No, thank you. - Clara? - Hello, Mr Vogel. - Headache? - Yeah. Um. I need to go to the deli, get a little nourishment. - Want anything? - I'd love a cheese Danish. - All right. Anybody else want anything? - No, thank you. - Last chance. - No, thanks. Megan, if anybody calls, I'll be right back. Mr Tyler. How's the travel section? Ah, fine, fine. Big piece on Tibet this week. So how's that beautiful wife of yours? She's fine. She's in Paris, modelling. Really? I'm sure I saw her modelling clothes on a TV talk show this weekend. No, it must have been a rerun. - I'd know if she was in town. - Yeah, you'd certainly hope so. So how's Clara behaving? Same as usual, like a fourth-grade tyrant. I always wanted to ask somebody, in fact. does Clara piss in the men's room or the ladies'? - I don't believe she pisses. - Marvellous! So how do you like it down here, in fact? All in all, I'd rather be in fiction. - You write, don't you? - It seems to be a matter of opinion. Read Hazlitt, that's my advice. Read Hazlitt and write before breakfast every day. - OK, what can I do you for? - Pastrami on rye. - A little mustard today, Jamie? - Yeah, mustard. Mustard and butter. And butter. Just like your mother made it, huh? <i>- What do you know about it?</i> <i>- That's how my mother used to make it.</i> - That is just so unbelievable. - Listen, I took two messages for you. One from Monsieur Something at the department of something. And one from your brother Michael. - Really? - Yeah. He said it was urgent. All right. - Is Vogel still in there? - Yeah. Hm. I wonder what's going on. - <i>Allô?</i> - <i> Practising our French, are we?</i> No, excuse me, ma'am. I thought it was my call from Paris. <i>Could you spare a moment</i> <i>to see me in my office?</i> Sure. I'm about to find out. Yes? Close the door. - Mr Vogel. - Good afternoon. - Something wrong? - Did you verify the facts in this article? "Precipitate" or "precipitous"? Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes, I remember. Mr Vogel called me up and expressed his concern about the president's correct usage of the English language. In this piece, the president warns against "precipitous action". Mr Vogel felt that "precipitate" was the word that he was looking for. - Correct. - Go on. Well, I called the White House. I tried to explain to them the importance of the distinction, and I spent several hours on hold. So, finally, with the composing room and everybody screaming for the final pages, I checked with <i>Webster's Third Edition,</i> which listed them as synonymous. - The third edition? - Yeah. I know that the second edition gives different meanings for the words, but the third edition's a lot racier. Hello? <i>- John Martin for you.</i> - Hello, John Martin. Jamie Conway here. <i>- We got a connection here? Hello?</i> - Jamie. <i>Gotham</i> magazine. Right. I'm checking facts on that piece you wrote about the French elections. - <i>I think you can go with that, Jamie.</i> - That's great. It's really good. Right. Where did you get this about the French government and Paramount Pictures? No. John. No, I can't run a line through that. The next three paragraphs depend on it. - No, I just need to know if it's true or not. - <i>He's very well connected.</i> You heard it where? - At a fucking cocktail party? - <i>Come on, Jamie.</i> - <i>I gotta go.</i> - No! No, don't hang up. <i>- Hold on.</i> - All right, get the door. I'll hold. Just call me back, all right? This is gonna take all night. Jamie, I want it on my desk before you leave. I've left my door unlocked. - Jimmy. Good to see you. - Mr Allagash. How are you? Good. A vodka on the rocks, and can I borrow your phone? - You got it. - Thank you. Hello? Hello? What are you doing at the office? Monstrous events are scheduled. <i>What happened to you Saturday? I had</i> <i>to walk home. I couldn't pay for a cab.</i> - I left. - <i>Yeah, I know.</i> I took this bimbo back to her place. Did some of her off-the-boat quality drugs. We scooped it out of these Ming vases, did it off each other's naked bodies. - It was fucking beautiful, man. - Bullshit. - <i>No, it's true.</i> - God, I hate you. Let me tell you about tonight. Elaine and Theresa are dying to meet you. Theresa's father owns an oil company. Elaine is soon to be in a major TV commercial. And I think I have cornered a big chunk of Bolivia's national product. I'm gonna be working most of the night. Then I'm gonna go home and sleep. Give me a time. I'll pick you up. Call me in half an hour. I gotta finish this. - I'll see you in a while. Bye-bye. - <i>Bye.</i> Thanks a lot, Jimmy. There you go, Clara. Read it and weep. Good night. # <i>It's all right, pretty baby</i> # <i>Gonna need my help someday</i> # <i>Whoa, it's all right, pretty baby</i> "He was expecting her on the afternoon flight from Paris when she called to say she would not be coming home."

We're soliciting donations for children without drugs. - Would you open the door, please? - Yeah. One minute. Hang on, Tad. - Ready to roll? The giris are waiting. - Where are we rolling to? Into the heart of the night. Wherever there are dances to be danced, drugs to be hoovered, women to be Allagashed. It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. - Speaking of drugs, you in possession? - Negative. - Not even a single line for young Tad? - Sorry. - Not even a mirror to lick? - Jesus. Help yourself. Where the fuck did you get this? I inherited that from my grandmother. Oh, Christ. I gotta change this shirt. - There's something on here. - Yeah, that's dust, Tad. It's probably got better coke content than some of the shit we buy by the gram. D'you know that 90 of household dust is composed of human epidermal matter? - That's skin to you. - That's why I'm thinking about Amanda. She left her skin behind. Doing a little writing, are we? Yeah! "Dead Amanda." I told you you'd get more nooky if you just told people your wife was dead. - I hit the wrong key. - It's the sympathy vote that counts. It's a lot better than saying she fit you with horns and kited off to Paris. Are you sure you have no drugs? I think there's some Robitussin in the bathroom. I'm disappointed in you, coach. I figured you for the kind of guy who saves something for a rainy day. - I've fallen in with bad companions. - Maybe Amanda died in a plane crash. She was coming home from Paris on the day of your first anniversary. That's fuckin' beautiful. Come on, Warner. Answer the goddamn phone. Shit! I know that asshole's sitting in his loft on top of a pile of toot, ignoring the phone. It's 11 o'clock. It's a little early for Odeon, but once we're downtown, it'll be happy hunting ground for sneeze and squeeze. Do you ever have an overwhelming desire to just spend a quiet evening at home? No! - Elaine. Theresa. - Hi. - This is Jamie Conway. - Hi. - Hi, Jamie. - Hi. How are you? - Aren't you Amanda White's boyfriend? - Husband. Yeah, I was. You didn't hear? She was in Paris and got hit by a burst of terrorist crossfire. Palestinians, French police. A real fluke thing. Senseless death. She was an innocent bystander. Jamie doesn't like to talk about it. - That's terrible. - Yeah. A tragedy. I have to take care of some business, but you'll take care of him? - Is that true? - Not really, no. What is Amanda doing these days? She's in Paris doing the Oscar de la Renta collection. - Wait a minute. Is she alive? - We sort of split up. Too bad for you. She was yummy. Sort of the slinky girl-next-door look. Very ingenuous. - I don't understand this. - Neither do I. - Aren't you a writer? - I do some writing. More of an editor. <i>Gotham</i> magazine. God, I've been reading it all my life. I mean, my parents get it. I read it at the gynaecologist. What's your name again? Should I know you? I haven't been published yet, but they have a couple of my short stories. Got my fingers crossed. Matter of time. Don't you want a drink? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. Too late. Bingo. Seems like I spend about half my life in bathrooms. - Hey, Bruno. Two vodkas. - You got it. Hey, Jamie. Hey, Rich. - Rich, when'd you get back? - I can't hear you. Where's Amanda? I'm sorry. That's terrible. Jamie, I'm so sorry. Two Stolis on the rocks. Here we go. Did you have the vodka or the vodka? - No margarita? - No margarita. Vodka. - Vodka. - Thanks. Jamie! What did you say to them? What? What did you say to Rich and Kathy? I told them Amanda died of leukaemia. - What? - I told them Amanda died of leukaemia. That's not funny. My mom died of cancer. Jamie. I'm sorry. - What was that about? - I just said something in really bad taste. Oh, Jamie. I'm so sorry about Amanda. She was such a pretty girl and you made a great couple. It's all right, Kathy. She's not dead. - What? She's not dead? - No, she's not dead. He's pulling your leg. She's in Paris. Oh. - She's doing a shoot. - Oh. - Well, did you break up or something? - Sort of. Maybe. I don't know. Oh. Wanna dance? - No, not right now. Maybe later? - OK. All right. Later. - I tried. - Where are the giris? Bathroom. - Without me? - I guess so. - You gonna come? - No, I'll catch you on the rebound. Excuse me, ladies. Coming in. Hi. How you doin'? Fine. All right.

What do <i>you</i> want? - You gonna come out? - No way, José. I like it in here. Everything I need is pumped in. Mom's on her way out. Hey, if the old lady goes, then I'm going with her. - Don't be like that. - # I can't hear you # I can't hear you Come out. Listen to me, you've gotta come out. Open up. It's the doctor. They're <i>never</i> gonna take me alive. Hello? <i> Jamie?</i> <i>Oui.</i> <i>Hi, it's Megan. I just wanted</i> <i>to make sure you were awake.</i> Oh, yeah? Are you kidding me, Megan? I'm making breakfast. I'm making sausage and eggs. <i>I hope you don't mind, but I didn't want</i> <i>you getting in Dutch with Clara again.</i> She's not here yet, but I wanted to make sure you were awake. <i>- You sure you're awake?</i> - Certainly feels like it. Headache. Queasy stomach. All the vital signs. I'll be right there. TUESDAY You should have called in sick. I'll get it. Hello? Michael, hello. No, he's not here yet, but I expect him any minute. He didn't get back to you yesterday? I told him you called. Yes, absolutely. I'll tell him. - Morning. - You just missed your brother. You should call him right away. It sounds important. - Where's Clara? - Still not here. I just had a call from Clara. She's sick. She won't be in today. - Nothing fatal, I hope. - I'm to distribute the assignments. - Did you finish the French piece? - More or less. If she's not coming in, maybe I can take one last look, make sure it's OK. She had it sent over to typesetting. She even had a photocopy messengered to her apartment. Jeez. Why does she hate me so much? It's not my fault she never got married. - I think she's determined to get me fired. - Not possible. The magazine has a tradition of never acknowledging its mistakes. - She's not gonna fire you, Jamie. - I'm not so sure. Mm. She's got a heart like a 12-minute egg. Let's see now. First in a long series on cancer research. Megan. <i>An inventor who's received his hundredth</i> <i>patent for a nose-hair clipping device.</i> Yasu. Here's an amusing one for you, Jamie. A meeting of the Society of Polar Explorers at the Sherry-Netherland. All right, good. So there was such an event. Uh-huh. And you did serve smoked emperor penguin on Triscuits. Great. Wait, one more thing. Yeah. Uh. Is it true that somebody wore a headdress made out of walrus skin? God, I'll be damned. No, that's it. Great. Thanks. Bye. All right. Facts are stranger than fiction. OK. Polar explorer piece is put to bed. I'm gonna grab a bite. Anybody want anything? - I'd love a bagel. Toasted. No butter. - You would. Bagel, toasted, no butter. Afternoon. Mr Hardy? I was just thinking it could use some fish. All water coolers could use some fish. The old crew in the great days of this magazine would have thought of it. Siamese fighting fish in the water cooler. What's your name now? I know. It's on the tip of my tongue. - Jamie Conway. - Jamie Conway! Jamie Conway. Didn't you send a story to us in the fiction department? Yeah. Yes. Yes, several months ago. - Did you read it? - Oh, yes. A lower-case Scott Fitzgerald without the crackup. I guess you could say that, yeah. You got a cough. Here. I knew Fitzgerald's friend, Bunny Wilson, you know. Yeah, I know. The only great American man of letters. - Where are you headed? - I was going out to lunch. Good. I'll join you. Refresh my memory. What's it about? A young writer goes to Kansas City, meets a beautiful girl. They marry, come to New York City, she models. They start going out, start doing drugs. Very interesting style. Very interesting sense of story. Good sense of character, a sense of place. I assume it's autobiographical. Ah! Phew. - A couple more, please. - I'm still nursing this one. It reminds me of the kind of stuff I used to write when I was a kid. I started off as office boy at the magazine. I got published every so often. I used to write satirical sketches on Manhattan highlife. I know. I used to read that stuff. Amazing. Yeah. A lot more fun than being an editor. All I do as an editor is read a lot of undisciplined, untalented crap. - Your table's ready. - Thanks. Don't forget the two drinks. Come on, right over here. This way. So what are you working on now? I'm. thinking about writing a novel. I've been making some notes. I'm just having a hard time actually sitting down and writing. My wife left me, so. It sounds corny, but I've been doing a lot of suffering. Have you ever considered getting an MBA? - Absolutely not. - I'm not saying go into business. No, but write about it. That's the stuff. Right now, the guys who understand business will be writing the new literature. Money is poetry now. I don't want to believe that. It may be true, but, no, I don't want to believe that. Don't be seduced by all that crap about garrets and art, like I was. Write about money. A couple more! I knew some of the giants. I knew Bill Faulkner. Yeah, we had a lot of fun. We used to go to Musso's and get pissed for lunch and roar around. Talk about everything under the sun. Women, life, death, art. but most of all we talked about work. About commitment. - About not selling out. - I gotta go. - No! Have one more for the road. - No, I can't, Alex. I can't. So you think I've got some talent? - I'm not just wasting my time? - How do I know? One little story - I can't tell from one little story. Anyone can write one little story. - Let me. - No, save it. This is on me. It's all right. Thanks. Amanda. Amanda. - Amanda! - In here. Amanda. Sorry I took so long. It's pouring. I couldn't get a cab. That's OK. Here. - It's OK. We're just starting. - Here. Put this all over your face. This is my husband Jamie, the writer I was telling you about. - This is Luigi. - How you doin'? And Lucas. Just the head? I thought it was the body. I was looking forward to seeing you lying naked in a vat of latex batter. No, just my head. - Wait a minute, how do I breathe? - We'll put straws in your nose. Sounds familiar. I didn't know you were gonna stay that long. You never said you'd be that long. I checked the messages. There's a party at Magique tonight. And your agent called. She said that your flight leaves at ten tomorrow. And she said that you should be prepared to stay the full two weeks. You never said anything about staying that long. I didn't hear about that. - - You OK? What's the matter? Amanda? - She's OK. - Hey, Amanda. - You OK? - She's OK. Don't be scared. - All right. Fine. Are you all right? - Mm-hm. I love you. Just relax, OK? Relax. <i>It's OK. Amanda? I love you.</i> She's back. She's in town. Click Modeling Agency. May I help you? This Andrew Carrington, the photographer. I'm in town and interested in working with Amanda White. Is she in New York? Yes. She's doing the Oscar de la Renta show at the Parsons School of Design - Thursday afternoon. - Marvellous. Terrific. Thanks. - Yeah? - <i>Mr Conway's on the line.</i> - I'll take it. Jamie. - <i>I gotta talk to you. Meet me at Cybelle's.</i> - I'm really busy. - <i>You gotta meet me.</i> - What's the matter? - I'll explain when I see you. Just be there. Camellia, I'm gonna take the rest of the afternoon off. How you doin'? Double vodka, please. - Hey. What's the big deal? - I need a favour. That's funny, so do I. What you drinking? - Double vodka. - The same, please. Thanks. You go first. What's yours? Tonight, I have a very steamy engagement with the glorious Inge. - Which one is Inge? - The aspiring actress. - New York is full of aspiring actresses. - Yeah, well, Inge was also Miss August. - <i>Penthouse</i> Miss August? - You got it. - The one with the parrot? - That's Inge. Unfortunately, my cousin Vicky is in town today. She's a grad student at Princeton. She's on some academic gig at NYU. I promised her I'd pick her up early, take her to dinner. This is where you gotta help me out. - Why do I envision a prig with glasses? - Hey, hey. She's an Allagash. She has Allagash genes. She's a very attractive lady. She'll also inherit a little Allagash money. That's all right. Can't let me down, coach. Anything I possess, including some of Bolivia's finest, is yours. All right. OK, I'll tell you what. I'll have dinner with your canine cousin. Good. .if you get me into the Oscar de la Renta show at Parsons Art School, Thursday. Amanda's in town. She's working that show. I know. OK. Excuse me? You wouldn't happen to be Vicky, would you? Allagash's cousin? - Yeah. Hi. - Hi. Jamie. - He told you, right? - He did. Good. Right. - Sorry I'm so late. - It's OK. I was looking around. - This is a great bookstore. - Yeah. It's a little early for dinner. You wanna do something? You wanna get a drink? - All right. - We could just go for a walk. All right. - Where are you from? - Up near Marblehead. Allagash country. - How about you? - Bucks County. Your parents? They divorced three years ago. Yours? - A happy marriage. - You're lucky. - Any brothers or sisters? - Yeah, I have a brother. I have a brother too. - So what did Tad tell you about me? - Not much. Not much. What did he say? He raved. He tried to build you up. I was expecting a field hockey player with thick glasses and lockjaw. What did he tell you about me? - Not much. - Come on. He said you were a cross between a young F Scott Fitz-Hemingway and the later Wittgenstein. - That's it? Nothing else? - Nothing else. Tad is a great guy. Tad is a helluva guy. You gotta admire his style, his <i>joie de</i> <i>vivre,</i> his savoir-faire, his <i>sprezzatura.</i> He's not necessarily the man for a heart-to-heart, but he. He's been a good friend to me in a time of need and. And he's generous in his own careless way. Are you two close? - I think he's an ass. - Exactly. I gotta go and wash my hands. I'll be right back. Let's see if it's possible to get through the evening without chemicals for a change. Tell me about your job. I guess I'm supposed to be impressed. Don't be. I don't like it much and they don't like me, so it works out. I know people who would <i>kill</i> for a job like that. Actually, it's pretty tedious. When I first started, I thought it would be my first step towards literary glory, and it was just a matter of time before I joined the roster of famous writers. All I do is pore over encyclopaedias, dictionaries and government pamphlets. It's not very creative. I've only just met you, but that doesn't really seem like your kind of job to me. Yeah, I don't think it is. Well, I've really gotta go now. This is my car. Oh. I wish you didn't. Yeah, me too. - You have my number, right? - Right. You should call me. Yeah, I'd like to. Drive safe. WEDNESDAY You should have checked your horoscope in THE POST. - Jamie. - Hey. Clara's in a rage. She says the French piece is a mess, but it's too late to pull it from the issue. - She said it was a mess? - Yep. She's got Vogel in her office right now. How bad could it be? You got most of it done, didn't you? I really don't know. - She said it was a mess? - A mess. I would like to see you in my office immediately. She said it was a mess. I would like to know what happened. I screwed up? You screwed up. May I be so bold as to ask for a little elaboration? Really, I'm interested. Just how did you screw up, exactly? Well? Do you realise just how serious this is? You have endangered the reputation of this magazine. We have built a reputation for scrupulous accuracy with regard to matters of fact. Do you know that in 50 years of publication there has been only one printed retraction? Can I ask what errors you found exactly? Two accents reversed. An electoral district in Central France, incorrectly identified as Northern. A minister ascribed to the wrong department. This is just what I've found so far. I'm scared to death of what I'll uncover. The proofs are a mess. I can't tell what you have or haven't verified. The point is, you have not followed standard procedure which should be second nature to you, which procedure is thoroughly outlined in your manual, which procedure is the net result of years of collective labour, and the proper application of which ensures that, in so far as possible, errors of fact do not appear in this magazine. Do you have anything to say for yourself? - I don't think so. - This isn't the first time. I've given you the benefit of the doubt before. You seem to be unable to perform the duties required for this job. I'd like to hear what you have to say. I assume I'm fired. That's correct. Effective immediately. Anything else? I'm sorry. I know you are. - Well? - It was nice working with you. - No. She didn't? She couldn't. - Yes, she did. - What exactly did she say? - The gist of it was that I'm fired. You didn't have enough time. Everybody knows John Martin's research is sloppy. - She can't do that. - Go to the arbitration committee. - The way they handled the schedule. - Look, it doesn't matter! - I'll clean this up tomorrow. - Jamie. Listen, can we have lunch tomorrow? I'd really like to talk to you. Yeah, Meg. Sure. Are you all right? Well. Oh, your brother called again. He says he's gotta talk to you. I don't wanna talk to my brother. Lunch. Tomorrow. Don't forget. You wanna buy a ferret? No. No, thanks. Loose joints? Genuine Hawaiian sens. His name is Fred. - What else you got? - Monkeys, boas, coke. - How much? - $50 a half. Half what? Half borax, half mannitol? Pure stuff. Uncut. Sure. No, I can't make the 50. If it's 50. - If it's 50, I can't buy Fred. - You're gonna buy Fred too? - How much is he? - I'll make you a good deal. One more. This is it. - Step a little lighter. - - It's locked. - No problem. - - Calm down, Fred. Give me the leash. - I don't have it. - I gave it to you. - I don't have it. - All right. Let me just put him in a drawer. Hold this. All right. Calm down, Fred. You're about to become the mascot for the whole department. A real live ferret for the fact checkers. OK. - Let him out. - Fuck, no. You let him out. - OK, but hold the flashlight. - I'll hold the flashlight. All righty. OK. Easy now. Hi, Fred. Hi, buddy. Oh, Jesus! Get it off! Get it off! Throw it! Throw it! Not at me! Argh! Argh! - Ah! - Jesus Christ! - Jamie, get this fucking thing off me! - I can't. I'm bleeding here, Tad. Jesus Christ! Get the fuck off of me! Jamie! Oh, my God. Come here, let me see. - Oh, shit. - Jesus. Look at this. One more inch. - Oh, God. - What's going on in here? - Oh, fuck. - Is the door locked? Oh, shit. I know you're in there. Pygmies. I'm surrounded by pygmies. Alex, hi. I lost my wallet in here this morning. I just came back to find it. - Got it. - He found it. - I knew the giants. - Yeah. I worked with the giants. Guys whose words words went out into the worid and kicked some ass. All right! OK. Giris, then. Women, whatever. Lillian Hellman, Katherine Anne Porter, Anaïïs Nin and Dorothy Parker. I'm talking talent here, male or female. Not like these precious turds around today. These goddamn pygmies and their pygmy talent. - Fred. - Jesus. What the hell is that thing? Oh, no. - Let's get outta here. - I can't leave him like this. - What? You wanna explain this? Let's go. - Shit! Just a minute. - All right, Alex? - He's fine. Get the suitcase. - Where's Fred? - He went down the hall. Fred. Freddie. - Fuck Fred. Let's get outta here. - You're on your own, Fred. Fitz. and Faulkner. Faulkner and Theodore. Dreiser. I can't remember when I had my last tetanus shot. I wonder if it needs stitches. Ow! Let me see. - Nah, I don't think so. - No? If Fred was rabid, he wouldn't have been so friendly before you put him in the case. I hear rabies shots are really painful. They put needles in your dick or something. Give me your hand. Oh! Oh! Oh! Great. Shit. So much for antiseptic. Now for anaesthetic. I can see the headline in the <i>Post</i> now: "Faulkner Friend Falls Afoul of Furry Fiend." <i>"De casibus virorum illustrium",</i> as we used to say in the old Latin class. - What does that mean? - Something about the fall of famous men. - Yeah. - Hey. - Don't answer that. - I think it's Warner. Heartbreak Hotel. - Yo, Michael. - I'm not home. No. How's it going on the home front? Yeah. No, Jamie's not here right now. Amanda's not here either. Me? I'm sitting here watering the plants. They got this real thirsty jade tree. Yeah. Would I kid you, Michael? Yeah. No, I think they took off to the Hamptons. Yeah. Look, Michael, I gotta take off. I'm gonna leave a message, I promise. Bye-bye. What's wrong with Michael? He sounds really upset. I don't wanna talk about it. OK. I almost forgot. Here's the invitation to the fashion show. Jesus Christ. Thanks a lot for taking Vicky off my hands last night. Inge is eternally grateful. My pleasure. - Really? You got lucky, did you? - None of your goddamn business. You never really liked Amanda much, did you? God knows she wasn't hard to look at. I don't know why you felt like you had to marry her. Yeah. I've been wondering the same thing. - Did you see the sign on her forehead? - What sign? "Space to let. Long and short-term leasing." We met in a bar. It was too dark to read. THURSDAY Facing the Facts. Your invitation, please. - Has it started yet? - Just. You'll have to sit in the back. - Double vodka. - The bar's closed. One for my date, too. Amanda. Amanda! Amanda. Amanda, I want an explanation. Amanda! I want answers. I want an explanation. I wanna know why. I just wanna know why. Amanda? Amanda, I want answers! I just wanna know why! Amanda? Amanda, you owe me. - You owe me an explanation! - Let's go. - That's my wife. - You're outta here, pal! - You're outta here! - Amanda! Amanda! You're outta here, buddy. Stay outta here! Jamie? Jamie. Jamie! Jamie, stop! Jamie! Jamie, stop! It's me, Michael. Jamie! Jamie! Hi. Remember me? I remember something about a lunch date. Damn. I'm sorry. By the way, whatever happened to my bagel? Toasted, no butter. How about dinner? One more meal with you could be the death of me. Tell me about Amanda. I get the feeling something bad happened. Oh. Amanda. My Amanda, the Amanda that I fell in love with, is a fictional character. I made her up. She doesn't exist. I didn't realise this until another Amanda did me in with a collect call from Paris. - Mind if I open another bottle? - Sure. Fabulous. I'm not sure which one did what and when she did it, but I do know I met one of 'em in Kansas City. I ever tell you that? - No. - I worked there, right out of college. <i>Kansas City Star.</i> Hemingway worked there. It was his first job, too. Anyway, I met her in a bar called the Bum Steer. I couldn't believe my luck. She walks right up to me, this gorgeous creature. I found out later that she overheard me tell the bartender I was from New York. I should've known. So, within a week, she moved in with me. My education, she said, excited her, and her desire to educate herself, with my help, excited me. She wanted to better herself. She had a really terrible childhood. Really grim. Divorce. Stepfathers - plural. Trailer parks. All that shit. My writing excited her, and the fact that she was excited, excited me. We got excited a lot together. So eight months later, we moved to New York. That was inevitable. She wanted to live a magazine ad, and I wanted to live a literary cliché. My parents weren't exactly thrilled with us living together, but they liked Amanda. They welcomed her like she was a fucking refugee, especially my mother. As soon as we got here, she was desperate to get married. She was worried I was gonna leave her. No, I think she was worried that my book would be published, I'd become famous, and I'd find somebody else. Anyway, after a year of living together, and the way she behaved - "Marry me, marry me, marry me" - we decided it was the thing to do, so we did it. So there she was - Mrs Conway on my arm. People were knocked out by her. All my friends said "God, she could be a model", which was exactly what she wanted to hear. So one day, she takes it upon herself to stop off at a modelling agency. Fuck me if she doesn't come home with a contract, like that. Said she was a natural. So then her career takes off. She's on magazine covers, commercials, layouts. All her dreams are coming true. Not true of mine. I was trying to write. I was working on a novel. Submitted some short stories to the magazine. But our life was complicated then. She was invited everywhere that I wasn't invited, and I was invited a lot. And getting out of bed at 6am to work on a novel just kept getting harder. and harder and harder. And then there was this change, this really subtle change. I know when I was out she was snooping around my desk to see if I, the writer. was making any progress. I know this because she started smiling. when I started telling people at cocktail parties that I was working on a book. Then, about two months ago, she was packing for a trip to Paris, for the collection. She started to cry. I asked her what was the matter. She said she was worried about the flight. She was nervous about the flight. By the time the cab came, she was fine. I kissed her at the door. She told me to water the plants. The night before she was due home, she called. Her voice sounded peculiar. She said she wasn't coming home this time. I didn't understand. She said her career was really taking off over there. So. a couple of days later, this man calls. He said he was her lawyer. Easiest thing all the way around, he said, was for me to sue her. for sexual abandonment. A legal term, he said. My friend Allagash says that not only was her leaving not surprising, it was inevitable. And my heartbreak is just a variation on the same old story. - Where's the john? - Right in there. Are you all right? Are you OK? I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. You're too high. "Contraceptive jelly." "Unscented. Colourless. Stainless." This is good news. "Megan Avery. Lithium carbonate. Take four times daily." Tetracycline. Valium. Victory. Valium. You're too high. You're too high. You gotta come down. Too high, too high. - You all right? - Fine. - Just getting the dishes out of the way. - That's a good policy. - You want some more wine? - No, I'm not much of a drinker any more. That's also a good policy. Have you been able to write at all? What are you gonna do? Do you have any job prospects? I've got some leads. I know an editor at Harper and Row who'd be happy to talk to you. Megan, I appreciate your efficiency, but getting fired has wiped my ass out, and I'd just as soon put the prospect of any future employment on hold right now. But thank you. Thanks very much. If you need a little money to tide you over, don't hesitate to ask. - You are terrific. You are a rare woman. - I just wanna see you back on your feet. - Everything's gonna work out. - A rare woman. Everything's gonna be all right. No. That's not what you want. - Jamie, that's not what you want. - Yeah. No. Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. No, no. Calm down. Calm down. Poor baby. Poor baby. - Poor little baby. - I gotta go. - Oh, fuck, I gotta go. - Jamie, are you all right? I'm fine. Thanks for the linguini and sympathy. - Jamie, are you all right? - I'm OK. I'm OK. Michael. - How'd you get in here? - I talked to the super. He let me in. - Sneaky little shit. - What the hell's going on with you, huh? I've been trying to track you down for over a week. - When did you get here? - Today. You saw me! - I thought you were somebody else. - Bullshit! I left about 150 messages at your office. Then I go to your office and they tell me that you're no longer employed there. - What's going on? - What do you wanna see me about? I don't <i>wanna</i> see you. I'd just as soon leave you to drown in coke, or whatever it is you're doing, but Dad's worried about you, and I'm worried about Dad. Why? How is Dad? Oh, what do you care? Dad's in California on business. At least, he was until last night. He called me to make sure you're coming home. Now, since you never call or answer, here I am. - Now, you're coming back with me. - OK. - D'you hear me? - OK! Tomorrow's the anniversary - one year - in case you've forgotten. We're gonna spread her ashes in the lake, and Dad wants you to be there. Jamie? - You've forgotten Mom completely. - Don't get righteous with me. - You haven't seen Dad since. - Shut up! - Don't tell me to shut up! - Shut up! Shut the fuck up, OK? I'll be there! Shut up! Shut up! Uh. Can I make a sandwich? Help yourself. Where's Amanda? - Shopping. - At this time of night? Find everything you need in there? Well, the milk is sour, this bread is mouldy. What the hell do you live on? - A lot of things that start with D. - What? Amanda isn't shopping, Mike. Amanda left me. I'm sorry. I never really liked Amanda much. To tell you the truth, I always thought she was a fake. I was just thinking, when Mom was sick, Amanda was really cold and distant. It's like she resented Mom dying or something. Well. you think you would have married her if Mom hadn't been sick? Mom never said it would do her heart good to see you get married, but you wanted her to be happy, and she wanted you to be happy. In the end, you might've confused what she wanted with what Amanda wanted. You want a couple of lines? Uh, no, thanks. - You mind if I take a shower? - No, would you, Mike? That'd be great. You know, Jamie, it was exactly a year ago today that you came home. I'm gonna hop in the shower. Good. - Have you slept with a lot of giris? - - Mom, really, that's. - Oh, come on. What's the matter? Yeah. - Yes, Mom, there have been some giris. - Really? - Mom, I'm not going into details. - Why not? - It's embarrassing. - Don't be embarrassed. Just, you know, tell me what it's like. Do you enjoy it? Yeah. Yeah, I like it. You've slept with giris that you haven't been in love with? Is it different when you're in love? Sure. It's better. Mm-hm. What about Sally Keegan? Did you sleep with her? Once. The night of the prom. I thought so. What about Stephanie Bates? - Oh, God. - Hm? How do you know this stuff? You were the funniest little boy. You were an awful baby. You were a real screamer. You cried through the night. There were some nights. we had to take you out, put you in the car, and drive you around, to get you to sleep. You were something. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Yes. Oh! - The pain. - Mom, let me give you the morphine, OK? - No, wait. - Let me just give you a shot. Wait. You know what this is like, this pain? This is like when you were born. It sounds crazy, I know, but that's exactly what it's like. It was that bad? Terrible. Oh! You just didn't wanna come out. Oh! I didn't think I'd live through it. Now you know. why I love you so much. So much. Mom? The pain's going away. That's good. That's good. Are you still holding my hand? Yes, I am. Good, honey. Don't let go. - What? - <i>It's Allagash. I'm at a party.</i> - <i>Your presence is requested.</i> - My brother's here, Tad. I can't go. <i>Amanda's here.</i> - Where is it? - <i>Two Staple Street.</i> I'll be there. Michael, I'm going out. Jamie! Taxi! Barbara? Where's Allagash? - I think he's somewhere over there. - Thanks. Allagash. - Where is she? - Easy, Jamie. You look ready to detonate. - Whose party is this? - The heir to some fast-food fortune. - Jamie, I'd like you to meet Stevie. - D'you wanna dance? Maybe later. Where is she? Who? Your formerly deceased, not yet ex-wife? Right. Let me tell you something. She didn't come alone. She's got a new friend. Some famous French photographer. She's telling everybody he's gonna make her a star. Hi. Hi. So. how's it going? "How's it going?" Yeah. "How's it going?" "How's it going?" Oh, fine. How's it going? Oh, fuck! Come on. - Stevie, can you get a glass of water? - Here, take my drink. It's OK. It's OK. - He got blood on that column. - Out of the way. He's an epileptic. I am not. He's an emotional quadriplegic. "How's it going?" I need some help. Whatever that is. I can't straighten everything out all in one night. - Hello? - <i>Vicky.</i> Sorry for calling so late, or so early, whatever it is. What is it? - Who is this? - <i>It's Jamie.</i> Oh, Jamie. What time is it? It's late. I'm in New York. - I just wanted to talk. - <i>You're with Tad?</i> Yeah, I was with Tad. Tad's around here someplace. - <i>Is something wrong?</i> - I wanted to tell you that my mom died. Oh, God. I'm sorry. - <i>When?</i> - A year ago. I didn't tell you before, so I just wanted to tell you now. It seemed important. I'm sorry. I tried to block her out of my mind, but I think I owe it to her to remember. And I was thinking tonight, when she found out that she had cancer, she was talking to Michael and me. - <i>Michael?</i> - My brother. She said if the pain became unbearable, she wanted us to help her. you know, end it all. But she. We had this prescription for morphine, so there was this option. So, anyway, the pain got real bad and I asked her and she said. She said that when you're dying, you have a responsibility to the living. I was amazed that she said that, you know? The way that she felt. I was thinking that we have a responsibility to the dead. The living, I mean. God, does any of this make any sense? Yeah, maybe. I can't tell now, Jamie. Can I call you back later today or tomorrow or whatever it is? Yeah, call me. Please call me whenever. Are you sure you're all right? My brain's trying to find a way out of its skull. And I'm afraid of just about everything. But I'm OK. - Get some sleep, OK? - <i>I will.</i> - Call me if you can't. - Thanks, Vicky. Good night. Good night. Hey, coach! Where are you going? Come on, Inge just got here. I want you to meet her. You can't take off now. Things are getting good. You know, Allagash, I just realised something. - What's that? - You and Amanda. would make a terrific couple. Hey.

Monsieur Foine. Yes, monsieur? Could I speak to you for a moment? Well, I've been studying painting with you for some time now. Do you think it's worth my while Why do you ask? There's no sense in staying unless I have talent. If you are not certain about your talent, why stay till now? Because all this is so beautiful to me. In my youth, it was also beautiful to me. But now, it is the city of lost illusions. Is your studio very far? No. Not very. Let us go there. You will show me what you have done. Yes. Have you any money? A little. Not enough to live on. Then, I must tell you. There is no talent here, merely industry and intelligence. You will never be anything but mediocre. And it is very cruel to discover one's mediocrity only when it is too late. I know. That name does not belong there. It belongs somewhere else. Take your courage in both your hands and make something of your life. Have you anything in mind? Well, you see. ..I have my limitations. I've always been interested in medicine. If one can't be great, at least one can be of some use to people. I don't know why I should 'ave such a thing. Upon my word, I don't! I've never had a day's illness in my life. It's a winter cough. Many middle-aged women have it. Well, I never! No-one's ever called me middle-aged before. It's time you got used to it. All the same. You're a nice one, deerie. I can't say the same for you. Good day, madam. The rest of you come back tomorrow. Get him ready. All right, sir. Are you the boy's father? Yes, sir. What's the matter with you now? You see what the matter is. The boy has a club foot. Carey, you'd better take this case. It's a subject you ought to know something about. It's only for the looks of the thing. I don't find it no trouble. That's wonderful. I did. That's cos you let them go on at you. You're a little slow, Carey. I'll instruct the class. There are many varieties of club feet. This is less interesting. Yours would prove more interesting. Yes. I believe so. Mind taking off your sock, Carey? No. Not at all. Keeps his feet nice and clean, doesn't he? Hm, yes. Talipes equinovarus - malformation requiring you to walk on the outside of the foot. A very interesting example, I must say! Do you mind if I have a look? Congenital club foot. In simple language, a foot twisted inward. The cause is not clear. Hereditary influence plays a part. Dr Little traces recurring deformity through four generations. When you've quite finished. I say, old man, I like that! French, isn't she? Yes. She was a model in Paris. I can't, for the life of me, understand why you gave up painting. I'd rather look at that all day long, than at this! Woman, you know! You can tell by the, er, pelvis. I like 'em with a little more. There's life in the old girl yet! Don't inhale, deerie! I say! I've got to be getting along! A little matter of a barmaid at the Crown & Anchor. Very nice, too! Cheerie-o! Funny fellow, isn't he? It must have been wonderful It was. You really knew all those Some of them. I wonder if you couldn't help me. In what way? There's a girl and I can't get anywhere with her. You've been to Paris and all that. I'm sure you can give me a starter. I'd ask Griffiths, only he couldn't remember whom he was doing it for. You know, say something to make her laugh. What? You don't believe it? You are too suspicious! I say, she's marvellous, isn't she? No. She's anaemic. You don't suppose she likes Of course. Now's your chance. Say something. Well, I see your friend's going. I don't know what you mean. The nobleman with the sandy moustache. Has he left you for another? Some people would do better to mind their own business. Why? You have a very nice back. Am I on speaking terms with your back? Woman, you know. You can tell by the pelvis. And that.calls himself a gentleman! I apologise. What for? I promised you something charming. She's turned out to be ill-natured and contemptible. You don't suppose I care what an anaemic waitress says to me? Well, I do. I must be going. Coming along? No, I think I'll have some more tea. Anything you want? Yes, if you don't mind. I'd like to talk to you. Filthy weather, isn't it? Makes no difference to me. I have to be here all day. Oh, I only wanted to say Well, say it. You know, you have a lovely smile. You should use it more often. Now, don't go spoofing me. A girl that works hard all day don't have much reason to smile. Perhaps I could find a reason. Will you let me try? I don't know whether I will or whether I won't. I hope you'll decide you will. Huh! Like that, unt that, like so! That is a nice little hand. Excuse me, won't you? Ja ja. How do you do? You seem in a great hurry. I've been waiting ten minutes. I didn't know you could draw! Didn't you? That meant to be me? Looks like you. If you look at it that way. Tea? You are a strange sort. I say, will you dine with me some time? We'll go to the theatre? I don't mind. When will you come? I'm off Thursdays. All right, Thursday, seven o'clock Victoria Station? All right. I'll meet you at Victoria in the second class waiting room. All tickets, please! Show your tickets. All tickets, please! All tickets, please! Show your tickets. All tickets, please! Boat train, platform 19! All tickets, please.! I thought you were never coming. I like that! After keeping ME waiting. I almost went home. I was in the second class waiting room. Is it likely I'd sit in the second class when I could sit in the first? For a gentleman of brains, you don't use 'em! Perhaps not. Anyway, you're here, so it's all right, isn't it? You certainly do make a girl feel important. I love that music. Whenever I hear it, I think of you. How pale you are. How strange, how cold. You ARE going it! Do you always order champagne? No. Why did you do it now? I was hoping it would make you more friendly. Do you think it will? Well, there's one thing I can say for you. Gentleman, in every sense of the word. May I see you again? I don't mind. Doesn't it make any difference to you? No. If you don't take me out, someone else will. I'll say good night here. Won't you stay for a moment? No. Why not? People would think I don't know what. I love that music. Whenever I hear it, I think of you. Whenever I hear it, I think of us. I've never danced with anyone who danced like you. I've been looking for you all my life. You don't have much to do with your time. I should be studying. Then why don't you? Well, I'd rather see you. Any of the girls noticed, you're waiting for me? I don't know. What difference does it make? They all laugh at you. Do they? Why? Say you're in love with me. May I call you Mildred? I don't mind. Look here, don't say that any more, will you? Why not? Well, I'll call you Mildred and you call me Philip, will you? I'll think on it. I, um.I'm a little awkward at this but will you kiss me good night? No. Oh, Mildred. Will you come to the theatre with me on Saturday? I don't mind. You're sure they're for Saturday? Certainly. My name is Miller, Emile Miller. We should know each other. Why? Well, we are both interested in the same thing. Thing? My dear young man, you are so. so. er. artistic. You, you should be more. Like so! Thanks. Thanks very much. That's all right. Keep the change. What time shall I see you? I forgot to tell you, Philip. I can't go. W. Why not? Me aunt's ill. Oh. Well! What's the sense in that? You don't suppose I want to go by myself? I only got them for your sake. Well you needn't go on about it. Violets! Sweet violets! Sweet violets, tuppence a bunch. Violets! Sweet violets. You're spying on me. I thought you was a gentleman, in every sense of the word. Are you going out with Miller? No. Well, what if I am? I can go out with him if I want to, can't I? He's keeping you waiting, isn't he? I'd rather wait for him than have you waiting for me. Won't you change your mind? I'll get some more tickets. No. You keep looking for him the way I look for you. If you don't come out with me tonight you'll never see me again. Good riddance to bad rubbish. Oh, drink? Desire? Sorry, old boy. How about a nice large beer, huh? Wouldn't help? What would? Oh, Phil. Leave it. Why? What for? Shows the waiter who you are. He knows who YOU are. And so do I. What do you mean? I'm sorry. I.didn't mean. You're a bit too superior for me, my fine young friend. Mildred! Of course you don't like me. I'm a cripple. No, Phil. It isn't that. I've felt it all along. Foolish. Mind my hat, silly! You ARE clumsy! Off your nut! What practice can you expect with a wife like that? I don't know. Let me ask you something. Why do you want to marry this girl? Because I'm so in love with her. Aah! That ring with a little design is very popular, sir. We sell a great many of them. They're 30 shillings. Thank you, sir. Philip, were you surprised when I asked you to take me to dinner? I was delighted. Were you? Yeah. Why? You've been so sweet to me all day and I've got something to ask you. It makes it so much easier for me. Makes it easier for me, too. I've something to tell you. No, no. Let me tell you first. There it is. I want you to marry me. I'm so sorry, Philip. That's what I was about to tell you. You shouldn't have waited so long. The fact is, I'm going to be married. Are you? To whom? A man I know. He earns very good money. Yes, I'm.I'm sure of it. Now, you won't go on about it, will you, Philip? All right. I'm getting on. I'm 24. Time I settled down. This gentleman earns £7 a week. He's got good prospects. Well, this is goodbye. I hate to eat and run, Philip. I'm going to the theatre with the gentleman that I'm going to marry. All the latest films of the day.! Taxi. Have you seen her since? No. London is the largest city in the world and you know the cure for ONE woman. Another. Ha ha! Right, ho! Norah, you don't read such junk, do you? No. I write it. What? That's how I earn my living. I didn't know. Successful? Very. I have an immense popularity amongst kitchen maids. They think me so refined. Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about us. Norah, y-you're not really fond of me, are you? For a clever boy, you ask such foolish questions. Oh, my dear. It never struck me Pleased? Delighted. And so proud and so happy and so. So grateful. I wish you hadn't been in love with. What was her name? Mildred. Because if she hadn't treated you so abominably it wouldn't have taken you so long to understand how I feel. I saw you! I wasn't very quick! Let's go out and play. Not until you've passed that exam. Tell me, darling. What do you get out of this? You'll never know. I'm afraid you don't get much fun with me. I wish. If only I could take you dancing. I know how you love it. Philip, it's very silly to be so sensitive about your foot. Other people don't think about it as much as you. They notice it when they first see you then forget about it. You know, I only speak of it because I love you. I don't want it to make you unhappy. Now, will you please stay here and go on cramming for that exam? There's a lady to see you, sir. I shouldn't have let her in but she was that upset. Norah! What do you want? I didn't think I'd ever see you again. What's the matter? He's left me. Emile. Oh, has he? Yes. Cos I'm going to have a baby. Why don't you sit down? I suppose you want him back. He'll never come back. Why not? He just won't, that's all. You're his wife. He has to provide for you. He won't give me anything. Even if he did, I wouldn't take it. Why not? No matter what's happened, I've got me pride. That's something, isn't it(?) Have you got any money? No. You'd better get yourself a place to live. After that, we'll see what can be done. Philip, you were always so good to me. I knew I could come to you. Look here, Mr Miller. I like to know what you intend to do about Mildred. I? What you expect me to do? Take care of her. You married her. I? I married Mildred? Ach! I married. This one. I'd still like to know what you intend to do about it. Me? I can do nothing. One man cannot solution the problem of the unmarried mother. Why didn't you tell me? I just couldn't. Well, brace up. Everything will be all right. Philip. Do you still.like me? Really? Strange as it may seem, I always have. I suppose I always shall. I did everything I could to make you love me. I thought you were incapable of loving anybody. It seems horrible to think that you were willing to sacrifice everything for that man. I'm awfully sorry, Philip. I shall never forget you wanted to marry me. Philip? Yes? You've been so nice to me. ..I'll do anything you want. Will you? Why? Why, I owe it to you. Oh. Do you? You're not angry. No. Then you'll stay and have Yes, if you want me to. Of course, Philip. Nothing could delight me more. Just a moment and I'll have everything ready. Come in. Hello, darling. Norah! How did you happen to come? Just passing by. I wanted to rub my nose against your door. Philip, why haven't I heard from you? I was just going to write. Why haven't you come to see me? Well, I.I've been busy. Why so silent? Well, you see. Norah, I've got something strange to tell you. You've been so good to me, it only makes it harder. Philip, what's wrong? I'm sorry. It's just over. You mean you don't care for me any more? I'm afraid so. What have I done? Nothing. You've been wonderful to me. It's just that I. Of course, I knew you never loved me as much as I loved you. Yes, I'm afraid that's usually the case. There's usually one who loves and one who is loved. Oh, it's always the same. You want a man to be nice to you, you have to be rotten to him. If you treat a man honestly, you. Philip, there's someone else. Yes. Who is she? Mildred. She's come back. After all she's done. How could you? That's what I'd like to know. It's just as though you're bound to her in some way. Yes. As I am to you. And she was to Miller. As every human being is to something or other. Funny looking little thing, isn't it? I can't believe it's mine. Now, if you'll excuse me. So glad it's over, darling. You've been so good to me, Philip. From now on, things will be different. Now, you will take good care of her, won't you? That I will, ma'am. Good day. Good day. I know you don't like it, Philip. I can't do anything else I suppose not. Be sure and go over on Sundays and see the baby's taken care of. I will. What are we going to do this afternoon? I asked Griffiths to come over. Oh, did you? Why? I know you find him amusing and I'm always afraid of boring you. Hello, hello, hello. Sorry I'm late. Had to get rid of a girl. Why didn't you bring her? I'm not interested in MY girl. I'm interested in other men's girls. D'you like me? Really, I'm too hungry to know. I think I like you lots. I'd like you more if he took us out to dinner. I'd tell you stories. You'll have a wonderful time. What would he do? Ooh, pay the bill. I said, "What's that? Your missus? I thought it was your sister!" Oh, allez-up! Allez-up! "Thought it was your sister!" Good night, Philip. Good night. Just a moment. Are you in love with Mildred? I? That's what you've been so funny about! My dear old boy. Look here. It doesn't matter to you, Harry. You've got so many women. Don't take Mildred away from me. My dear old boy! She's nothing to me at all! Nothing at all! Do you like it, Philip? Very much. So nice of you to give it to me. What are you thinking about? You were having quite a flirtation with Griffiths last night. Yes I was, wasn't I? Matter of fact, well. I'm sort of in love with him. I'm not surprised! What do you mean? Well Griffiths is good looking, he amusing, he says the kind things that make you laugh. I'll thank you not to make fun of me. You are a bit too superior for me you fine young friend. Oh for heavens sake Mildred, I wasn't making fun of you. Well you certainly don't act as if it's serious. I don't think it is. Why not? Griffiths isn't in love with you. How do you know? I asked him. Would you like to read a letter I got from him this morning? "I've been up all night thinking about you. "I have just sent for a messenger to take this to you in the dawn. "You've no notion of the time I had with your friend last night. "He kept asking me if I love you and of course what could I say? "He'll doubtless tell you all this, "so I'm making sure that you." Well? Can't help it if I love him, can I? No. I suppose not. Then what is going on about? Nothing. Only I was fool enough to think that you cared for me. I do, Philip. As a friend. Not in any other way. But you do care for Griffiths in the other way. But you're cold. That sort of thing doesn't mean anything to you. That's what YOU think. It's no use going on about it, Philip. You said yourself that I couldn't help it if I'm in love with him. If there's anything else to be said, say it. That's a nice dress you have on, Mildred. I couldn't afford it, but I paid for it. You have a nice apartment. I couldn't afford it but I. If you were a gentleman, would you throw what you've done in my face? Do you think it matters to me whether I'm a gentleman or not? If I were, you don't suppose I'd care for a cheap vulgar. I'm sorry, Philip. I didn't want to end this way. Harry's waiting for me. What do you intend to do? We're going to Paris. Get out. Get out! I've moved three times and each time this woman's hounded me down. I don't like to do this but. All right, sir. I'll move her on. Come on, young lady. You can't stay here. Come on, now. Look here, Carey. Mildred and I are all washed up. Too bad. Excuse me. I'm due in the ward. Anything interesting, Carey? I was just thinking what an unusual name you have. An old Yorkshire name. Once took a day's riding across our estates. And here I am in a charity hospital because my father loved fast women and slow horses. How the mighty are fallen! Hello! Hello, Father. Carey, this is my daughter, christened Maria del Sol. Her mother called her Sally. This young man is a student here. He's been nice to me. With some inducement, he might be nice to YOU. Now, Father. Father's particular genius is saying the wrong thing. He thinks it's fun to embarrass me. It is. Try it some time, Carey. I will, if I get the chance. You shall have it! You're coming to see us the first Sunday I am home. Oh, yes. Please do. What a quaint house! Yes, but it's not very sanitary. Sanitation be hanged! Give me art! I've got nine children and they thrive on bad drains. Look at that, now. I am, with great admiration. Shall I bring the ale, Father? Right, m'girl. The sooner the better. I hope you didn't have the table in here on my account. I'd be quiet happy to have had dinner with Mrs. Athelny and the children. Oh, no. I always take meals by myself. I like these antique customs. I don't think women ought to sit down at table with men. Don't you? Why not? It ruins conversation. It's bad for them. Puts ideas in their heads! Women are never at ease when they have ideas. You sound like the voice of old England. I am, sir. This fine, old Yorkshire pudding gives me strength to carry on. Now stop getting up and down like jumping Jack every time she comes in the room. She doesn't want you to make a fuss about it, do you Sally? She won't think it rude if you sit still. She don't care a hang for chivalry, do you, Sally? No, Father. You speak quietly while eyeing the young man so boldly. Yes, Father. You know what I'm talking about Sally? How could I, darling? You're so clever. Don't stand behind me in order to make eyes at him. Better get Philip some more ale. My word! Is there anything better than English ale? Let us thank God for simple pleasures - a good appetite, roast beef and beer. I was married to a lady once. Good heavens! Never marry a lady, my boy! Oh, really? Why? Because a lady has a point of view, a personality and an individuality all the devil you with. You want a wife who can cook dinner and look after your children. Don't you think so, Sally? I think you'd talk the hind leg of the donkey. It's clean fun. Now, Sally waited on me, I'll wait on you. Take my chair while I fetch you and the young man some cheese. Thank you, Father. What do you think of us? You don't know what this means to me. I practically never had family. This is the only place I've known that's had the quality of.home. Thank you, Father. It's no use mooning over her, Carey. Sally never kisses a gentleman until he's been here twice. Well, you must ask me again, some time. Do it yourself! Why don't you come next Sunday? May I walk to the station with you? No. Why not? It's too late and you're a child. I'm 20. Let's talk it over when you're 30. Did you hear what I said, old man? Yes, I heard. Sorry if I brought up a painful subject. I thought you'd be interested to hear about Mildred. Sorry she's had a bad time. I gave her all I could. But you know me, always stony broke. I thought perhaps you'd want to. I can't do anything. Got another cigarette? I don't blame you. I wouldn't have told you. She asked me to give you her address. Gave me a jolt, seeing her with that baby, asking for something to eat. She had the baby with her? Yes. Not difficult to imagine her next step. Baby all right? I'm very grateful to you, Philip. If I could afford it, I'd have given you a place of your own. As it is, you're welcome to my room. I don't know what would become of me and.baby. if you hadn't taken us in. You'd have got on, I expect. You've always been much nicer to me than I deserved. I'm beginning to realise how silly I've been. You couldn't help how you felt. Let's not talk about it, shall we? I don't feel like that now. Look here, Mildred. Let's have no misunderstanding about this. The reason you're here is. I know. Because you once liked me enough to want to marry me. Yes. Well, at least I can cook for you and keep your flat clean. Maybe some day you'll. you'll feel better about me and things will be like they used to be. Oh, thanks. I'll smoke it later. Well, er. Good night. Good night. Landlady came upstairs a little while ago. She said, "Mrs Carey," she said. "How can you stand it?" What's the matter with them? They're indecent. Disgusting, I calls it. To have drawings of naked people about. If you want to know what I think, I've half a mind to take them down. You'll do nothing of the kind. I love those pictures, Mildred. I love them for what they were meant to be. What happened to it? Hm? What? The way you used to love me. Oh, I don't know. I was disappointed so often and hurt so much. What difference does it make? Nothing. Only, remember how you got when I was so cold to you? You're getting me that way cos you're so cold to me. No-one else, is there? He's not in love with anybody. Where were you? Altherneys'. What are you doing up? I couldn't sleep. Hadn't you better put on something warmer? Oh, I'll be all right. Just let me stay here. Phil. Phil, I love you so. Oh, nonsense. T'isn't. I can't live without you. Please get up. You're making a fool of yourself and a fool of me. Oh, Phil. Please. I can't go on like this. Nonsense. You haven't anywhere to go. Stay as long as you like. But with the definite understanding. You disgust me. Me? I disgust YOU? You. You! You're too fine! You won't have me but you sit here all night looking at your naked females! Mildred. You cad! You dirty swine! I never cared for you, not once. I was always making a fool of you. You bored me stiff. It made me sick when I let you kiss me. I did it because you begged me. You drove me crazy! And after you kissed me, I always use to wipe my mouth! Well, I made up for it. For every kiss, we laughed at you. Miller and me, and Griffiths and me. We laughed at you. Because you were such a mug, a mug, a mug! You gippy-legged monster! You're a cripple! A cripple! You love these things. You love what they were meant to be. Well, here's what they were meant to be! You want to be a doctor! This will take care of your medical school. You're leaving? ..Why? My money's gone. What do you intend to do? Oh. Anything. Before you go out into the world, don't you think we ought to do something about that foot? Think it'll do any good? I'll know better tomorrow. How are you, Philip? I'm all right, Sally. How's your foot? Well. Let's try it, shall we? All right. Careful now. No openings. Sorry, nothing today. All situations filled. No experience? Can't use you. Nothing today. Sorry, no vacancies. No openings. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Why haven't you been to see us? Oh, I don't know. I've had things to do. You've been putting on weight. I'm sure you haven't! Why do you say that? The way Oh! That's only my look! It's more than that. I sent you a note and when you didn't answer I went to your room. Your landlady said she had to put you out. Hello, Philip! My dear fellow, by pre-arranged signal, my daughter communicated to me confirmation of our suspicions. As you know, I've been on the beach most of my life. In Tahiti, I was President of the Beachcombers' Union! I would like to enquire into your amateur standing. Where have you been staying? Oh.anywhere. Why didn't you come here? False modesty, I suppose. Now, stop being an Englishman. When a man's on his uppers, it's time he came down to Earth. We want you here with us. Well, I. Thanks very much, but. You're to stay until you get your bearings. I want no more fine talk about it. It's all arranged. Well. Well, here goes my amateur standing. I-I really have no place to go. It's awfully good of you. Nonsense! The house is completely unsanitary. You'll wind up with some foul disease! Let him alone, Father. I want to talk to him. I suppose youth must be served. But I'm sick and tired of serving it. Nine of them! Will that do? Looks as if it might. Wouldn't be a nice night to be out. Not really. No. It's going to be jolly having you here. I hope I shan't have to stay very long. Why? I can't go on like this, you know. I need a job. Father and I discussed that. There isn't much you've overlooked. I'll have to sew that on, too. And Father has a job for you. Has he? Where? Where he works. You're walking all right now. I saw you in the window. I never thought you'd come to that. You're very hoarse. Throat sore? You haven't forgotten your doctoring, have you? No. Because.that's what I want to see you about. Why not go to a doctor? There's the Free Hospital. All them students staring at me? What seems to be the trouble? Well, I cough all the time. Let's have a look at your throat. Phil. It's not.me lungs, is it? Where's the baby? She died last summer. Oh. You might say you're sorry. I'm not. I'm very glad. I'm afraid I can't help you much. Don't leave me, Philip. I know I've treated you shocking. But don't leave me. Not yet, please. There's no-one I can go to. You're the only one that treated me like I was human. You're a gentleman, Philip. The only one I've ever met. Some things you'll need. Our last day. Why, Sally! Darling. I was so determined not to let you see. Well, that's sweet of you to care because I'm going away. I suppose I'm a fool to care, but it doesn't mean you have to do anything about it. You can't help it because someone loves you and you don't love back. Sally, look at me. Darling, do you think you'll always feel like this about me? Yes. I've known it since the first time you came to our house. I thought at first that I meant something to you, too. Oh, but you did. You do. When I come back, if you feel the same, will you marry me, darling? Don't you mean if YOU feel the same? This is what you might call the irony of fate. Come on now. Be quick. Get her out of here. I don't want the likes of her on me hands. I understand there's an interesting Don't go in there. Why not? If you please. It's no use. Philip, I'm sorry I'm late. You're not. I'm not going. What's that? My wedding present to my wife. When do you intend to marry me? Right away. Thank you, Philip. Oh, I beg your pardon. You don't seem very pleased. Well, I am and I'm not. Why? I'm afraid it's only a noble gesture. That's not enough for marriage. No, Sally. It isn't just that. I like you far too much to stand in your way. Philip, you're free. Yes, but suddenly there's nowhere to go. Taxi, sir? No, thanks. I had to be free to realise that, free to understand that all those years I dreamed of escape was because I was limping through life. Taxi, sir? No, thank you! And because I was bound up with a person who was incredible to me. That's all over. I'm not limping any more. My life's all right. Then why don't you go? Because everything that's beautiful to me is right here. Won't you please marry me, Sally? If you like. But don't you want to? Well, there's no-one else I'd marry. How about a taxi, sir? What? How about a taxi? Yes. "Outside, the night was as black as a coal miner's. "Outside, the night was as black as a coal miner's T-shirt. "I turned slowly away from the window. "Then, for the first time, she could see the automatic in my hand. "Her eyes had that funny, mad look I'd come to know and fear. "Her moist red lips were half-parted. "Then slowly, her eyes never leaving my face, "she began, one button at a time, to undo the front of her sweater. " - Robert! - What? What is it? Nothing. Robert, I want a divorce. No. Robert, I want a. No. Robert, I want a divorce. Robert! I want a divorce. Can't you do any better than that? No. I think it's a very good idea. As a matter of fact, the same thought had occurred to me. You're lying in your teeth. That's a typically childish and immature way of trying to save face. The same thought had occurred to me. You just want me to feel that you're the one that wants a divorce. Well, you're not. I'm the one that wants the divorce. I'm the one. Just remember that. I'm the one. I don't want to disillusion you, but for the past six months I've been trying to get up enough courage to mention the subject myself. Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie! - I've thought about it constantly. - Lie! Lie! As a matter of fact, I even mentioned it to Charlie Nelson. Lie. You discussed this with Charlie Nelson? I did not say I discussed it. I just said I mentioned it.
